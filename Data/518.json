Due to the fragility of the Antarctic environment, only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the [[ecological footprint]].\nThe infrastructure of land, water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable. \nCurrently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists a year depend on the Antarctic transportation system.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2016"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Land transport", "paragraphs": "\n===Roads===\n\nWinds continuously blow snow on roads in Antarctica.\n\nThe [[South Pole Traverse]] (McMurdo\u2013South Pole highway) is approximately {{convert|1450|km|abbr=on}} long and links the United States' [[McMurdo Station]] on the coast to the [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]].
