The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"[[Year of the Four Emperors]]\" over the imperial succession.\n\nAugustus was born '''Gaius Octavius''' into an old and wealthy [[equites|equestrian branch]] of the [[plebs|plebeian]] [[Octavia (gens)|''gens'' Octavia]]. His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir. Along with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], he formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the [[Battle of Philippi]], the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as ''de facto'' [[Roman dictator|dictators]]. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] by Octavian in 31 BC.\n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], the [[Roman magistrate|executive magistrates]], and the [[Roman assemblies|legislative assemblies]]. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], and those of [[tribune]] and [[Roman censor|censor]]. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' (\"First Citizen\"). The resulting [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional framework]] became known as the Principate, the [[History of the Roman Empire|first phase of the Roman Empire]].\n\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]], expanding possessions in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]], but suffered a [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|major setback]] in [[Germania]]. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an [[cursus publicus|official courier system]], established a [[standing army]], established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. However, there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife [[Livia]] poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) [[Tiberius]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "first emperor of the Roman Empire"}]}, {"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the first Roman Emperor"}, {"name": "2", "value": "other uses"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Augustus (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "redirect-multi", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Octavius"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Octavian"}]}, {"name": "otherpeople5", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gaius Octavius (disambiguation)"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Gaius Julius Caesar"}]}, {"name": "pp-protected", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Infobox royalty\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Augustus"}, {"name": "title", "value": "[[Princeps|Princeps Civitatis]]"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Statue-Augustus.jpg"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "[[Augustus of Prima Porta]], 1st century"}, {"name": "succession", "value": "[[Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Roman Empire]]"}, {"name": "reign", "value": "16 January 27 BC \u2013<br />19 August AD 14 <br />(40 years)"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "[[Tiberius]]"}, {"name": "predecessor", "value": "Office established"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "{{plainlist|\n* [[Clodia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]] (42\u201340 BC; divorce)\n* [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]] (40\u201338 BC; divorce)\n* [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]] (37 BC\u2013AD 14; his death)}}"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "*[[Julia the Elder]]\n*[[Lucius Caesar]] (adopted)\n*[[Gaius Caesar]] (adopted)\n*[[Agrippa Postumus]] (adopted)\n*[[Tiberius]] (adopted)\n*[[Nero Claudius Drusus]] (disputed)"}, {"name": "regnal name", "value": "Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus"}, {"name": "house", "value": "[[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]"}, {"name": "father", "value": "{{plainlist|\n* [[ Gaius Octavius (father of Augustus) |Gaius Octavius]]\n* [[Julius Caesar]] (adoptive)}}"}, {"name": "mother", "value": "[[Atia Balba Caesonia]]"}, {"name": "birth_name", "value": "Gaius [[Octavius (praenomen)|Octavius]]"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "23 September 63 BC"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Rome]], [[Roman Italy|Italia]], [[Roman Republic]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "19 August AD 14 <br>(aged 75)"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Nola]], [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]], [[Roman Empire]]"}, {"name": "burial_place", "value": "[[Mausoleum of Augustus]], [[Rome]]"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "* [[Clodia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]] (42\u201340 BC; divorce)\n* [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]] (40\u201338 BC; divorce)\n* [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]] (37 BC\u2013AD 14; his death)"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "* [[ Gaius Octavius (father of Augustus) |Gaius Octavius]]\n* [[Julius Caesar]] (adoptive)"}]}, {"name": "Julio-Claudian dynasty\n", "values": [{"name": "image", "value": "[[File:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|frameless]]"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "A bust of Augustus, wearing the [[Civic Crown]].

Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son [[Caesarion]].

The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land.<ref name=\"eck 18\" /> There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former.<ref name=\"eck 18 19\">Eck (2003), 18\u201319.</ref> There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.<ref name=\"eck 19\">Eck (2003), 19.</ref>\n\n==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ====\n\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian [[Perusine War|forced them into surrender]] in early 40&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 19\" />\n[[File:Domus-augusti-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Fresco paintings inside the [[House of Augustus]], his residence during his reign as emperor.]]\n\nLucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]].<ref name=\"rowell 32\">Rowell (1962), 32.</ref> Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.<ref name=\"eck 20\">Eck (2003), 20.</ref> Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others.<ref name=\"rowell 32\" /> This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]].<ref name=\"eck 20\" />\n\n[[Sextus Pompeius]], the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, had established himself in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39&nbsp;BC.<ref>Scullard (1982), 162</ref> Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40&nbsp;BC when he married [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]], a sister or daughter of Pompeius's father-in-law [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]].

This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however.

Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces.

[[Gaul]] and the province of Hispania were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son [[Caesarion]]. Lepidus was left with the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]], stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.<ref name=\"eck 18\">Eck (2003), 18.</ref>\n\nOctavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land.<ref name=\"eck 18\" /> There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former.<ref name=\"eck 18 19\">Eck (2003), 18\u201319.</ref> There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.<ref name=\"eck 19\">Eck (2003), 19.</ref>\n\n==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ====\n\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian [[Perusine War|forced them into surrender]] in early 40&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 19\" />\n[[File:Domus-augusti-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Fresco paintings inside the [[House of Augustus]], his residence during his reign as emperor.]]\n\nLucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]].<ref name=\"rowell 32\">Rowell (1962), 32.</ref> Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.<ref name=\"eck 20\">Eck (2003), 20.</ref> Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others.<ref name=\"rowell 32\" /> This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]].<ref name=\"eck 20\" />\n\n[[Sextus Pompeius]], the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, had established himself in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39&nbsp;BC.<ref>Scullard (1982), 162</ref> Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40&nbsp;BC when he married [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]], a sister or daughter of Pompeius's father-in-law [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]].

This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her.

With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of ''[[Imperator]]'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.

Augustus prepared to hand down his [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus's supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed.<ref name=\"ccaa 25\">Eder (2005), 25.</ref><ref name=\"eck 56\">Eck (2003), 56.</ref> This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.<ref name=\"ccaa 38\">Gruen (2005), 38.</ref>\n\nAugustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.<ref name=\"ccaa 38 39\">Gruen (2005), 38\u201339.</ref> With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position;<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\">Stern, Gaius, ''Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus's vision of a new world order in 13 BC'', p. 23</ref> nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.<ref>Holland, pp. 294\u201395; Southern, p. 108</ref>\n\n[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] showing Augustus wearing a ''[[gorgoneion]]'' on a three layered [[sardonyx]] cameo, AD 20\u201350]]\nSoon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 26\">Eder (2005), 26.</ref> both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.<ref name=\"Davies, p. 259\" /> This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\" /> Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular ''[[imperium]]'' not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.<ref name=\"eck 57\">Eck (2003), 57.</ref>\n\n=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===\nThe primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]].<ref name=\"eck 56\" /><ref name=\"ccaa 37\">Gruen (2005), 37.</ref> When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.<ref name=\"eck 56 57\">Eck (2003), 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nA second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the \"Marcus Primus Affair\".<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\">Southern, p. 109; Holland, p. 299</ref> In late 24 or early 23&nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally.<ref>Wells, p. 53</ref> He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\">Southern, p. 108</ref> Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.<ref>Holland, p. 300</ref>\n\nSuch orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath\u2014i.e., before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius''\u2014as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\" /> Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&nbsp;\u2013 accusations that had already played out.<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\" />\n[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding a scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)]]\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.<ref>Syme, p. 333</ref> Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.<ref>Syme, p. 333; Holland, p. 300; Southern, p. 108</ref> Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Raaflaub, p. 426</ref>\n\nThe Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus's legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" />\n\n=== Additional powers ===\nDuring the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', the immunity given to a [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.<ref name=\"ccaa 36\">Gruen (2005), 36.</ref>\n\nThis power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /><ref name=\"eck 57 58\">Eck (2003), 57\u201358.</ref> Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate.<ref name=\"eck 59\">Eck (2003), 59.</ref>\n\nWith the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.<ref name=\"ccaa 30\">Eder (2005), 30.</ref> There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.<ref name=\"bunson 80\">Bunson (1994), 80.</ref> Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus's amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship.<ref name=\"bunson 427\">Bunson (1994), 427.</ref>\n\n[[File:August Labicana Massimo Inv56230 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Via Labicana Augustus|Head of Augustus]] as [[Pontifex Maximus]], Roman artwork of the late Augustan period, last decade of the 1st century BC]]\nAugustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 60\">Eck (2003), 60.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 61\">Eck (2003), 61.</ref> Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 117\">Eck (2003), 117.</ref>\n\n=== Conspiracy ===\n[[File:Augustus MAN Napoli Inv6040.jpg|thumb|left|A colossal statue of Augustus from the [[Sodales Augustales|Augusteum]] of [[Herculaneum]], seated and wearing a [[laurel wreath]].]]\nMany of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus's greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus's participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].</ref>\n\nLikewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply \"by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''\", and ended the crisis almost immediately.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /> It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.<ref name=\"eck 78\">Eck (2003), 78.</ref>\n\nThere were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\"/> Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.<ref>Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483</ref> [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]], the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair, was named among the conspirators. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.<ref>Wells, p. 53; Holland, p. 301</ref> All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured\u2014without ever giving testimony in their defence.<ref>Davies, p. 260; Holland, p. 301</ref> Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.<ref>Holland, p. 301</ref>\n\nIn 19&nbsp;BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\" /> In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,<ref name=\"eck 60\" /> as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\">Gruen (2005), 43.</ref> This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12&nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion.<ref>Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/2*.html#10 10.2]. Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#27.2 27.2] reports this under 13&nbsp;BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).</ref><ref name=\"ccaa 28\">Eder (2005), 28.</ref> On 5 February 2&nbsp;BC, Augustus was also given the title ''[[pater patriae]]'', or \"father of the country\".<ref>Mackay (2004), 186.</ref><ref name=\"eck 129\">Eck (2003), 129.</ref>\n\n=== Stability and staying power ===\nA final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life.<ref>[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#81 81].</ref> If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.<ref>Syme (1939), 337\u2013338.</ref> Augustus's accumulation of powers were now complete.

The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional [[constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]].

Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.<ref name=\"Southern, p. 108\" /> Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy&nbsp;\u2013 accusations that had already played out.<ref name=\"Stern, Gaius p. 23\" />\n[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding a scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)]]\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness.

The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" />\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 17}, {"title": " Additional powers ", "paragraphs": "During the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.<ref name=\"eck 57\" /> For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', the immunity given to a [[Tribune of the Plebs]].

However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster.

Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.<ref name=\"eck 60\">Eck (2003), 60.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 61\">Eck (2003), 61.</ref> Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"eck 117\">Eck (2003), 117.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 18}, {"title": " Conspiracy ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Augustus MAN Napoli Inv6040.jpg|thumb|left|A colossal statue of Augustus from the [[Sodales Augustales|Augusteum]] of [[Herculaneum]], seated and wearing a [[laurel wreath]].]]\nMany of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus's greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus's participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.<ref>Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].</ref>\n\nLikewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22&nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply \"by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''\", and ended the crisis almost immediately.<ref name=\"ccaa 26\" /> It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.<ref name=\"eck 78\">Eck (2003), 78.</ref>\n\nThere were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.<ref name=\"Southern p. 109\"/> Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.<ref>Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483</ref> [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]], the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair, was named among the conspirators.

Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\" /> In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,<ref name=\"eck 60\" /> as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.<ref name=\"ccaa 43\">Gruen (2005), 43.</ref> This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary.

Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate.

To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.

This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus's authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref name=\"ccaa 44\">Gruen (2005), 44.</ref><ref name=\"eck 58\">Eck (2003), 58.</ref> This granting of power showed Augustus's favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.<ref name=\"eck 58\" />\n[[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]]\n\nAugustus's intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children.<ref>Syme (1939), 416\u2013417.</ref> He took the consulship in 5 and 2&nbsp;BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers,<ref>Scullard (1982), 217.</ref> and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.<ref>Syme (1939), 417.</ref> Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus.

Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''Caesar'' became the word for ''Emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]'' (sometimes Csar or Czar). The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4].</ref> Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.<ref name=\"eck 1 2\">Eck (2003), 1\u20132</ref> The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the \"queen of inscriptions\" by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]].<ref name=\"eck 2\">Eck (2003), 2.</ref>\n\nThe ''Res Gestae'' is the only work to have survived from antiquity, though Augustus is also known to have composed poems entitled ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and a written rebuttal to Brutus's ''Eulogy of Cato''.<ref name=\"bunson 47\">Bunson (1994), 47.</ref> Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus, preserved in other works, to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.<ref name=\"shaw-smith 213\">Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.</ref><ref>Bourne (1918), 53\u201366.</ref>\n\nMany consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to \"[[Felicior Augusto, melior Traiano|be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan]]\". Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.<ref name=\"eck 79\" />\n\nA ''[[praefectus vigilum]]'', or \"Prefect of the Watch\" was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police.<ref name=\"bunson 345\">Bunson (1994), 345.</ref> With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"eck 85 86\">Eck (2003), 85\u201387.</ref> This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.<ref name=\"eck 86\">Eck (2003), 86.</ref>\n\nWith his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''.<ref name=\"eck 81\" /> Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.<ref name=\"chisholm 122\">Chisholm (1981), 122.</ref> In the year 6 Augustus established the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.<ref name=\"bunson 6\">Bunson (1994), 6.</ref>\n\nOne of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27&nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.<ref name=\"bunson 341\">Bunson (1994), 341.</ref> They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]].<ref name=\"bunson 341 342\">Bunson (1994), 341\u2013342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]]]]\nAlthough the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29&nbsp;BC, Augustus gave 400 sesterces (equal to 1/10 of a Roman pound of gold) each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" /> He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]] of deities.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\">Eder (2005), 23.</ref> In 28&nbsp;BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.<ref name=\"ccaa 23\" />\n\n[[File:KujulaKadphisesCoinAugustusImitation.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the style of Roman emperor Augustus.

As [[Tacitus]] wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.<ref>Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]</ref> Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus's own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus's ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.<ref name=\"eck 124\" /> The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.<ref name=\"kelsall 120\">Kelsall (1976), 120.</ref>\n\nHowever, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56\u2013c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus's death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.<ref name=\"starr 5\">Starr (1952), 5.</ref> Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:\n\n{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war\u2014and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used\u2014merely to preserve peace for the majority.<ref>Tacitus, The Annals, I 9</ref>}}\n[[File:Augustus Bronze X23322 NAMAthens.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]\n[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Virgil]] reading the [[Aeneid]] to Augustus and Octavia'', by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787]]\nAccording to the second opposing opinion:\n{{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts.

The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity.

In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]] (1658\u20131741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599\u20131658).<ref name=\"kelsall 118\">Kelsall (1976), 118.</ref> Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] (1689\u20131755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.<ref name=\"kelsall 119\">Kelsall (1976), 119.</ref> In his ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]] (1701\u20131757) deemed Augustus a [[Machiavelli]]an ruler, \"a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper\", \"wicked and worthless\", \"a mean spirit\", and a \"tyrant\".<ref name=\"kelsall 119\" />\n\n=== Revenue reforms ===\n[[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Augustus found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard, from an [[ancient Tamil country]], [[Pandyan Kingdom]] of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] in India, a testimony to [[Indo-Roman trade]].

Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus's predecessors had done.
