The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[Epirus]] trade), and its consequent aversion to [[Corcyra]] (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the [[Battle of Sybota]], which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]).{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}\n\nAmbraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[Amphilochians]] and [[Acarnanians]].  Hence it took a prominent part in the [[Peloponnesian War]] until the crushing defeat at [[Battle of Idomene|Idomene]] (426), which crippled its resources.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}\n\nIn the 4th century BC it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. With the assistance of Corinth and Athens, it escaped complete domination at Philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a Macedonian garrison.<ref name=\"OCD\"/>  In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given by the son of [[Cassander]] to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  In the wars of [[Philip V of Macedon]] and the Epirotes against the [[Aetolian League]] (220\u2013205) Ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  During the struggle of the Aetolians against [[Roman Republic|Rome]], it stood a stubborn [[siege]],{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} including the first known use of [[poison gas]] against the Romans' [[Tunnel warfare|siege tunnels]].<ref>[[Polybius]] 21.28</ref>\n\nAmbracia was captured and plundered by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] in 189 BC, after which it was declared by Rome a \"free city\", and gradually fell into insignificance.<ref name=\"OCD\"/>{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}  The foundation by [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] of [[Nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.  In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times a new settlement took its place under the name of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]].
