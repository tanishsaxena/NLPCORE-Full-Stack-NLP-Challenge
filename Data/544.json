It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.<ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928120516/http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ |date=2008-09-28 }}</ref> The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social and economic rather than political or diplomatic themes.\n\nThe school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878\u20131956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886\u20131944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902\u20131985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919\u20131996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915\u20132012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921\u20131984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923\u20132009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924\u20132014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895\u20131988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929\u2013 ) and includes Jacques Revel,<ref>Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'\u00e9tudes'' (full professor); he served as president of the \u00c9cole from 1995 to 2004.</ref> and [[Philippe Ari\u00e8s]] (1914\u20131984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalit\u00e9s''.  The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945\u2013 ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.\n  \nThe main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' (\"Annals of Economic and Social History\"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices. Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee '' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986\u2013 ), devoted to quantitative history.</ref> However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.<ref>Georg G.

It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a \"second\" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. \nBraudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.\n\nWhile authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 4}, {"title": "''Mentalit\u00e9s''", "paragraphs": "Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)<ref>Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)</ref> looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].

Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch\u2014he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations (\"longue dur\u00e9e\") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalit\u00e9s'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalit\u00e9'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalit\u00e9'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalit\u00e9'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis.

It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue dur\u00e9e approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue dur\u00e9e. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions.

He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.\n\nChartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of \"practices,\" his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of \"materials,\" his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of \"places,\" his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "*[[\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]]\n*[[Historiography]]\n*[[Rural history]]\n*[[Nouvelle histoire]]\n*[[Social history]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 10}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 11}, {"title": "Further reading", "paragraphs": "===About the School===\n* Aurell i Cardona, Jaume. \"Autobiographical Texts as Historiographical Sources: Rereading Fernand Braudel and Annie Kriegel,\" ''Biography,'' Volume 29, Number 3, Summer 2006, pp.&nbsp;425\u2013445 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/biography/v029/29.3aurell.html in Project Muse]\n* Bintliff, John L.
