He also reigned as [[King of Jerusalem]] from his marriage to [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella I]] in 1197 to his death. He was the younger son of [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]], a nobleman in [[Poitou]]. After participating in a rebellion against [[Henry II of England]] in 1168, he went to the [[Holy Land]] and settled in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].\n\nHis marriage to [[Eschiva of Ibelin (died 1196)|Eschiva of Ibelin]] (whose father, [[Baldwin of Ibelin]] was an influential nobleman) strengthened his position in the kingdom. His younger brother, [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy]], married [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the sister of and heir to [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]]. Baldwin made Aimery [[Constable of Jerusalem]] around 1180. He was one of the commanders of the Christian army in the [[Battle of Hattin]], which ended with decisive defeat at the hands of the army of [[Saladin]], the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan of Egypt and Syria, on 4 July 1187.\n\nAimery supported his brother, Guy, even after Guy had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem according to most barons of the realm, because of the death of Sibylla and their two daughters. The new king of Jerusalem, [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry of Champagne]], arrested him for a short period. After his release, he retired to [[Jaffa]] which was the fief of his elder brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan, who had left the Holy Land.\n\nAfter Guy died in May 1194, his vassals in Cyprus elected Aimery as their lord. He accepted the suzerainty of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. With the emperor's authorization, Aimery was crowned King of Cyprus in September 1197. He soon married Henry of Champagne's widow, Isabella I of Jerusalem. He and his wife were crowned king and queen of Jerusalem in January 1198. He signed a truce with [[Al-Adil I]], the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, which secured the Christian possession of the coastline from [[Acre (city)|Acre]] to [[Antioch]]. His rule was a period of peace and stability in both of his realms.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "12th and 13th-century King of Jerusalem"}]},

lord.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=29}} Henry of Champagne demanded the right to be consulted about the succession in Cyprus, but the Cypriote noblemen ignored him.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}} Around the same time, Henry of Champagne replaced Aimery with [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]] as constable of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}}\n\nAimery realized that the treasury of Cyprus was almost empty, because his brother had granted most landed property in the island to his supporters, according to Ernoul.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}} He summoned his vassals to an assembly.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}} After emphasizing that each of them owned more land than he had, he persuaded them one by one \"either by force, or by friendship, or by agreement\" to surrender

set up Roman Catholic dioceses in Cyprus.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=29}} He also sent his representative, [[Rainier of Jebail]], to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], proposing that he would acknowledge the emperor's suzerainty, if the emperor sent a royal crown to him.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=85}} Aimery primarily wanted to secure the emperor's assistance against a potential [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] invasion of Cyprus,{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}} but he also wanted to strengthen his own legitimacy as king.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}} Rainier of Jebail swore

to take a golden [[sceptre]] to Aimery as a symbol of his right to rule Cyprus.{{sfn|Johnson|1969|p=119}}\n\n=== King of Cyprus ===\n\nHenry VI's two envoys landed in Cyprus in April or May 1196.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}} Aimery may have adopted the title of king around that time, because Pope Celestin styled him as king already in a letter in December 1196.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}}{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=528}} In the same month, the pope set up a [[Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Nicosia|Roman Catholic archdiocese in Nicosia]] with three [[suffragan

[[Conrad of Querfurt|Conrad]], [[Bishop of Hildesheim]], crowned Aimery king in [[Nicosia]] in September 1197.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=85}} Aimery did homage to the chancellor.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=85}} The noblemen who owned fiefs in both Cyprus and the Kingdom of Jerusalem wanted to bring about a reconciliation between Aimery and Henry of Champagne.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=525}} One of them, [[Baldwin of Beisan]], Constable of Cyprus, persuaded Henry of Champage to visit Cyprus in early 1197.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}}{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} The two kings made peace, agreeing that Aimery's three sons were to marry Henry's three daughters.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} Henry also renounced the debt that Aimery still owed to him for Cyprus and allowed Aimery to garrison his troops at Jaffa.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} Aimery sent [[Reynald Barlais]] to take possession of Jaffa.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} Aimery again used the title of Constable of Jerusalem in November 1197, which suggests that he had also recovered that office as a consequence of his treaty with Henry of Champagne.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}}\n\n=== King of two realms ===\n\nHenry of Champagne fell from the window of his palace and died in Acre on 10 September 1197.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=93}} The aristocratic, but impoverished [[Raoul of Saint Omer]] was one of the possible candidates to succeed him, but the grand masters of the military orders opposed him vehemently.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=93}} A few days later, [[Al-Adil I]], the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, occupied Jaffa.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=93}}\n\n[[File:Omfroi isabela.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young man

Wittelsbach]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]], who arrived to Acre on 20 September, was the first to propose that the crown should be offered to Aimery.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=94}} Since Aimery's first wife had died, he could marry the widowed Isabella I of Jerusalem, who was the queen.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=94}} Although [[Aimaro Monaco dei Corbizzi|Aymar]], [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], stated that the marriage would be uncanonical, [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre]], started negotiations with Aimery who accepted the offer.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=33}} The patriarch also withdrew his objections and crowned Aimery and Isabella king and queen in Tyre in January 1198.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=33}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Cypriot army fought for the Kingdom of Jerusalem during Aimery's rule, but otherwise he administered his two realms separately.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=33}} Even before his coronation, Aimery united his forces with the German crusaders who were under the command of [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant]] to launch a campaign against the Ayyubid troops.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=530}} They forced Al-Adil to withdraw and captured [[Beirut]] on 21 October.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=530}} He laid siege to [[Toron]], but he had to lift the siege on 2 February, because the German crusaders decided to return to the Holy Roman Empire after learning that Emperor Henry VI had died.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=530}}\n\nAimery was riding at Tyre when four German knights attacked him in March 1198.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=95\u201396}} His retainers rescued him and captured the four knights.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=96}} Aimery accused Raoul of Saint Omer of hiring the assailants and sentenced him to banishment without a trial by his peers.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=96}} At Raoul's demand, the case was submitted to the High Court of Jerusalem which held that Aimery had unlawfully banished Raoul.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=96}} Nevertheless, Raoul voluntarily left the kingdom and settled in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], because he knew that he had lost Aimery's goodwill.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=96}}\n\nAimery signed a truce with Al-Adil on 1 July 1198, securing the possession of the coast from Acre as far as to [[Antioch]] for the crusaders for five years and eight months.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=81}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=98}} The Byzantine Emperor, [[Alexios III Angelos]], did not abandon the idea of recovering Cyprus.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=608}} He promised that he would help a new crusade if [[Pope Innocent III]] excommunicated Aimery to enable a Byzantine invasion in 1201, but the pope refuted him, emphasizing that the Byzantines had lost their right to Cyprus when Richard I conquered the island in 1191.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=608}}\n\nAimery kept the peace with the Muslims, even when [[Reynald II of Dampierre]], who arrived at the head of 300 French crusaders demanded him to launch a campaign against the Muslims in early 1202.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=531}} After Aimery reminded him that more than 300 soldiers were needed to wage war against the Ayyubids, Reynald left the Kingdom of Jerusalem for the [[Principality of Antioch]].{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=531}} An Egyptian emir seized a fortress near Sidon and made plundering raids against the neighboring territory.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=531}} After Al-Adil failed to stop the emir, Aimery's fleet captured 20 Egyptian ships and he broke into Al-Adil's realm.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=531}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=102}} In retaliation, Al-Adil's son, [[Al-Mu'azzam Isa]] plundered the region of Acre.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=531}} In May 1204, the fleet of Aimery sack a small town at the Nile Delta in Egypt.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=102}}{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=86}} The envoys of Aimery and Al-Adil signed a new truce for six years in September 1204.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=103}}{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=86}} Al-Adil
