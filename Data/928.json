He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]] and [[statics]], including an explanation of the principle of the [[lever]]. He is credited with designing innovative [[machine]]s, such as his [[Archimedes' screw|screw pump]], [[block and tackle|compound pulleys]], and defensive war machines to protect his native [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] from invasion.\n\nArchimedes died during the [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] when he was killed by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. [[Cicero]] describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a [[sphere]] and a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries.\n\nUnlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from [[Alexandria]] read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until {{circa|530{{nbsp}}AD}} by [[Isidore of Miletus]] in [[Byzantine]] Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the [[Middle Ages]] were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the [[Renaissance]], while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Works, Archimedes |publisher=University of Oklahoma |url=https://galileo.ou.edu/exhibits/works-archimedes |accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Genius of Archimedes \u2013 23 Centuries of Influence on Mathematics, Science and Engineering: Proceedings of an International Conference held at Syracuse, Italy|date=June 8\u201310, 2010|series=History of Mechanism and Machine Science|volume=11|publisher=Springer|editor1=Paipetis, Stephanos A.|editor2=Ceccarelli, Marco|isbn=978-90-481-9091-1|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-9091-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archimedes&nbsp;\u2013 The Palimpsest |publisher=[[Walters Art Museum]] |url=http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html |accessdate=2007-10-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928102802/http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer"}]}, {"name": "Infobox scientist\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Archimedes of Syracuse"}, {"name": "native_name", "value": "\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2"}, {"name": "native_name_lang", "value": "Greek"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Domenico-Fetti Archimedes 1620.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "''Archimedes Thoughtful'' by [[Domenico Fetti]] (1620)"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "''Archimedes Thoughtful''<br />by [[Domenico Fetti]] (1620)"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{circa|287{{nbsp}}BC}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Syracuse, Sicily]], [[Magna Graecia]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{circa|212{{nbsp}}BC|lk=no}} (aged around 75)"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "Syracuse, Sicily, Magna Graecia"}, {"name": "field", "value": "{{hlist|[[Mathematics]]|[[Physics]]|[[Engineering]]|[[Astronomy]]|[[Invention]]}}"}, {"name": "known_for", "value": "{{hlist|[[Archimedes' principle]]|[[Archimedes' screw]]|[[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]]|[[lever]]s|[[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|infinitesimals]]|[[Neusis construction|Neuseis constructions]]<ref>{{cite journal| last= Knorr| first=Wilbur R. | title=Archimedes and the spirals: The heuristic background| journal=[[Historia Mathematica]] | year=1978| volume=5| issue=1|pages=43\u201375|quote=\"To be sure, Pappus does twice mention the theorem on the tangent to the spiral [IV, 36, 54].

According to the popular account given by [[Plutarch]], Archimedes was contemplating a [[mathematical diagram]] when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a {{nowrap|lesser-known}} account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items.

According to [[Vitruvius]], a [[votive crown]] for a temple had been made for [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero II of Syracuse]], who had supplied the pure [[gold]] to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some [[silver]] had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.<ref name=\"vitruvius\">{{cite book|title = ''De Architectura'', Book IX, paragraphs 9\u201312|author = [[Vitruvius]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/20239-h.htm|accessdate = 2018-12-26|date = 2006-12-31}}</ref> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its [[density]].\nWhile taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible,<ref>{{cite web|title = Incompressibility of Water|publisher =[[Harvard University]]|url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html|accessdate=2008-02-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317130651/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html| archivedate= 17 March 2008| url-status= live}}</ref> so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained.

The Greek writer [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the ''[[Syracusia]]'', which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The ''Syracusia'' is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casson|first=Lionel|authorlink=Lionel Casson|title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World|year=1971|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-03536-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsseamanshipi0000cass}}</ref> According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the [[Archimedes' screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a {{nowrap|low-lying}} body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by [[Vitruvius]] may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].<ref>{{cite web|title = ''Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World''|author=[[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]] |author2=[[John Peter Oleson|Oleson, John Peter]]| publisher = Technology and Culture Volume 44, Number 1, January 2003 (PDF)| url =http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/toc/tech44.1.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Archimedes' screw&nbsp;\u2013 Optimal Design|author=Rorres, Chris| publisher =Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url =http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Screw/optimal/optimal.html |accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>[[:File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated.gif|An animation of an Archimedes' screw]]</ref> The world's first seagoing [[steamboat|steamship]] with a [[propeller|screw propeller]] was the [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.<ref>{{cite web |title = SS Archimedes|publisher= wrecksite.eu |url = http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?636|accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref>\n\n===Claw of Archimedes===\nThe [[Claw of Archimedes]] is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse.

The experiment took place at the [[Skaramagas]] naval base outside [[Athens]]. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1&nbsp;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood {{nowrap|mock-up}} of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&nbsp;feet (50&nbsp;m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of [[bitumen|tar]] paint, which may have aided combustion.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Archimedes' Weapon| magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date = November 26, 1973| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908175,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}}\n\nIn October 2005 a group of students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&nbsp;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a {{nowrap|mock-up}} wooden ship at a range of around 100&nbsp;feet (30&nbsp;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in [[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its [[autoignition temperature]], which is around 300&nbsp;\u00b0C (570&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{cite web|title = How Wildfires Work|author= Bonsor, Kevin| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714174036/http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2007 | url-status= live|date= 2001-05-29}}</ref><ref>[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html Fuels and Chemicals&nbsp;\u2013 Auto Ignition Temperatures]</ref>\n\nWhen ''MythBusters'' broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of \"busted\" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. ''MythBusters'' also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.<ref name=\"death ray\">{{cite web|title = Archimedes Death Ray: Testing with MythBusters|publisher = MIT| url = http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010, ''MythBusters'' again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled \"President's Challenge\".

After the capture of Syracuse c. 212&nbsp;BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:\n\n{{Text and translation|''Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione.''|When Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth, when the Sun was in line.<ref>{{cite web|title = ''De re publica'' 1.xiv \u00a721|author= [[Cicero]]| publisher =thelatinlibrary.com|url = http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title =''De re publica'' Complete e-text in English from Gutenberg.org|author=[[Cicero]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988|accessdate=2007-09-18|date=2005-02-09}}</ref>}}\n\nThis is a description of a [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]]. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled {{nowrap|''[[On Sphere-Making]]''}}.

According to [[Vitruvius]], a [[votive crown]] for a temple had been made for [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero II of Syracuse]], who had supplied the pure [[gold]] to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some [[silver]] had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.<ref name=\"vitruvius\">{{cite book|title = ''De Architectura'', Book IX, paragraphs 9\u201312|author = [[Vitruvius]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/20239-h.htm|accessdate = 2018-12-26|date = 2006-12-31}}</ref> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its [[density]].\nWhile taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible,<ref>{{cite web|title = Incompressibility of Water|publisher =[[Harvard University]]|url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html|accessdate=2008-02-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317130651/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html| archivedate= 17 March 2008| url-status= live}}</ref> so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying \"[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!\" ({{lang-el|\"\u03b5\u1f55\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1}}, ''he\u00far\u0113ka''!\", meaning \"I have found [it]!\").<ref name=\"vitruvius\" /> The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.<ref>{{cite web|title = Buoyancy|author= [[HyperPhysics]]| publisher =[[Georgia State University]]|url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/pbuoy.html|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714113647/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pbuoy.html#c1| archivedate= 14 July 2007| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes.

Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the [[Archimedes' screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a {{nowrap|low-lying}} body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain.

After the capture of Syracuse c. 212&nbsp;BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:\n\n{{Text and translation|''Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione.''|When Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth, when the Sun was in line.<ref>{{cite web|title = ''De re publica'' 1.xiv \u00a721|author= [[Cicero]]| publisher =thelatinlibrary.com|url = http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title =''De re publica'' Complete e-text in English from Gutenberg.org|author=[[Cicero]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988|accessdate=2007-09-18|date=2005-02-09}}</ref>}}\n\nThis is a description of a [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]].

Through proof by contradiction ([[reductio ad absurdum]]), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and he employed it to approximate the value of \u03c0. In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'' he did this by drawing a larger [[regular hexagon]] outside a [[circle]] and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of \u03c0 lay between 3{{sfrac|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and 3{{sfrac|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416.<ref>{{cite web|title =Archimedes on measuring the circle|author= Heath, T.L.| publisher =math.ubc.ca| url =http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/archimedes/circle.html|accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> He also proved that the [[area of a circle]] was equal to \u03c0 multiplied by the [[square]] of the [[radius]] of the circle (\u03c0r<sup>2</sup>).

The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused [[John Wallis]] to remark that he was: \"as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.\"<ref>Quoted in Heath, T.L.

This proof uses a variation of the series {{nowrap|[[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]]}} which sums to {{sfrac|1|3}}.\n\nIn ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: \"There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]]), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.\" To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the [[myriad]].

In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an [[Approximations of \u03c0|approximation]] of the value of pi ({{pi}}), showing that it is greater than {{sfrac|223|71}} and less than {{sfrac|22|7}}.\n* ''[[On Spirals]]''\n:This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [[Archimedean spiral]]. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [[angular velocity]].

The volume is {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>3</sup> for the sphere, and 2{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>3</sup> for the cylinder. The surface area is 4{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>2</sup> for the sphere, and 6{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>2</sup> for the cylinder (including its two bases), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere and cylinder.

In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [[cross section (geometry)|sections]] of [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], spheres, and paraboloids.\n* ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' (two volumes)\n:In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [[Eratosthenes]] that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap|self-gravitating}}, since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.\n\n:In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float.

It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of [[Conon of Samos]]. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an [[Approximations of \u03c0|approximation]] of the value of pi ({{pi}}), showing that it is greater than {{sfrac|223|71}} and less than {{sfrac|22|7}}.\n* ''[[On Spirals]]''\n:This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [[Archimedean spiral]]. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [[angular velocity]]. Equivalently, in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] ({{math|''r''}}, {{math|\u03b8}}) it can be described by the equation\n::<math>\\, r=a+b\\theta</math>\n:with [[real number]]s {{math|a}} and {{math|b}}. This is an early example of a [[Curve|mechanical curve]] (a curve traced by a moving [[point (geometry)|point]]) considered by a Greek mathematician.\n* ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder|On the Sphere and the Cylinder]]'' (two volumes)\n[[File:Esfera Arqu\u00edmedes.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases. A [[sphere]] and [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request. (see also: [[Equiareal map]])]]\n:In this treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a [[sphere]] and a [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and [[diameter]]. The volume is {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>3</sup> for the sphere, and 2{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>3</sup> for the cylinder. The surface area is 4{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>2</sup> for the sphere, and 6{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}<sup>2</sup> for the cylinder (including its two bases), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere and cylinder. The sphere has a volume {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the circumscribed cylinder. Similarly, the sphere has an area  {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the cylinder (including the bases). A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.\n* ''[[On Conoids and Spheroids]]''\n:This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [[cross section (geometry)|sections]] of [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], spheres, and paraboloids.\n* ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' (two volumes)\n:In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [[Eratosthenes]] that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap|self-gravitating}}, since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.\n\n:In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float. [[Archimedes' principle]] of buoyancy is given in the work, stated as follows: {{quote|Any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in sense to, the weight of the fluid displaced.}}\n* ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''\n:In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a [[triangle]] with equal base and height. He achieves this by calculating the value of a [[geometric series]] that sums to infinity with the [[ratio]] {{sfrac|1|4}}.\n[[File:Stomachion.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Ostomachion|Stomachion]]'' is a [[dissection puzzle]] in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]].]]\n* ''[[Ostomachion|(O)stomachion]]''\n:This is a [[dissection puzzle]] similar to a [[Tangram]], and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [[square]]. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of [[Stanford University]] in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square.

It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the [[The Cattle of Helios|Herd of the Sun]] by solving a number of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be [[square number]]s. This version of the problem was first solved by A.

This book mentions the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System|solar system]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]], as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the [[myriad]], Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8{{e|63}} in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias.

In this work Archimedes uses [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|infinitesimals]], and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the [[method of exhaustion]] to derive the results.

In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] visited [[Constantinople]] and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered that it was a [[palimpsest]], a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as [[vellum]] was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Reading Between the Lines|author= Miller, Mary K.| magazine= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=March 2007| url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/archimedes.html| accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s.
