The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black & Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily [[South Asians|East Indian]] and other Asian). Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of [[Asians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] make up the remainder of the population.\n\nAn increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom ([[Antiguan British|Antiguan Britons]]), United States and [[Canada]]. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and [[Jamaica]], and, increasingly, from the Dominican Republic, [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]]. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\nEnglish is the official language. The [[Barbuda]]n accent is slightly different from the [[Antigua]]n.\n\nIn the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.\n\nMany of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: \"Ent it?\" meaning \"Ain't it?\" which is itself dialectal and means \"Isn't it?\". Common island [[proverb]]s can often be traced to Africa.\n\nSpanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.<ref>Farquhar, Bernadette, [http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html \"The Spanish Language in Antigua and Barbuda: Implications for Language Planning and Language Research\"<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015910/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html |date=15 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Stjohnscathedralantigua.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, St. John's]]]]\n\nA majority (77%)<ref name=Factbook /> of Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglicans]] (17.6%) being the largest single denomination.
