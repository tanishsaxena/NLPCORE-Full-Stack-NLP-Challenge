The length of growing seasons and period in which they take place vary according to geographical location, and may not correspond to the four traditional seasonal divisions of the year. With respect to the traditional seasons annual plants are generally categorized into summer annuals and winter annuals. Summer annuals germinate during spring or early summer and mature by autumn of the same year. Winter annuals germinate during the autumn and mature during the spring or summer of the following calendar year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/files/line_drawings.htm|title=Definitions of Botanical Terminology|website=Illinoiswildflowers.info|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne seed-to-seed life cycle for an annual can occur in as little as a month in some species, though most last several months. [[Brassica rapa|Oilseed rapa]] can go from seed-to-seed in about five weeks under a bank of [[fluorescent lamp]]s. This style of growing is often used in classrooms for education. Many desert annuals are [[therophyte]]s,<ref name=\"introduction_to_world_vegetation\">{{Cite book  | last1 = Collinson | first1 = A.

Winter annuals die after flowering and setting seed. The seeds germinate in the autumn or winter when the soil temperature is cool.\n\nWinter annuals typically grow low to the ground, where they are usually sheltered from the coldest nights by snow cover, and make use of warm periods in winter for growth when the snow melts. Some common winter annuals include [[Lamium amplexicaule|henbit]], [[deadnettle]], [[chickweed]], and [[winter cress]].\n\nWinter annuals are important ecologically, as they provide vegetative cover that prevents soil erosion during winter and early spring when no other cover exists and they provide fresh vegetation for animals and birds that feed on them. Although they are often considered to be weeds in gardens, this viewpoint is not always necessary, as most of them die when the soil temperature warms up again in early to late spring when other plants are still dormant and have not yet leafed out.\n\nEven though they do not compete directly with cultivated plants, sometimes winter annuals are considered a pest in commercial agriculture, because they can be hosts for insect pests or fungal diseases (ovary smut \u2013 Microbotryum sp) which attack crops being cultivated.  The property that they prevent the soil from drying out can also be problematic for commercial agriculture.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Winter annuals"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Molecular genetics", "paragraphs": "In 2008, it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to the conversion into a [[perennial plant]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18997783|year=2008|last1=Melzer|first1=S|last2=Lens|first2=F|last3=Gennen|first3=J|last4=Vanneste|first4=S|last5=Rohde|first5=A|last6=Beeckman|first6=T|title=Flowering-time genes modulate meristem determinacy and growth form in Arabidopsis thaliana|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1489\u201392|doi=10.1038/ng.253|journal=Nature Genetics|url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/456722}}</ref> Researchers deactivated the SOC1 and FUL genes in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', which control flowering time.
