Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\" /> In 802, a Jew named Isaac accompanied the ambassador of [[Charlemagne]] to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Aachen Minster (today's cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called Aish, or Ash (\u05d0\u05e9).\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the

Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\" /> In 802, a Jew named Isaac accompanied the ambassador of [[Charlemagne]] to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Aachen Minster (today's cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called Aish, or Ash (\u05d0\u05e9).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "further", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Battle of Aachen"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Holborn"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1982b"}, {"name": "p", "value": "614"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Friedrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/firebombingofger00frie/page/117 117]"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stanton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "76"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stanton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "51"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stanton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "50"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stanton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "109"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stanton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "105"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Baker"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "p", "value": "37"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": "World War II", "paragraphs": "{{further|Battle of Aachen}}\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930, along with the rest of German territory west of the Rhine.<ref name=\"AAE\" /> Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated [[Rhenish Republic]].

During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Aachen Minster (today's cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen.

structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]].

While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.\n\nAlong the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[D\u00fcren]] earthquake<ref name=\"duerenEQ\">{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.</ref> and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],<ref name=\"Roermond\">{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.</ref> which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Anderson"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Ernest Masson"}, {"name": "editor1-last", "value": "Healy"}, {"name": "editor1-first", "value": "David"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2012"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "367"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "367"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Geological Society of London"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "1-86239-347-8"}, {"name": "issn", "value": "0305-8719"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}]}], "id": 15}, {"title": " Demographics ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]]\n\nAachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.<ref name=\"Zensus 2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen |title=Bev\u00f6lkerung im Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln |accessdate=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408003047/https://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}.</ref> At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population.<ref name=\"StatJahrbuch2009\">{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}.</ref> A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]].<ref>{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013a}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral.

There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.\n\n[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium in 1628.
