The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.\n</blockquote>\nThe account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called [[Giml\u00e9]] that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:\n<blockquote>It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[V\u00eddbl\u00e1in]] [''V\u00eddbl\u00e1inn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.</blockquote>\nIt is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to \u00c1lfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbl\u00e1in (''Vindbl\u00e1inn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of V\u00eddbl\u00e1in.\n\nModern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that \u00c1lfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Svart\u00e1lfaheimr"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "* [[Fairyland]]\n* [[Svart\u00e1lfar | Svart\u00e1lfar (black elves)]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "*''[[Wikisource:Prose Edda/Gylfaginning]] (The Fooling Of Gylfe)'' by Sturluson, Snorri, 13th century Edda, in English.
