The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to [[Margaret of England]] in 1251, [[Henry III of England]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_iii/ \"Alexander III, King of Scots 1249 \u2013 1286\", Scotland's History, BBC]</ref>\n\nOn attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short.<ref name=bbc/> He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships. The [[Battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Western Isles]] to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] until 1469 when they became a dowry for [[James III of Scotland|James III]]'s bride, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "fact", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2018"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Succession", "paragraphs": "\nAlexander had married [[Margaret of England|Margaret]], daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on 25 December 1251, when he was ten years old and she was eleven.<ref name=\"MacArthur2017\">{{cite book|author=Margaret MacArthur|title=History of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c8sDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT25|date=12 July 2017|publisher=Merkaba Press via PublishDrive|pages=25\u2013|id=PKEY:6610000020409}}</ref> She died in 1275, after they had had three children.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n:\n# [[Margaret of Scotland (Queen of Norway)|Margaret]] (28 February 1261 \u2013 9 April 1283), who married King [[Eric II of Norway]]<ref name=bbc/>\n# [[Alexander, Prince of Scotland]] (21 January 1264 [[Jedburgh]] \u2013 28 January 1284 [[Lindores Abbey]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]\n# David (20 March 1272 \u2013 June 1281 [[Stirling Castle]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]\n\nAccording to the [[Lanercost Chronicle]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: \"he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Herbert, ed.|title=Chronicle of Lanercost|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|date=1909|volume=6|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBNAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=he+used+never+to+forbear+on+account+of+season+nor+storm,+nor+for+perils+of+flood+or+rocky+cliffs,+but+would+visit+none+too+creditably+nuns+or+matrons,+virgins+or+widows+as+the+fancy+seized+him,+sometimes+in+disguise&source=bl&ots=yEItYRMs7g&sig=yz0Vs_BdYFi0hwh3YKOzFPyDQDM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9mPKzybLOAhWIRiYKHWgqAm4Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=he%20used%20never%20to%20forbear%20on%20account%20of%20season%20nor%20storm%2C%20nor%20for%20perils%20of%20flood%20or%20rocky%20cliffs%2C%20but%20would%20visit%20none%20too%20creditably%20nuns%20or%20matrons%2C%20virgins%20or%20widows%20as%20the%20fancy%20seized%20him%2C%20sometimes%20in%20disguise&f=false|accessdate=8 Aug 2016}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance.

It includes depictions of Alexander III's death as \"falling off a cliff\" with sorcery as the cause.\n*''Insurrection'' (2010) by [[Robyn Young]]. This novel is the first of a series of novels primarily about the life and times of Robert the Bruce. However, it covers Alexander III and the circumstances surrounding his death in some detail.<ref>{{cite web| title=Insurrection | author=http://historicalnovelsociety.org| work=historicalnovelsociety.org | url=http://historicalnovelsociety.org/reviews/insurrection/}}</ref>\n*[[Raphael Holinshed]], in his oft-fanciful history of England in his [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']], stated that at Alexander III's wedding, a horrible monster, mostly skeleton but with raw flesh, appeared at the end of the procession and caused the wedding to be hurriedly concluded. This was, in tradition, an omen of death.\n*''Crusader'' (1991) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. This novel follows the minority of Alexander III and his relationship with David de Lindsay. Tranter, who has written scores of historical novels spanning the range of Scotland's history, also wrote \"Envoy Extraordinary\" (1999) (about Patrick Earl of Dunbar) and \"True Thomas\" (1981) (about Thomas the Rhymer), both of which take place during the reign of Alexander III, and in which Alexander is a featured character.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Insurrection"}, {"name": "author", "value": "http://historicalnovelsociety.org"}, {"name": "work", "value": "historicalnovelsociety.org"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://historicalnovelsociety.org/reviews/insurrection/"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Ancestry", "paragraphs": "{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
