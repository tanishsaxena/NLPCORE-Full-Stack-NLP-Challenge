There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently. The [[Eburones]] were ruled by Ambiorix and [[Catuvolcus]]. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their [[harvest]], which had not been good that year. Understandably the [[starving]] Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that [[Military camp|camps]] be built near the Eburones' villages. Each [[centurion]] was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[soldiers]]. This created resentment among the Eburones.\n\nAlthough [[Julius Caesar]] had freed him from paying tribute to the [[Atuatuci]], Ambiorix joined [[Catuvolcus]] in the winter of 54 BC in an uprising against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] forces under [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus|Q. Titurius Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta|L. Aurunculeius Cotta]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Resisting the Romans", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Ambiorix's revolt}}\n[[Image:Li\u00e8ge, Palais Provincial, \u00e9pisodes des guerres d'Ambiorix.JPG|thumb|Ambiorix attacking Roman soldiers, relief at the Li\u00e8ge Provincial Palace]]\nBecause a drought had disrupted his grain supply, Caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious Belgic tribes. Roman troops led by Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta were wintering among the Eburones when they were attacked by them, led by Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Ambiorix deceived the Romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as a large Germanic force was preparing to cross the Rhine. Trusting Ambiorix, Sabinus and Cotta's troops left the next morning. A short distance from their camp, the Roman troops were ambushed by the Eburones and massacred.\n\nElsewhere, another Roman force under [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Q. Tullius Cicero]], brother of the orator [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Marcus]], were wintering amongst the Nervii. Leading a coalition of rebellious Belgic tribes, Ambiorix surrounded Cicero's camp. After a long while, a Roman messenger was finally able to slip through the Belgic lines and get word of the uprising to Caesar. Mobilizing his legions, Caesar immediately marched to Cicero's aid. As they approached the besieged Roman camp, the Belgae moved to engage Caesar's troops. Vastly outnumbered, Caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the Belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the Romans. Caesar's forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the Belgae to flight. Later, Caesar's troops entered Cicero's camp to find most of the men wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Indutiomarus]], a leader of the Treveri, began to harass Labienus's camp daily, eventually provoking Labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill Indutiomarus. They did so, and routed the remnants of Indutiomarus's army. Caesar personally remained in Gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed Gallic threat.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ambiorix's revolt"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Caesar's revenge", "paragraphs": "When the [[Roman senate]] heard what had happened, Caesar swore to destroy all the Belgic tribes.

The Roman campaigns against the Belgae took a few years, but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event. According to the writer [[Florus]], Ambiorix and his men succeeded in escaping across the [[Rhine]].<ref>[[Florus]], iii. 10. \u00a7 8</ref> They do not appear in Roman records after this point.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 3}, {"title": "Legacy", "paragraphs": "Caesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls, ''[[De Bello Gallico]]''.

When Belgium became independent in 1830 the national government{{Who|date=January 2015}} started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as [[national heroes]]. In Caesar's ''De Bello Gallico'', Ambiorix and his deeds were rediscovered. In 1841, the Belgian poet Joannes Nolet de Brauwere Van Steeland wrote a [[lyric poetry|lyric]]al [[epic poetry|epic]] about Ambiorix. Furthermore, on September 5, 1866, a statue of Ambiorix was erected on the main market square in [[Tongeren]], Belgium, referred to by Caesar as [[Atuatuca]], i.e. Atuatuca Tungrorum.\n\nToday, Ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in [[Belgium|Belgian]] history. Many companies, bars and [[friterie]]s have named themselves after him, and in many Belgian [[comics]] such as [[Suske en Wiske]] and [[Jommeke]] he plays a guest role.
