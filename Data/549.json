Gaud\u00ed made the first sketches in his workshop in the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]. He designed the house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating [[ruled surface|ruled geometry]] and naturalistic elements.\n\n[[File:Casa Mila-panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|The courtyard]]\nCasa Mil\u00e0 consists of two buildings, which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine stories: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main (or noble) floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Mil\u00e0s (a flat of all 1,323 m<sup>2</sup>), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical \"8\" because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof.\n\nOne of the most notable elements of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed out of brick covered with lime, [[trencad\u00eds|broken marble, or glass]] have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building.\n\nThe apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, as well as [[hydraulic tile]]s and various ornamental elements.\n\nThe stairways were intended as service entries, with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaud\u00ed added a prominent interior staircase. Gaud\u00ed wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only elevators on every other floor, so people on different floors would meet one another.\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:CasaMila-Balcons.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|CasaMila-Balcony, showing the self-supporting stone facade, also supported by curved iron beams]]\nCasa Mil\u00e0 is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of load-bearing walls. The facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes.<ref name=any2002a>[http://www.bcn.es/gaudi2002/catalan/obras/10com.htm Descripci\u00f3 casa Mil\u00e0] a \u00abany Gaud\u00ed\u00bb a l'Ajuntament de Barcelona</ref>\n\n=== Constructive and decorative items ===\n==== Facade ====\nThe facade is composed of large blocks of [[limestone]] from the [[Garraf Massif]] on the first floor and from the [[Villefranche-de-Conflent|Villefranche]] quarry for the higher levels. The blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model, then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them.\n\nViewed from the outside the building has three parts: the main body of the six-storey blocks with winding stone floors, two floors set a block back with a different curve, similar to waves,  a smoother texture and whiter color, and with small holes that look like [[embrasure]]s, and finally the body of the roof.<ref name=permanyer>[[#permanyer|Permanyer, 1996....p\u00e0g. 150-166]]</ref>\n\nGaud\u00ed's original facade had some of its lower-level ironwork removed. In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, and he eliminated the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, wrought ironwork had little importance. The ironwork was lost until a few years later, when Americans donated one of them to the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York|MoMa]], where it is on display.\n\nWith restoration initiatives launched in 1987, the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen. In order to respect the fidelity of the original, material was obtained from the Villefranche quarry, even though by then it was no longer operating.<ref Name=huertas/>\n\n==== Hall and courtyards ====\nThe building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark. Its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building. There are two patios on the side of the Passeig de Gracia and of the street Provence.\n\n;Patios\n[[File:Staircase - Patio of Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The patio]]\nPatios, structurally, are key as supporting loads of interior facades. The floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of [[cast iron]]. In the courtyard, there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but Gaud\u00ed applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams, like the spokes of a bicycle. They form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below, making the function of the central girder a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] and working in tension and compression simultaneously. This supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered \"the soul of the building\" with a clear resemblance to Gothic crypts. The centerpiece was built in a shipyard by [[Josep Maria Carandell]] who copied a steering wheel, interpreting Gaud\u00ed's intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life.\n\n;Interior, gates\n[[File:Front gate - Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Paintings cover the walls, with access protected by a giant iron gate]]\nAccess is protected by a massive [[iron]] gate with a design attributed to Jujol. It was originally used by both people and cars, as access to the garage is in the basement, now an [[auditorium]].\n\nThe two halls are fully polychrome with oil [[Mural paintings in the lobby of the Casa Mila|paintings]] on the plaster surfaces, with [[eclecticism|eclectic]] references to [[mythology]] and flowers.\n\nDuring construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars, the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time. The future neighbor Felix Anthony Meadows, owner of Industrial Linera, requested a change because his [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls Royce]] could not access it. Gaud\u00ed agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that Felix, who was establishing sales and factory in [[Walls of Valles]], could go to both places with his car from La Pedrera.<ref Name=huertas/>\n\nFor the floors of Casa Mil\u00e0, Gaud\u00ed used a model of [[floor]] forms of square timbers with two colors, and the [[hydraulic pavement]] hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the Batllo house. The wax was designed in gray by John Bertrand under the supervision of Gaud\u00ed who \"touched up with their own fingers,\" in the words of the manufacturer [[Josep Bay]].<ref name=bayo20>[[#bayo|Bassegoda, 2003....p\u00e0g. 20]]</ref>\n\n==== Loft ====\n[[File:Attic of Casa Mil\u00e0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The attic]]\nLike in [[Casa Batll\u00f3]], Gaud\u00ed shows the application of the [[catenary arch]] as a support structure for the roof, a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of [[Matar\u00f3]]'s cooperative known as \"L'Obrera Mataronense.\" In this case, Gaud\u00ed used the Catalan technique of [[Catalan vault|timbrel]], imported from [[Italy]] in the fourteenth century.\n\nThe attic, where the laundry rooms were located, was a clear room under a [[Catalan vault]] roof supported by 270 [[parabolic vault]]s of different heights and spaced by about 80&nbsp;cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.\n\nThe builder Bay\u00f3 explained its construction: \"First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. Then [[Josep Canaleta i Cuadras|Canaleta]] indicated the opening of each arch and Bay\u00f3 put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering, and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks.
