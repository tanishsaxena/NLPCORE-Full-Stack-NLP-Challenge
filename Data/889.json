Prior to Brahmagupta, zero was in use various forms but was regarded as a 'blank spot' (''sunya sthana'') in a positional number. It was only used by mathematicians (''ganakas''\u2014people doing calculations) while the general populace used the traditional [[Brahmi numerals]]. After 700, the decimal numbers with zero replaced the Brahmi numerals. The system was revolutionary by limiting the number of individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} \n\n[[File:Bakhshali numerals 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The numerals used in the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], dated to sometime between the 3rd and 7th century AD.]]\n[[File:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|Modern-day Arab telephone keypad with two forms of Arabic numerals: Western Arabic numerals on the left and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] on the right]]\n\nThe [[numeral system]] came to be known to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|court of Baghdad]], where mathematicians such as the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' ({{Lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0628\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a}}) was written about 825 in [[Arabic]], and the Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, ''On the Use of the Indian Numerals'' (''Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi'') about 830, propagated it in the Arab world.

Prior to Brahmagupta, zero was in use various forms but was regarded as a 'blank spot' (''sunya sthana'') in a positional number. It was only used by mathematicians (''ganakas''\u2014people doing calculations) while the general populace used the traditional [[Brahmi numerals]]. After 700, the decimal numbers with zero replaced the Brahmi numerals. The system was revolutionary by limiting the number of individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} \n\n[[File:Bakhshali numerals 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The numerals used in the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], dated to sometime between the 3rd and 7th century AD.]]\n[[File:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|Modern-day Arab telephone keypad with two forms of Arabic numerals: Western Arabic numerals on the left and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] on the right]]\n\nThe [[numeral system]] came to be known to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|court of Baghdad]], where mathematicians such as the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' ({{Lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0628\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a}}) was written about 825 in [[Arabic]], and the Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, ''On the Use of the Indian Numerals'' (''Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi'') about 830, propagated it in the Arab world.

Spanish scholars, because of the geographic proximity, trade, and constant warfare with the Muslim kingdoms of Southern Spain, saw a potential in the simplicity of Arabic numbers, and decided to adopt those symbols, and later other Europeans followed suit. There are two [[typographic]] styles for rendering European numerals, known as [[text figures|lining figures and text figures]].\n* The Arabic\u2013Indic or [[Eastern Arabic numerals]], used with the [[Arabic script]], developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]]. A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Persian and Urdu languages is shown below as East Arabic-Indic.\n* The [[Devanagari numerals]] used with [[Devanagari]] and related variants are grouped as [[Indian numerals]].\n\nThe evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown here in a table created by the French scholar [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla]] in his ''Histoire de la Mathematique'', which was published in 1757:\n\n[[File:EuropeanFormOfArabianDigits.png|frameless|upright=2.25|Table of numerals]]\n\n===Encoding===\n\nThe Arabic numerals 0\u20139 are encoded in [[ASCII]] at positions 0x30 to 0x39. [[Mask (computing)|Masking]] to the lower 4 binary bits (or taking the last [[hexadecimal]] digit) gives the value of the digit, a great help in converting text to numbers on early computers. These positions were inherited in [[Unicode]]<ref>https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf</ref> and in virtually all other encodings based in any way on ASCII. [[EBCDIC]] used different values, but also had the lower 4 bits equal to the digit value.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5.5em\"|Binary\n!style=\"width: 2.5em\"|Octal\n!style=\"width: 2.5em\"|Decimal\n!style=\"width: 2.5em\"|Hex\n!Glyph\n!Unicode\n!EBCDIC (Hex)\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0000\n|060\n|48\n|30\n|0||U+0030 DIGIT ZERO\n|F0\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0001\n|061\n|49\n|31\n|1||U+0031 DIGIT ONE\n|F1\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0010\n|062\n|50\n|32\n|2||U+0032 DIGIT TWO\n|F2\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0011\n|063\n|51\n|33\n|3||U+0033 DIGIT THREE\n|F3\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0100\n|064\n|52\n|34\n|4||U+0034 DIGIT FOUR\n|F4\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0101\n|065\n|53\n|35\n|5||U+0035 DIGIT FIVE\n|F5\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0110\n|066\n|54\n|36\n|6||U+0036 DIGIT SIX\n|F6\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0111\n|067\n|55\n|37\n|7||U+0037 DIGIT SEVEN\n|F7\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;1000\n|070\n|56\n|38\n|8||U+0038 DIGIT EIGHT\n|F8\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;1001\n|071\n|57\n|39\n|9||U+0039 DIGIT NINE\n|F9\n|}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Algorism"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Encoding", "paragraphs": "\nThe Arabic numerals 0\u20139 are encoded in [[ASCII]] at positions 0x30 to 0x39.
