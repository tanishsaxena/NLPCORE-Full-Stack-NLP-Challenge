Between c. 980 and 985 Aimoin wrote about St. Benedict in Abbey of Fleury-sur-Loire. <ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aimoin</ref>  His chief work is a ''Historia Francorum'', or ''Libri V. de Gestis Francorum'', which deals with the history of the [[Franks]] from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the [[Middle Ages]], but its historical value is now regarded as slight. It was edited by [[Georg Waitz|G. Waitz]] and published in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores'', Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826\u20131892).<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aimoin|volume=1|page=439}} Endote: See ''Histoire litt\u00e9raire de la France'', tome vii. (Paris, 1865\u20131869).</ref>\n\nIn 1004 he also wrote a ''Vita Abbonis, abbatis Floriacensis'', the last of a series of lives of the [[abbot]]s of Fleury, all of which, except the life of [[Abbo of Fleury|Abbo]], have been lost.  This was published by [[Jean Mabillon|J. Mabillon]] in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum|Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti]]'' (Paris, 1668\u20131701).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAimoin's third work was the composition of books ii and iii of the ''Miracula sancti Benedicti'', the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named '''Adrevald'''. This also appears in the ''Acta sanctorum''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "For", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the 9th-century monk and hagiographer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Aimoin of St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s"}]}, {"name": "lang-la", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Aimoinus (Annonius; Aemonius) Floriacensis"}]}, {"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "960"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1010"}]}, {"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "1"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Aimoin"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "page", "value": "439"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "External links", "paragraphs": "*[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/30_10_0950-1008-_Aimoinus_Floriacensis.html Opera Omnia by Migne Patrologia Latina with analytical indexs]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{EB1911 article with no significant updates}}\n[[Category:960s births]]\n[[Category:1010s deaths]]\n[[Category:French chroniclers]]\n[[Category:French Christian monks]]\n[[Category:11th-century historians]]\n[[Category:11th-century French writers]]\n[[Category:11th-century Latin writers]]", "attributes": [], "id": 2}]}
