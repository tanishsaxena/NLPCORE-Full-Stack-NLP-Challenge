Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at \u00a321 per passenger.\n\nOn 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]]. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force.<ref>''The Putnam Aeronautical Review'' edited by John Motum, p170 Volume one 1990 Naval Institute Press</ref>\n\nOther British competitors were quick to follow \u2013 [[Handley Page Transport]] was established in 1919 and used the company's converted [[World War One|wartime]] [[Handley Page Type O|Type O/400]] [[bomber]]s with a capacity for 12 passengers,<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1961/1961%20-%200055.PDF</ref> to run a [[London]]-[[Paris]] passenger service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/Airline%20History/History1903.asp|title=Airline History 1903 to 1919|website=www.airlinehistory.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\nThe first French airline was [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des lignes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]], later known as A\u00e9ropostale, which started its first service in late 1918 to Spain.

In its first year, the D.L.R. operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with a combined length of nearly 1000 miles. By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924. It operated joint-venture airlines in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]] made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world.

One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod.

In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far-flung parts of the [[British Empire]] and to enhance trade and integration.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1923/1923%20-%200760.html |title = Imperial Air Transport Company: Appointment of Government Directors|work = Flight|date = December 20, 1923|page = 760}}</ref>\n\nThe first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm</ref> In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.\n\nTwo French airlines also merged to form [[Air Union]] on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become [[Air France]], the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nGermany's [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]. Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Global expansion====\nIn 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|April 1935 map showing [[Imperial Airways]]' routes from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]]] Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, A\u00e9ropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged into [[Air France]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlthough Germany lacked colonies, it also began expanding its services globally.

The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.\n\nThere has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]]. Other national airlines, including Italy's [[Alitalia]], have suffered \u2013 particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/alitalia-future-hinges-on-rescue-package/a-1320328|title=Alitalia Future Hinges on Rescue Package {{!}} Business {{!}} DW {{!}} 07.09.2004|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. airline industry===\n{{main|Air transportation in the United States}}\n\n====Early development====\n[[File:TWA 1940.jpg|thumb|[[TWA]] [[Douglas DC-3]] in 1940.

Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]<ref>Amick, George. \"How The Airmail Got Off The Ground.\" American History 33.3 (1998): 48.

In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner.

Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]].

Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]].

New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid-off staff from other airlines.\n\nMajor airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.<ref name=\"Andrew R. Thomas\">{{cite news|url = http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/current-affairs/9781430236771 |title=Mr. Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|publisher=Apress |year=2007}}</ref> In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes, below the cost of operating on it, choking out any chance a start-up airline may have.

Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].\n\nBy the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.\n\nToward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called \"legacy airlines\", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world. What next?|date=2016-03-21|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}</ref> Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.\n\nIncreasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Among the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, [[Robert Crandall]] has publicly stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429202738/http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |archivedate=2013-04-29 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====The airline industry bailout====\n\nCongress passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926 Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Through the [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board|ATSB]] Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks.

Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at \u00a321 per passenger.\n\nOn 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]].

In its first year, the D.L.R. operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with a combined length of nearly 1000 miles. By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924. It operated joint-venture airlines in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]] made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world.

[[Junkers F.13]] D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and [[Tallinn]], capital of [[Estonia]], and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod.

The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Rationalization====\n[[File:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|The [[Imperial Airways]] Empire Terminal, Victoria, London. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]\nBy the early 1920s, small airlines were struggling to compete, and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation. In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far-flung parts of the [[British Empire]] and to enhance trade and integration.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1923/1923%20-%200760.html |title = Imperial Air Transport Company: Appointment of Government Directors|work = Flight|date = December 20, 1923|page = 760}}</ref>\n\nThe first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm</ref> In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.\n\nTwo French airlines also merged to form [[Air Union]] on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become [[Air France]], the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nGermany's [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]. Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Global expansion====\nIn 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|April 1935 map showing [[Imperial Airways]]' routes from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]]] Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, A\u00e9ropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged into [[Air France]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlthough Germany lacked colonies, it also began expanding its services globally.

During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====EU airline deregulation====\nDeregulation of the [[European Union]] airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant.

Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]<ref>Amick, George. \"How The Airmail Got Off The Ground.\" American History 33.3 (1998): 48. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Nov. 2011.</ref> aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army Air Service]].

Some of the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Braniff Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]].\n\nService during the early 1920s was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on [[airmail#History|carrying bags of mail]]. In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable.<ref>{{ cite web | url = https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/current/airmail-in-america/the-airplanes/the-ford-trimotor.html | title = The Ford Trimotor and Douglas M-2 Mail Planes | work = Postal Museum | accessdate = July 27, 2017 }}</ref> Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.\n\nAt the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]].

Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]].

The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.\n\nOn 4 October 1958, [[BOAC]] started [[transatlantic flight]]s between [[London Heathrow]] and [[New York-Idlewild Airport|New York Idlewild]] with a Comet 4, and [[Pan Am]] followed on 26 October with a B707 service between New York and Paris.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-how-the-jet-travel-era-began-in-earnest-449222/ |title= How the jet travel era began in earnest \u2013 60 years ago |date= 4 Oct 2018 |author= Max Kingsley Jones |work= Flightglobal}}</ref>\n\nThe next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated [[widebody]] (\"jumbo jet\") service, which is still the standard in international travel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-747-first-flight-47years-ago-2016-2|title=The Boeing 747 jumbo jet changed air travel with this momentous event 47 years ago|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}</ref> The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-cold-war-race-to-build-the-concorde|title=The Cold War Race to Build the Concorde|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>  Concorde first flew in 1969 and operated through 2003.

New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid-off staff from other airlines.\n\nMajor airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.<ref name=\"Andrew R. Thomas\">{{cite news|url = http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/current-affairs/9781430236771 |title=Mr. Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|publisher=Apress |year=2007}}</ref> In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes, below the cost of operating on it, choking out any chance a start-up airline may have. The industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asq.org/quality-report/10-year-analysis.html |website =American Society of Quality (ASQ)|title = The American Society for Quality Debuts Quarterly Quality Report with 10-Year Analysis}}</ref> Since deregulation in 1978 the average domestic ticket price has dropped by 40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/airlines/analysis/analysis_airline_industry.html |publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology|title = Airline Industry Overview}}</ref> So has airline employee pay.

Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].\n\nBy the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.\n\nToward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called \"legacy airlines\", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world. What next?|date=2016-03-21|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}</ref> Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.\n\nIncreasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Among the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, [[Robert Crandall]] has publicly stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429202738/http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |archivedate=2013-04-29 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====The airline industry bailout====\n\nCongress passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926 Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Through the [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board|ATSB]] Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks.

In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner.

Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]].

New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid-off staff from other airlines.\n\nMajor airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.<ref name=\"Andrew R.

Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].\n\nBy the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.\n\nToward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called \"legacy airlines\", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world.

However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.\n\nIncreasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region.

In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.\nThe entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms.

Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.\n\nBilateral agreements are based on the \"[[freedoms of the air]]\", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.\n\nIn the 1990s, \"[[open skies]]\" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Unreferenced", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "section"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}], "id": 15}, {"title": "National", "paragraphs": "[[File:British Airways (27078321943).jpg|thumb|[[Union Jack]] tails of [[British Airways]], UK's [[flag carrier]]]]\n\nMany countries have [[Flag carrier|national airline]]s that the government owns and operates.

Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.\nThe entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.<ref>\"Too Much of a Good Thing.\" ''The Economist'' 26 March 2016: 23. print.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}], "id": 16}, {"title": "International", "paragraphs": "{{Unreferenced|section|date=January 2020}}[[File:La Maison de l-OACI - 11a.jpg|thumb|[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] headquarters in [[Montreal]]]]\n\nGroups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.\n\nBilateral agreements are based on the \"[[freedoms of the air]]\", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.\n\nIn the 1990s, \"[[open skies]]\" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Unreferenced", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "section"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}], "id": 17}, {"title": "Economic considerations", "paragraphs": "\nIn 2017, 4.1 billion passengers have been carried by airlines in 41.9 million commercial scheduled flights (an average payload of {{#expr:4100/41.9round0}} passengers), for 7.75 trillion [[passenger kilometre]]s (an average trip of {{#expr:7750/4.100round0}} km) over 45,091 airline routes served globally.<!--<ref name=ATAGOct2018>--> In 2016, air transport generated $704.4 billion of revenue in 2016, employed 10.2 million workers, supported 65.5 million jobs and $2.7 trillion of economic activity: 3.6% of the global [[GDP]].<ref name=ATAGOct2018>{{cite web |url= https://www.aviationbenefits.org/media/166344/abbb18_full-report_web.pdf |publisher= Air Transport Action Group |title= Aviation: Benefits Beyond Borders |date= October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, the total weekly airline capacity was 181.1 billion [[Available Seat Kilometers]] (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://html5.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/desktop/stage/default.aspx?pnum=78&edid=e030c749-44c6-4ab0-af51-84e8f4424689 |title= Capacity snapshot |work= Airline Business |date= July\u2013August 2016 |publisher= Flight Global |page= 78}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top 150 airline groups<ref name=WorldAirlineRankings2017>{{cite web |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/18223 |title= World Airline Rankings |date= 2017 |work= Flight Global}}</ref>\n! !! 2016 !! 2015 !! 2014 !! 2013 !! 2012 !! 2011 !! 2010 !! 2009 !! 2008\n|-\n!

The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,1715861,00.html Wings of Desire], Guardian, Thursday February 23, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.johnkay.com/2005/09/27/airlines-and-the-canine-features-of-unprofitable-industries/ Airlines and the canine features of unprofitable industries], Financial Times, September 27, 2005</ref>\n\nOne argument is that [[positive externalities]], such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highway]]s and [[Rail transport|railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn December 1991, the collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nFollowing the [[Airline Deregulation Act|1978 deregulation]], U.S. carriers did not manage to make an aggregate [[economic profit|profit]] for 12 years in 31, including four years where combined [[economic loss|losses]] amounted to $10 billion, but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since 2010, including its four with over $10 billion profits.<!--<ref name=AvWeek14May2018/>--> They drop loss-making routes, avoid [[fare war]]s and [[market share]] battles, limit [[Seating capacity|capacity]] growth, add [[airline hub|hub]] feed with [[regional jet]]s to increase their [[profitability]].

[[Delta Air Lines]] was the largest by [[revenue]], [[asset]]s value and [[market capitalization]]. [[Lufthansa Group]] was the largest by number of [[employee]]s, [[FedEx Express]] by freight [[tonne-kilometres]], [[Turkish Airlines]] by number of countries served and [[UPS Airlines]] by number of destinations served<ref name=\":8\" /> (though [[United Airlines]] was the largest passenger airline by number of destinations served).<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n{{main|World's largest airlines}}\n\n===Ticket revenue===\n[[File:Diagram of an airline Global Distribution System.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram of an airline [[Global Distribution System]]]]\n\nAirlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nBecause of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMost airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (\"O&D control\"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term \"[[fare war]]\" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in \"legacy\" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nComputers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for \"no-shows\", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What\u2019s the world\u2019s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines\u2019 Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n==== Elasticity ====\n\nThe demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for [[business travel]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author=David W.

Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMoreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnalysis of the 1992\u20131996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2\u20133.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10\u201313%, handling companies 11\u201314%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%.

The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]\nAirline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000\u20132005 period.\n\nIn view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIf a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOther factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Airline partnerships===\n{{largest airline alliances}}\n\n[[Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]\u2013[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]\u2013[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Brussels]]\u2013[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nSince airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as \"show me flights from Chicago to D\u00fcsseldorf\"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago\u2013[[D\u00fcsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to D\u00fcsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. The largest are [[Star Alliance]], [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]], and these accounted for over 60% of global commercial air traffic {{As of|2015||df=|lc=y}}.<ref name=\":7\" /> Alliances of airlines coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets and often engage in extensive [[codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations\u2014sometimes including cross-equity arrangements\u2014in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.\n\nOften the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Fuel hedging===\n{{Main|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs.

The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nBecause of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMost airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (\"O&D control\"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term \"[[fare war]]\" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in \"legacy\" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nComputers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for \"no-shows\", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What\u2019s the world\u2019s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines\u2019 Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n==== Elasticity ====\n\nThe demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for [[business travel]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author=David W.

Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnalysis of the 1992\u20131996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales.

The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]\nAirline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000\u20132005 period.\n\nIn view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIf a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOther factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}], "id": 24}, {"title": "Airline partnerships", "paragraphs": "{{largest airline alliances}}\n\n[[Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]\u2013[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]\u2013[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Brussels]]\u2013[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nSince airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as \"show me flights from Chicago to D\u00fcsseldorf\"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago\u2013[[D\u00fcsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to D\u00fcsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. The largest are [[Star Alliance]], [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]], and these accounted for over 60% of global commercial air traffic {{As of|2015||df=|lc=y}}.<ref name=\":7\" /> Alliances of airlines coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets and often engage in extensive [[codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations\u2014sometimes including cross-equity arrangements\u2014in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.\n\nOften the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "As of", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "lc", "value": "y"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}], "id": 25}, {"title": "Fuel hedging", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs.

Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ [[lawyers]] to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklaw.com/practices/aviation-regulation/|title=Aviation Regulation|website=www.hklaw.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.hklaw.com/practices/aviation-regulation/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Aviation Regulation"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.hklaw.com"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2017-10-14"}]}], "id": 30}, {"title": "Industry trends", "paragraphs": "[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Map of scheduled airline traffic in 2009]]\n\nThe pattern of ownership has been privatized since the mid-1980s, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Government-owned and Privatized Airlines (unofficial preliminary compilation) |publisher = [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] |url = https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/PrivatizedAirlines.pdf|date = 4 July 2008}}</ref> Many major airlines operating between the 1940s and 1980s were government-owned or government-established. However, most airlines from the earliest days of air travel in the 1920s and 1930s were personal businesses.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGrowth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2\u20133% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. [[Warren Buffett]] in 1999 said \"the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett\u2019s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>\n\nAs in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s.<ref name=\":6\" /> Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n", "attributes":
