The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th Dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time.  Wahibre was 'Leader of the southern foreigners' and 'Head of the doors of foreigners', so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor, Udjahorresnet, began, who was of particular importance to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Several \"heads of the fleet\" are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers.\n\n[[File:Polykrates with Pharao Amasis II.jpg|thumb|[[Polycrates]], Tyrant of [[Samos]], with Pharaoh Amasis II.]]\n[[Herodotus]] describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by [[Cambyses II]] or [[Cyrus the Great]] for an Egyptian [[ophthalmologist]] on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.<ref name=Hero/>\n\nAmasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh [[Apries]], whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.<ref name=\"Hero\">{{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = The History of Herodotus Volume I,Book II| url = https://archive.org/details/historyherodotu00herogoog| year = 1737| publisher = D.

This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.<ref name=Hero/><ref name=Herodotus/>\n\nFirst, Cyrus the Great signed alliance agreements with the [[Lydia]]n King [[Croesus]] and [[Nabonidus]] the Babylonian king in 542 BC. The actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between Egypt and her allies. With both now deprived of Egyptian support, the Persians conquered, first, Croesus's empire in 541 BCE, and, then, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.\n\nHerodotus also describes how, just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], who would later leave Amasis, for reasons that Herodotus does not clearly know, but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his [[eunuch]]s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice for his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle of Pelusium]] in 525 BC.<ref name=Herodotus/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite encyclopedia ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Mason"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Charles Peter"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Charles Peter Mason"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Amasis (II)"}, {"name": "editor", "value": "[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]"}, {"name": "encyclopedia", "value": "[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "136\u2013137"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Little, Brown and Company]]"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Boston"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1867"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0145.html"}]}, {"name": "citation needed span", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2019"}, {"name": "text", "value": "He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh [[Psamtik II]] in 592 BC in [[Nubia]]."}]}, {"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Amasis"}, {"name": "display", "value": "Amasis s.v.
