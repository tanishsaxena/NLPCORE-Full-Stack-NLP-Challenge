Of these, the most important were the tax reforms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system (malikane) (see [[tax farming]]). Following the recovery of Belgrade under his predecessor, [[Suleiman II]], the military frontier reached a rough stalemate on the Danube, with the Habsburgs no longer able to advance south of it, and the Ottomans attempting, ultimately unsuccessfully, to regain the initiative north of it.\n\nAmong the most important features of Ahmed's reign was his reliance on [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha|K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha]]. Following his accession to the throne, Sultan Ahmed II confirmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha in his office as grand vizier. In office from 1689, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha was from the famous K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family of grand viziers, and like most of his K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc predecessors in the same office, was an able administrator and military commander. Like his father K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha (grand vizier 1656\u201361) before him, he ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself. He overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars. He also reformed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the Balkans and Anatolia. In October 1690 he recaptured Belgrade (northern Serbia), a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers Danube and Sava; in Ottoman hands since 1521, the fortress had been conquered by the Habsburgs in 1688.\n\nFaz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha's victory at Belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the Ottomans hope that the military debacles of the 1680s\u2014which had led to the loss of Hungary and Transylvania, an Ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro-Istanbul Hungarian princes\u2014 could be reversed. However, the Ottoman success proved ephemeral. On 19 August 1691, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha suffered a devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] (northwest of Belgrade) at the hands of Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden, the Habsburg commander in chief in Hungary, fittingly nicknamed \u201cT\u00fcrkenlouis\u201d (Louis the Turk) for his victories against the Ottomans. In the confrontation, recognized by contemporaries as \u201cthe bloodiest battle of the century,\u201d the Ottomans suffered heavy losses: 20,000 men, including the grand vizier. With him, the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family, who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the Ottoman military.\n\nUnder Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha's successors, the Ottomans suffered further defeats. In June 1692 the Habsburgs conquered V\u00e1rad (Oradea, Romania), the seat of an Ottoman governor ({{lang|tr|beylerbeyi}}) since 1660. In 1694 they attempted to recapture V\u00e1rad, but to no avail. On 12 January 1695, they surrendered the fortress of Gyula, the center of an Ottoman sanjak or subprovince since 1566. With the fall of Gyula, the only territory still in Ottoman hands in Hungary was to the east of the River Tisza and to the south of the river Maros, with its center at Temesv\u00e1r. Three weeks later, on 6 February 1695, Ahmed II died in [[Edirne Palace]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "unreferenced section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2016"}]}, {"name":
