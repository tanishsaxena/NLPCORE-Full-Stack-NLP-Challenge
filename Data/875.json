The surviving books of his history cover the years 353 to 378.{{sfn|Kagan|2009|p=23}}\n\nAmmianus served as a soldier in the army of [[Constantius II]] and [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] in Gaul and in the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]. He professes to have been \"a former soldier and a [[Greek people|Greek]]\" (''miles quondam et graecus''),{{sfn|Barnes|1998|p=65}} and his enrollment among the elite ''[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|protectores domestici]]'' (household guards) shows that he was of middle class or higher birth. Consensus is that Ammianus probably came from a curial family, but it is also possible that he was the son of a ''[[Diocese of the East|comes Orientis]]'' of the same family name. He entered the army at an early age, when Constantius II was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], governor of [[Nisibis]] in [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], and ''[[magister militum]]''.\n\n[[File:Diyarbakirwalls2.jpg|thumb|The walls of Amida, built by [[Constantius II]] before the [[Siege of Amida]] of 359. Ammianus himself was present in the city until a day before its fall.]]\nHe returned with Ursicinus to Italy when Ursicinus was recalled by Constantius to begin an expedition against [[Claudius Silvanus]]. Silvanus had been forced by the allegedly false accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in [[Gaul]]. Ammianus campaigned in the East twice under Ursicinus. On one occasion, he became separated from the officer's entourage and took refuge in [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] during the [[Siege of Amida|siege of the city]] by the Sassanids under King [[Shapur II]]; he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Kagan|2009|p=29-30}}\n\nWhen Ursicinus was dismissed from his military post by Constantius, Ammianus too seems to have retired from the military; however, reevaluation of his participation in [[Julian (emperor)|Julian's]] Persian campaigns has led modern scholarship to suggest that he continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history.\nHe accompanied Julian, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the [[Alamanni]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].\nAfter Julian's death, Ammianus accompanied the retreat of the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], as far as Antioch. \nHe was residing in Antioch in 372 when a certain [[Theodorus (usurper)|Theodorus]] was thought to have been identified the successor to the emperor [[Valens]] by divination. \nSpeaking as an alleged eyewitness, Marcellinus recounts how Theodorus and several others were made to confess their deceit through the use of torture, and cruelly punished.\n\n[[File:IVLIANVS.png|thumb|200 px|Portrait of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] on a bronze coin of [[Antioch]]]] \nHe eventually settled in Rome and began the ''Res Gestae''.

He presumably completed the work before 391, as at 22.16.12 he praises the [[Serapeum]] in Egypt as the glory of the empire; it was in that same year the Emperor granted the temple grounds to a Christian bishop, provoking pagans into barricading themselves in the temple, plundering its contents, and torturing Christians, ultimately destroying the temple.

It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary; like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the ''Res Gestae'' into question.\n\nHis work has suffered substantially from manuscript transmission. Aside from the loss of the first thirteen books, the remaining eighteen are in many places corrupt and [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]]. The sole surviving manuscript from which almost every other is derived is a ninth-century [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] text, Vatican lat. 1873 (''V''), produced in [[Fulda]] from an insular exemplar. The only independent textual source for Ammianus lies in Fragmenta Marbugensia (''M''), another ninth-century [[Franks|Frankish]] [[codex]] which was taken apart to provide covers for account-books during the fifteenth century. Only six leaves of ''M'' survive; however, before this manuscript was dismantled the Abbot of Hersfeld lent the manuscript to [[Sigismund Gelenius]], who used it in preparing the text of the second Froben edition (''G''). The dates and relationship of V and M were long disputed until 1936 when R. P. Robinson demonstrated persuasively that V was copied from M. As L. D. Reynolds summarizes, \"M is thus a fragment of the archetype; symptoms of an insular pre-archetype are evident.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|1983|p=6ff}}\n\nHis handling from his earliest printers was little better. The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was printed in 1474 in Rome by Georg Sachsel and Bartholomaeus Golsch, which broke off at the end of Book 26. The next edition (Bologna, 1517) suffered from its editor's  conjectures upon the poor text of the 1474 edition; the 1474 edition was pirated for the first Froben edition (Basle, 1518). It was not until 1533 that the last five books of Ammianus' history were put into print by Silvanus Otmar and edited by Mariangelus Accursius. The first modern edition was produced by C.U. Clark (Berlin, 1910\u20131913).{{sfn|Reynolds|1983|p=6ff}} The first English translations were by [[Philemon Holland]] in 1609,{{sfn|Jenkins|2017|p=31}} and later by [[Charles Duke Yonge|C.D.
