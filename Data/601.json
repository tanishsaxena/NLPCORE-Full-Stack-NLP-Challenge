Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was \"about thirty years old\" shortly after \"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.<ref>{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}</ref><ref>T\u00f8ndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''</ref><ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&pg=PA347 |last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|year=2009|pages=345-347}}</ref>\nIt has also been speculated by Georges Declercq<ref>Declercq, Georges, \"Anno Domini.

It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

In the ''History'' he also used the [[Latin]] phrase ''ante [...] incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' (\"in the sixtieth year before the time of the Lord's incarnation\"), which is equivalent to the English \"before Christ\", to identify years before the first year of this era.<ref>Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.</ref> Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of [[Jesus Christ]], but \"the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i. e., the Annunciation on March 25\" (\"Annunciation style\" dating).{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}\n\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City.

Bede used the expression ''\"anno [...] ante incarnationem Dominicam\"'' (in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice.

It was called \"Nativity style\" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages.

That second \"Annunciation style\" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.\n* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1).

This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', \"year of the world\" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]].
