This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.\n\nA pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it\u2014from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.\u2014was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol, between 1966 and 1977]]\n\nAs an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \"[[The Factory]]\", Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \"[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]\", including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some\u2014like Berlin\u2014remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and [[55th Street Playhouse]]) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.

The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 Coke Bottles'', and ''100 Dollar Bills''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno }}</ref>\n\nIt was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the [[Birmingham campaign]] in the [[civil rights movement]]. During these years, he founded his studio, \"[[The Factory]]\" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:\n\n{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.

Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.\n\nA pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it\u2014from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.\u2014was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol, between 1966 and 1977]]\n\nAs an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \"[[The Factory]]\", Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \"[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]\", including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some\u2014like Berlin\u2014remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and [[55th Street Playhouse]]) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.

Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.<ref>Smith, Patrick S (1986).

From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then \"elite supercar\" [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]].

Warhol used the same techniques\u2014silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors\u2014whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962\u201363 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych ''Silver Car Crash'', became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.<ref name=\"sothebys.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale |website=Sotheby's |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]].

He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or [[Ronnie Cutrone]], a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'.

In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> plus some 500 short black-and-white \"[[Screen Tests|screen test]]\" portraits of Factory visitors.<ref>Schaffner (1999), p. 73.</ref> One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours.

Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.<ref>{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol & Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an \"homage\" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.\n\nWarhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.

Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.\n\nHis most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that \"story\" while it was lowered for the other.

His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted.

Bowie recorded a song called \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy's Chest\", about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:\n\n{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film [''Basquiat''...] We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair.

Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}</ref>"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Bob"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Colacello"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Bob Colacello"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "HarperCollins"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "page", "value": "343"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-06-016419-0"}, {"name": "oclc", "value": "21196706"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-0-313-38056-3"}]}, {"name": "webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082251/http://www.warhol.org/education/resourceslessons/Jean-Michel-Basquiat/"}, {"name": "date", "value": "March 4, 2016"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Jane"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Dillenberger"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Religious Art of Andy Warhol"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Continuum"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "10\u201311"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-8264-1334-X"}, {"name": "oclc", "value": "59540326"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Warhol: Cars"}, {"name": "date", "value": "September 1, 2001"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "April 24, 2010"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The Guardian"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Maev"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Kennedy"}]}, {"name": "Cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13371502"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Andy Warhol self-portrait fetches $38.4m"}, {"name": "date", "value": "May 12, 2011"}, {"name": "newspaper", "value": "BBC News"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "January 30, 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "AP"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Warhol 'Elvis' sells for $37M;

Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display.

On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans\u2014Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |archivedate=August 1, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life.

From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.<ref>Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then \"elite supercar\" [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]].

The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych ''Silver Car Crash'', became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.<ref name=\"sothebys.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale |website=Sotheby's |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]].

In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> plus some 500 short black-and-white \"[[Screen Tests|screen test]]\" portraits of Factory visitors.<ref>Schaffner (1999), p. 73.</ref> One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.<ref>{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol & Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an \"homage\" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.\n\nWarhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.\n\nHis most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966).

His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter \"Warhol\" films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]\u2014more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Andy Warhol filmography"}]}, {"name": "more citations needed", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "section"}, {"name": "date", "value": "May 2019"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Andy Warhol Filmography"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The Internet Movie Database"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "September 29, 2009"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Uwe"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Husslein"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Pop goes art: Andy Warhol & Velvet Underground"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Wuppertal"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "oclc", "value": "165575494"}]}, {"name": "Page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "August 2010"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Hudson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "David"}, {"name": "title", "value": "This Is Softcore: The Art Cinema Erotica of Radley Metzger"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/daily-this-is-softcore-the-art-cinema-erotica-of-radley-metzger"}, {"name": "date", "value": "August 7, 2014"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[Fandor (film site)|Fandor]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "February 29, 2016"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Sandmir"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Richard"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Radley Metzger, Whose Artful Erotica Turned Explicit, Dies at 88"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/movies/radley-metzger-director-who-left-erotica-for-hard-core-dies-at-88.html"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 4, 2017"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The New York Times]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "April 5, 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Metzger"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Juliette"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Feldman"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Caryl"}, {"name": "last3", "value": "West"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Ashley"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Press Release: Radley Metzger, pioneering filmmaker, dies at 88"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/04/02/radley-metzger-2/"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 2, 2017"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The Rialto Report]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "April 2, 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->"}, {"name": "title", "value": "''The Lickerish Quartet''"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/the-lickerish-quartet"}, {"name": "date", "value": "August 8, 2014"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "May 24, 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Canby"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Vincent"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Vincent Canby"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Movie Review \u2013 Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie'"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE"}, {"name": "date", "value": "July 22, 1969"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The New York Times"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "December 29, 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Canby"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Vincent"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Vincent Canby"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

The episode depicts the attempted assassination of Warhol by [[Valerie Solanas]] ([[Lena Dunham]]).\n\nIn early 1969, Andy Warhol was commissioned by [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff International]] to appear in two television commercials to promote the luxury Airline's new When You Got It - Flaunt It Campaign. The campaign was created by Braniff's new advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by famed advertiser [[George Lois]], creator of a famed series of [[Esquire Magazine]] covers. The first commercial series involved pairing the most unlikely people but who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. Mr. Warhol was paired with boxing legend [[Sonny Liston]]. The odd commercial worked as did the others that featured unlikely fellow travelers such as painter [[Salvador Dali]] and baseball legend [[Whitey Ford]].\n\nTwo additional commercials for Braniff were created that featured famous persons entering a Braniff jet and being greeted a Braniff Hostess while espousing their like for flying Braniff. Mr. Warhol was also featured in the first of these commercials that were also produced by Mr. Lois and were released in the summer of 1969. Mr. Lois has incorrectly stated that he was commissioned by Braniff in 1967 for representation during that year but at that time Madison Avenue advertising doyenne [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who was married to Braniff's charismatic Chairman and President [[Harding Lawrence]], was representing the Dallas-based carrier at that time. Mr. Lois succeeded Wells Rich Greene Agency on December 1, 1968. The rights to Mr. Warhol's films for Braniff and his signed contracts are owned by a private Trust and are administered by Braniff Airways Foundation in Dallas, Texas.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cass |first1=Richard Benjamin |title=Braniff Airways Flying Colors |date=December 14, 2015 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing, Inc. |isbn=9781467134408 |page=74 |edition=1st |url=https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467134408?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroPGvtz25AIVENvACh0--AgaEAQYAiABEgISDfD_BwE}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite AV media", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Lommel, Ulli"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Cocaine Cowboys"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1979"}]}, {"name": "cite AV media", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Hickenlooper, George"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Factory Girl"}]}, {"name": "citation ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Horror Films of the 1990s"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "John Kenneth"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Muir"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "John Kenneth Muir"}, {"name": "page", "value": "236"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780786440122"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-446-39138-7"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/jared-leto-andy-warhol-biopic-movie"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Jared Leto to play Andy Warhol in biopic"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The Guardian"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "September 20, 2016"}]}, {"name": "cite press release", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "TLA Releasing Unveils the past of Famed Artist Andy Warhol to Reveal a Story Few Ever Imagined in: Absolut Warhola"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[TLA Releasing]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "March 9, 2004"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.tlavideo.com/images/assets/97.pdf"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "January 9, 2009"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20090207042433/http://www.tlavideo.com/images/assets/97.pdf"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "February 7, 2009"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Stephen"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Holden"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Stephen Holden"}, {"name": "date", "value": "September 1, 2006"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Visionary, a Voyeur and a Brand-Name Star"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/movies/01warh.html"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The New York Times"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "January 9, 2009"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.myandywarhol.eu/videos/videos1.asp"}, {"name": "title", "value": "My Andy Warhol\u2014Videos"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "December 4, 2013"}]}, {"name": "IMDb title", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1355272"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Welcome to the Silver Factory"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "website", "value": "PlanetGroupEntertainment"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://planetgroupentertainment.squarespace.com/andy-warhols-factory-people/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Andy Warhol's \"Factory People\""}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "December 4, 2013"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/tv-review-martin-scorseses-vinyl.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Martin Scorsese's Vinyl Is the Year's First Must-See Show"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Cass"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Richard Benjamin"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Braniff Airways Flying Colors"}, {"name": "date", "value": "December 14, 2015"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Arcadia Publishing, Inc."}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781467134408"}, {"name": "page", "value": "74"}, {"name": "edition", "value": "1st"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467134408?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroPGvtz25AIVENvACh0--AgaEAQYAiABEgISDfD_BwE"}]}], "id": 23}, {"title": "Films", "paragraphs": "[[File:Andy Warhol and Ulli Lommel on set of Cocaine Cowboys.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Warhol (right) with director [[Ulli Lommel]] on the set of 1979's ''[[Cocaine Cowboys (1979 film)|Cocaine Cowboys]]'', in which Warhol appeared as himself]]\nWarhol appeared as himself in the film ''[[Cocaine Cowboys (1979 film)|Cocaine Cowboys]]'' (1979)<ref>{{cite AV media|author=Lommel, Ulli |title=Cocaine Cowboys|date=1979}}</ref> and in the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982).\n\nAfter his death, Warhol was portrayed by [[Crispin Glover]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), by [[David Bowie]] in [[Julian Schnabel]]'s film ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), and by [[Jared Harris]] in [[Mary Harron]]'s film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' (1996).
