The family of Aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to [[Yahweh]]. The rest of his tribe, the [[Levite]]s, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3). Moses anointed and consecrated Aaron and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf. Exodus 28-29). He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1-7, 11-27). Aaron and his successors as high priest were given control over the [[Urim and Thummim]] by which the will of God could be determined (Exodus 28:30).<ref name=Olson>{{harvnb|Olson|2000|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> God commissioned the Aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean, and to teach the divine laws (the [[Torah]]) to the Israelites (Leviticus 10:10-11). The priests were also commissioned to bless the people (Numbers 6:22-27).<ref>{{harvnb|Mariottini|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|6:22|27|KJV}}</ref> When Aaron completed the altar offerings for the first time and, with Moses, \"blessed the people: and the glory of the {{LORD}} appeared unto all the people: And there came a fire out from before the {{LORD}}, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces\" (Leviticus 9:23-24).<ref>{{Bibleref|Leviticus|9:23|24|KJV}}</ref> In this way, the institution of the Aaronide priesthood was established.<ref name=\"phod\">{{harvnb|Souvay|1913|p=7}}</ref>\n\nIn later books of the Hebrew Bible, Aaron and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the [[Babylonian captivity]] and later. The books of [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The [[Book of Ezekiel]], which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the [[Zadokites]] after one of King David's priests.<ref name=Olson/> It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]]. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What is clear is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the [[Second Temple period]].<ref>{{harvnb|VanderKam|2004}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}</ref> Most scholars think the Torah reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.\n\n===Conflicts===\nAaron plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts during Israel's wilderness wanderings. During the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai, the people provoked Aaron to make a [[golden calf]]. (Exodus 32:1-6). This incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites (Exodus 32:10). Moses successfully intervened, but then led the loyal Levites in executing many of the culprits; a plague afflicted those who were left (Exodus 32:25-35).<ref>{{Bibleref|Exodus|32:35||KJV}}</ref> Aaron, however, escaped punishment for his role in the affair, because of the intercession of Moses according to Deuteronomy 9:20.<ref>{{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|9:20|| KJV }}</ref> Later retellings of this story almost always excuse Aaron for his role.<ref name=\"Watts 2011\">{{harvnb|Watts|2011}}</ref> For example, in rabbinic sources<ref>Talmud Shabbat 99a</ref><ref>Exodus Rabbah 41</ref> and in the Quran, Aaron was not the idol-maker and upon Moses' return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).<ref>{{Cite quran|7|142|e=152|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of Aaron's consecration, his oldest sons, [[Nadab and Abihu]], were burned up by divine fire because they offered \"strange\" incense (Leviticus 10:1-3).<ref>{{Bibleref|Leviticus|10:1|3||HE}}</ref> Most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between priestly families some time in Israel's past. Others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God's instructions given through Moses.<ref name=\"Watts 2011\"/>\n\nThe Torah generally depicts the siblings, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus, a view also reflected in the biblical [[Book of Micah]].<ref>{{bibleref|Micah|6:4|9}}</ref> Numbers 12, however, reports that on one occasion, Aaron and Miriam complained about Moses' exclusive claim to be the {{LORD}}'s prophet.<ref>{{bibleref|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref> Their presumption was rebuffed by God who affirmed Moses' uniqueness as the one with whom the {{LORD}} spoke face to face. Miriam was punished with a skin disease (''[[tzaraath]]'') that turned her skin white. Aaron pleaded with Moses to intercede for her, and Miriam, after seven days' quarantine, was healed. Aaron once again escaped any retribution.\n\nAccording to Numbers 16-17, a Levite named [[Korah]] led many in challenging Aaron's exclusive claim to the priesthood. When the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth (Numbers 16:25-35),<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|196:23|35|KJV}}</ref> [[Eleazar]], the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the [[censer]]s of the dead priests. And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|17:1|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|16:36|KJV}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hirschvogel The Blossoming of Aarons Rod.jpg|thumb|right|The Blossoming of Aaron's Rod, etching by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]]]\nTo emphasize the validity of the Levites' claim to the offerings and tithes of the Israelites, Moses collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods overnight in the [[tent of meeting]]. The next morning, Aaron's rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:8).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|17:8|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mays|2000|p=177}}</ref> The following chapter then details the distinction between Aaron's family and the rest of the Levites: while all the Levites (and only Levites) were devoted to the care of the sanctuary, charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the [[Kohen|Aaronites]] alone (Numbers 18:1-7).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|18:1|KJV}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nAaron, like Moses, was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites<ref name=\"jd3\"/> because the two brothers showed impatience at [[Meribah]] ([[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh]]) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the people's thirst. Although they had been commanded to speak to the rock, Moses struck it with the staff twice, which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the {{LORD}} (Numbers 20:7-11).<ref name=\"jd3\"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|20:7|11|KJV}}</ref>\n\nThere are two accounts of the death of Aaron in the Torah.<ref name=\"jd3\"/> Numbers says that soon after the incident at Meribah, Aaron with his son Eleazar and Moses ascended Mount Hor. There Moses stripped Aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to Eleazar. Aaron died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).<ref name=\"jd3\"/><ref name=\"Bibleref|Numbers|20:22|29|KJV\"/><ref name=\"Bibleref|Numbers|33:38|39|KJV\"/> The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where Aaron died at Moserah and was buried.<ref name=\"jd3\"/><ref name=\"Bibleref|Deuteronomy|10:6|KJV\"/> There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31\u201337 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and Mount Hor.<ref name=\"jd3\"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|33:31|37|KJV}}</ref> Aaron was 123 at the time of his death.<ref name=Colliers>{{harvnb|Gutstein|1997|p=3}}</ref>\n\n===Descendants===\nAaron married [[Elisheba]], daughter of [[Amminadab]] and sister of [[Nahshon]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 6:23) of the tribe of Judah.

Ironically, and likewise according to Samaritan sources, the high priests' line of the sons of Phineas died out in 1624 CE with the death of the 112th High Priest, Shlomyah ben Pinhas, at which time the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Itamar.

The family of Aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to [[Yahweh]]. The rest of his tribe, the [[Levite]]s, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3). Moses anointed and consecrated Aaron and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf. Exodus 28-29). He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1-7, 11-27).

It says that he was a descendant of Abraham (Quran 4: 163) and makes it clear that both he and Moses were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment (Quran 10: 75). It further adds that Moses had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with Aaron (Quran 20: 29-30) and that Aaron helped Moses as he too was a prophet (Quran 19: 53), and very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse (Quran 28: 34). The Quran adds that both Moses and Aaron were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God (Quran 10: 87).\n\nThe incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Quran paints Aaron in a positive light. The Quran says that Aaron was entrusted the leadership of Israel while Moses was up on ''Tur Sina\u2019'' ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u064f\u0640\u0648\u0631 \u0633\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0646\u0640\u0627\u0621}}, [[Mount Sinai]]) for a period of forty days (Quran 7: 142).<ref name=\"Cite quran|7|103|e=156|s=ns\"/> It adds that Aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by Aaron but by a wicked man by the name of '[[Samiri (Islamic figure)|As-Samiri]]' (Quran 19: 50). When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked Aaron for allowing the worship of the idol, to which Aaron pleaded with Moses to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Quran 7: 150).<ref name=\"Cite quran|7|103|e=156|s=ns\"/> The Quran then adds that Moses here lamented the sins of Israel, and said that he only had power over himself and Aaron (Quran 5: 25).\n\nAaron is later commemorated in the Quran as one who had a \"clear authority\" (Quran 23: 45) and one who was \"guided to the Right Path\" (Quran 37: 118). It further adds that Aaron's memory was left for people who came after him (Quran 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Quran 37: 120). The Quran also says that people called [[Jesus in Islam|\u2018Isa]]'s mother [[Mary in Islam|Maryam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0631\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0645}}, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]) a \"sister of Harun\" (Quran 19: 28). Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this \"Harun\" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to Aaron of the Exodus, and the term \"sister\" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when Mary was a descendant of the priestly lineage of Aaron, while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of [[Christ]] by the name of \"Aaron\". Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked Mary spiritually with the actual sister of Aaron, her namesake [[Miriam|Miryam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0650\u0640\u0631\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0645}}, {{lang-he|\u05de\u05b4\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05dd}}),<ref name=\"RU2016\">''Unless otherwise stated, the Jewish primary sources herein were provided courtesy of Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman in honor of M.A.M. from his 3-part series on Miriam the Prophetess, posted on RabbiUllman.com.
