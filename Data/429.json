By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly.\n\nAssembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as [[automobile]]s and other [[transportation]] equipment, [[household]] appliances and [[Consumer electronics|electronic goods]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "for", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the video game company"}, {"name": "2", "value": "The Assembly Line"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Concepts", "paragraphs": "[[File:Final assembly 3.jpg|thumb|[[Lotus Cars]] assembly line as of 2008]]\nAssembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of [[worker]]s, [[tool]]s or machines, and parts.

In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If [[engine]] installation takes 20 minutes, [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] installation takes five minutes, and [[wheel]]s installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.\n\nIn an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When a station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, three cars can be operated on at the same time, each at a different stage of assembly.\n\nAfter finishing its work on the first car, the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car. While the engine installation crew works on the second car, the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood, then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels. After the engine has been installed on the second car, the second car moves to the hood assembly. At the same time, the third car moves to the engine assembly. When the third car's engine has been mounted, it then can be moved to the hood station; meanwhile, subsequent cars (if any) can be moved to the engine installation station.\n\nAssuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another, the longest stage on the assembly line determines the [[throughput (business)|throughput]] (20 minutes for the engine installation) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes, once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], most manufactured products were made individually by hand.

The factory grounds were bordered by the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings. [[Crane (machine)|Cranes]] were used for lifting the heavy work, which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons.

The assembly line area was called '[[Long Shop Museum|The Long Shop]]' on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853. The [[boiler]] was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line, and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. From the upper level, where other parts were made, the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level.

The idea came in a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.<ref>{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p= 81}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Charles E. Sorensen]], in his 1956 memoir ''My Forty Years with Ford'', presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual \"inventors\" as a gradual, logical development of [[industrial engineering]]:\n\n{{quote|What was worked out at Ford was the practice of moving the work from one worker to another until it became a complete unit, then arranging the flow of these units at the right time and the right place to a moving final assembly line from which came a finished product. Regardless of earlier uses of some of these principles, the direct line of succession of mass production and its intensification into automation stems directly from what we worked out at Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1913. Henry Ford is generally regarded as the father of mass production. He was not. He was the sponsor of it.<ref>{{harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=116}}.</ref>}}\n\nAs a result of these developments in method, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, or six feet per minute.<ref>{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|Chapter IV}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/> It was so successful, [[paint]] became a bottleneck. Only [[japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society. Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nFord's complex safety procedures\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of [[injury]]. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"[[Fordism]]\", and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nIn the [[automotive industry]], its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany and Ford Japan 1925; in 1919, Vulcan (Southport, Lancashire) was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe massive demand for military hardware in World War II prompted assembly-line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production. Thousands of [[Liberty Ship]]s were built making extensive use of prefabrication, enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days. After having produced fewer than 3,000 planes for the United States Military in 1939, American aircraft manufacturers built over 300,000 planes in World War II. [[Vultee]] pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing. Other companies quickly followed. As [[William S. Knudsen]] (having worked at Ford,<ref name=Weber2013/> GM and the National Defense Advisory Commission) observed, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Herman|2012|pp=176\u201391}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parker|2012|pp=5\u201312}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Merson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2014"}]}, {"name": "full citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2014"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Roe"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1916"}]}, {"name": "page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2014"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hounshell"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1984"}]}, {"name": "page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2014"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1-873592-87-6"}]}, {"name": "pn", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Musson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Robinson"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1969"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "491\u20135"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.industriouseast.org.uk/index.php?pageId=147&anchor=164&filter=gb"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Long Shop Museum"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2012-12-17"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150601151902/http://www.industriouseast.org.uk/index.php?pageId=147&anchor=164&filter=gb"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "2015-06-01"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "full citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2014"}]}, {"name": "cn", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wells"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1890"}]}, {"name": "page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2014"}]}, {"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1885"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Patterson, 2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "71\u201379"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.caranddriver.com/features/fords-assembly-line-turns-100-how-it-really-put-the-world-on-wheels-feature"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ford's Assembly Line Turns 100: How It Really Put the World on Wheels"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Tony"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Swan"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Car and driver]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 2013"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "26 March 2017"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Domm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "p", "value": "29"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Phil"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Ament"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/assbline.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Assembly Line History: Invention of the Assembly Line"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Ideafinder.com"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2011-10-15"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Klann"}, {"name": "first", "value": "W.

The idea came in a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.<ref>{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p= 81}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Charles E. Sorensen]], in his 1956 memoir ''My Forty Years with Ford'', presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual \"inventors\" as a gradual, logical development of [[industrial engineering]]:\n\n{{quote|What was worked out at Ford was the practice of moving the work from one worker to another until it became a complete unit, then arranging the flow of these units at the right time and the right place to a moving final assembly line from which came a finished product.

Only [[japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society. Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nFord's complex safety procedures\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of [[injury]]. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"[[Fordism]]\", and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nIn the [[automotive industry]], its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany and Ford Japan 1925; in 1919, Vulcan (Southport, Lancashire) was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe massive demand for military hardware in World War II prompted assembly-line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production. Thousands of [[Liberty Ship]]s were built making extensive use of prefabrication, enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days. After having produced fewer than 3,000 planes for the United States Military in 1939, American aircraft manufacturers built over 300,000 planes in World War II. [[Vultee]] pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing. Other companies quickly followed. As [[William S.

Ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the Model T price. These goals appear altruistic; however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that \"every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963\" in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=Matthew |title=Shop Class as Soulcraft |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |work=[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601015022/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |archivedate=2013-06-01 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Crawford"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Matthew"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Shop Class as Soulcraft"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130601015022/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2013-06-01"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Sociological problems", "paragraphs": "[[Sociology|Sociological]] work has explored the [[social alienation]] and [[boredom]] that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 4105309 |title= Alienation and Freedom: The Factory Worker and His Industry |authorlink= Bob Blauner |first= Robert |last= Blauner |journal= [[Technology and Culture]] |volume= 6 |issue= 3 |date= Summer 1965 |pages= 518\u2013519}}</ref>\n\nOne of capitalism's most famous critics, [[Karl Marx]], expressed in his ''[[Marx's theory of alienation|Entfremdung]]'' theory the belief that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they have created, that products should be \"mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature.\" Marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalize facets of our personality. Marxists argue that specialization makes it very difficult for any worker to feel they may be contributing to the real needs of humanity. The repetitive nature of specialized tasks causes, they say, a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day, who they really are, and what they would ideally be able to contribute to society. Marx also argued that specialised jobs are insecure, since the worker is expendable as soon as costs rise and technology can replace more expensive human labour.<ref>Marx, Karl. \"Comment on James Mill,\" ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'': 1844.</ref>\n\nSince workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive stress injuries]] are a possible pathology of [[occupational safety]].
