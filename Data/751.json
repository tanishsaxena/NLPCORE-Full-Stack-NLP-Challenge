Although he was not the founder of the [[Komnenos|Komnenian dynasty]], it was during his reign that the Komnenos family came to full power. Inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the [[Seljuq Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in the western [[Balkans]], Alexios was able to curb the Byzantine decline and begin the military, financial, and territorial recovery known as the ''[[Komnenian restoration]]''. The basis for this recovery were various reforms initiated by Alexios. His appeals to Western Europe for help against the Turks were also the catalyst that likely contributed to the convoking of the [[Crusades]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Alexius I"}]}, {"name": "redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Alexios Komnenos"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "12th-century Byzantine emperor"}]}, {"name": "Infobox Monarch\n", "values": [{"name": "image", "value": "Alexios I Komnenos.jpg"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Portrait of Emperor Alexios&nbsp;I, from a Greek manuscript"}, {"name": "succession", "value": "[[List of Byzantine emperors|Emperor]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]]"}, {"name": "reign", "value": "1 April 1081<ref name=\"Alexiad, 2.10\">\"Alexiad\", 2.10</ref>{{snd}}15 August 1118"}, {"name": "coronation", "value": "5 April 1081<ref name=\"Alexiad, 3.2\">\"Alexiad\", 3.2</ref>"}, {"name": "predecessor", "value": "[[Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates]]"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "[[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]]"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "[[Irene Doukaina]]"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "{{plainlist|\n*[[Anna Komnene]]\n*[[Maria Komnene (1085\u20131136)|Maria Komnene]]\n*[[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]]\n*[[Andronikos Komnenos (1091\u20131131)|Andronikos Komnenos]]\n*[[Eudokia Komnene (daughter of Alexios I)|Eudokia Komnene]]\n*[[Theodora Komnene (b. 1096)|Theodora Komnene]]\n*[[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Komnenos]]\n*[[Manuel Komnenos (b. 1097)|Manuel Komnenos]]\n*[[Zoe Komnene]]}}"}, {"name": "house", "value": "[[Komnenos dynasty|Komnenoi]]"}, {"name": "house-type", "value": "Dynasty"}, {"name": "father", "value": "[[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]]"}, {"name": "mother", "value": "[[Anna Dalassene]]"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "1048"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "15 August 1118 (aged 69\u201370)"}, {"name": "title", "value": "[[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans]]"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "*[[Anna Komnene]]\n*[[Maria Komnene (1085\u20131136)|Maria Komnene]]\n*[[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]]\n*[[Andronikos Komnenos (1091\u20131131)|Andronikos Komnenos]]\n*[[Eudokia Komnene (daughter of Alexios I)|Eudokia Komnene]]\n*[[Theodora Komnene (b. 1096)|Theodora Komnene]]\n*[[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Komnenos]]\n*[[Manuel Komnenos (b. 1097)|Manuel Komnenos]]\n*[[Zoe Komnene]]"}]}, {"name": "lang-grc-gre", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "Circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1048"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " Life ", "paragraphs": "Alexios was the son of the [[Domestic of the Schools]] [[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]] and [[Anna Dalassene]],<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 63\">Kazhdan 1991, p. 63</ref> and the nephew of [[Isaac&nbsp;I Komnenos]] (emperor 1057\u20131059).

This did not, however, lead to a demotion, as Alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] of Southern Italy, led by [[Robert Guiscard]].\n\n===Conspiracy and revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneiates===\nWhile Byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition, the Doukas faction at court approached Alexios and convinced him to join a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against Nikephoros&nbsp;III. The mother of Alexios, Anna Dalassene, was to play a prominent role in this coup d'\u00e9tat of 1081, along with the current empress, [[Maria of Alania]].<ref name=\"Garland 2007\">Garland 2007</ref> First married to Michael&nbsp;VII Doukas and secondly to [[Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates]], she was preoccupied with the future of her son by Michael&nbsp;VII, [[Constantine Doukas (co-emperor)|Constantine Doukas]]. Nikephoros&nbsp;III intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives,<ref name=\"Finlay 1854, p. 59\">Finlay 1854, p. 59</ref> and this resulted in Maria's ambivalence and alliance with the Komnenoi, though the real driving force behind this political alliance was Anna Dalassene.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.2.1\u20132</ref>\n\nThe empress was already closely connected to the Komnenoi through Maria's cousin Irene's marriage to Isaac Komnenos,<ref name=\"Finlay 1854, p. 59\" /> so the Komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit. Furthermore, to aid the conspiracy Maria had adopted Alexios as her son, though she was only five years older than he.<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 5\">Norwich 1995, p. 5</ref> Maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own \"Alans\" and her eunuchs, who had been instigated by Isaac Komnenos. Given Anna's tight hold on her family, Alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> As a result, Alexios and Constantine, Maria's son, were now adoptive brothers, and both Isaac and Alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2,1,4\u20136, 2.3.2\u20133,2.3.4; cf. Bryennius 4.2, who dates the adoption to early in the reign of Botaneiates</ref> By secretly giving inside information to the Komnenoi, Maria was an invaluable ally.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.3.4,2.4.5</ref>\n\n[[File:Seal of Alexios Komnenos as Grand Domestic of the West.jpg|thumb|250px|Seal of Alexios as \"[[Domestic of the Schools|Grand Domestic of the West]]\"]]\n\nAs stated in the Alexiad, Isaac and Alexios left Constantinople in mid-February 1081 to raise an army against Botaneiates.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 6</ref> However, when the time came, Anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the [[Hagia Sophia]]. From there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital, while protesting her sons' innocence of hostile actions. Under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church, she deliberately excluded the grandson of Botaneiates and his loyal tutor, met with Alexios and Isaac, and fled for the forum of Constantine.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> The tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds, but Anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly. Then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church, the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from [[Cappadocia]] who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip. However, before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary, Straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> Anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives, her sons were loyal subjects (Alexios and Isaac were discovered absent without leave), and had learned of a plot by enemies of the Komnenoi to have them both blinded and had, therefore, fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.5.5</ref> She refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the [[Mother of God]] for protection. This request was granted and Anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities:\n\n{{quote|She was allowed to enter. As if she were weighed down with old age and worn out by grief, she walked slowly and when she approached the actual entrance to the sanctuary made two genuflections; on the third she sank to the floor and taking firm hold of the sacred doors, cried in a loud voice: \"Unless my hands are cut off, I will not leave this holy place except on one condition: that I receive the emperor's cross as guarantee of safety\".<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.5.6</ref>}}\n[[File:Alex1.png|thumb|right|200px|Alexios I. Manuscript illustration.]]\nNikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> Straboromanos tried to give Anna his cross, but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath. She also demanded that the cross be personally sent by Botaneiates as a vow of his good faith. He obliged, sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross. At the emperor's further insistence, and for their own protection, they took refuge at the convent of Petrion, where they were eventually joined by [[Maria of Bulgaria]], mother of Irene Doukaina.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> Botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than as guests. They were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.5.7\u20139</ref> Anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt: she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city; she distracted the emperor, giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops; and she gave a false sense of security to Botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> After bribing the Western troops guarding the city, Isaac and Alexios Komnenos entered the capital victoriously on April 1, 1081.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 63</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Alexios was rumored to be the lover of Empress [[Maria Bagrationi|Maria of Alania]], the daughter of King [[Bagrat&nbsp;IV of Georgia]], who had been successively married to [[Michael&nbsp;VII]] Doukas and his successor Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates, and who was renowned for her beauty.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 10</ref> Alexios arranged for Maria to stay on the palace grounds, and it was thought that he was considering marrying her. However, his mother consolidated the Doukas family connection by arranging the Emperor's marriage to [[Irene Doukaina]], granddaughter of the [[John Doukas, Caesar|Caesar John Doukas]], the uncle of Michael&nbsp;VII, who would not have supported Alexios otherwise. As a measure intended to keep the support of the Doukai, Alexios restored [[Constantine Doukas (co-emperor)|Constantine Doukas]], the young son of Michael&nbsp;VII and Maria, as co-emperor<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 12</ref> and a little later betrothed him to his own first-born daughter [[Anna Komnene|Anna]], who moved into the Mangana Palace with her fianc\u00e9 and his mother.\n\nThis situation changed drastically, however, when Alexios' first son [[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]] was born in 1087:<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 658\">Kazhdan 1991, p. 658</ref> Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, and she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother. Alexios became estranged from Maria, who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery, and Constantine Doukas was deprived of his status as co-emperor.<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 658\" /> Nevertheless, he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards.\n\n===Wars against the Normans, Pechenegs, and Tzachas===\n{{Details|Byzantine-Norman Wars}}\n\nThe nearly thirty-seven year reign of Alexios was full of struggle. At the outset he faced the formidable attack of the Normans, led by [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemund]], who took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]] and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]]<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success. He enhanced his resistance by bribing the German king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;IV]] with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy,<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 21</ref> which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083\u201384. He also secured the alliance of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]], who controlled the [[Gargano Peninsula]] and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. Henry's allegiance would be the last example of Byzantine political control on peninsular Italy. The Norman danger subsided with the death of Guiscard in 1085, and the Byzantines recovered most of their losses.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 25</ref>\n\nAlexios next had to deal with disturbances in [[Thrace]], where the heretical sects of the [[Bogomils]] and the [[Paulicians]] revolted and made common cause with the [[Pechenegs]] from beyond the [[Danube]].<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 101</ref> Paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during Alexios' battles with the Normans.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 78</ref> As soon as the Norman threat had passed, Alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters, confiscating their lands. This led to a further revolt near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and the commander of the field army in the west, Gregory Pakourianos, was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle. In 1087 the Pechenegs raided into Thrace, and Alexios crossed into [[Moesia]] to retaliate but failed to take Dorostolon ([[Silistra]]).<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 102</ref> During his retreat, the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the Pechenegs, who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money. In 1090 the Pechenegs invaded Thrace again,<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 104</ref> while [[Tzachas]], the brother-in-law of the Sultan of [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Rum]], launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of Constantinople with the Pechenegs.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 26</ref> Alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of 40,000 [[Cumans]], with whose help he crushed the Pechenegs at [[Battle of Levounion|Levounion]] in Thrace on 29 April 1091.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 27</ref>\n\nThis put an end to the Pecheneg threat, but in 1094 the Cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the Balkans. Led by a pretender claiming to be [[Constantine Diogenes (pretender)|Constantine Diogenes]], a long-dead son of the Emperor [[Romanos&nbsp;IV]],<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 86</ref> the Cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern Thrace until their leader was eliminated at [[Adrianople]]. With the Balkans more or less pacified, Alexios could now turn his attention to [[Asia Minor]], which had been almost completely overrun by the [[Seljuq Turks]].<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 108</ref>\n\n===Byzantine-Seljuq Wars and the First Crusade===\n{{further|Byzantine-Seljuq Wars|First Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|right|thumb|300px|{{center|Europe in 1097, during the [[First Crusade]]}}]]\n\nBy the time Alexios ascended the throne, the Seljuqs had taken most of Asia Minor. Alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the Seljuq camps, but these victories were unable to stop the Turks altogether.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 111</ref> As early as 1090, Alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the [[Papacy]],<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 30</ref> with the intention of seeking western support against the Seljuqs. In 1095 his ambassadors appeared before [[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Piacenza]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The help he sought from the West was simply some [[mercenary]] forces, not the immense hosts that arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment, after the pope preached the [[First Crusade]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] later that same year.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 31</ref> This was the [[People's Crusade]]: a mob of mostly unarmed pilgrims led by the preacher [[Peter the Hermit]]. Not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories, the emperor saw his Balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 33</ref> Eventually Alexios dealt with the People's Crusade by hustling them on to Asia Minor. There, they were massacred by the Turks of [[Kilij Arslan I]] at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479\">Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479</ref>\n\nThe \"Prince's Crusade\", the second and much more formidable host of crusaders, gradually made its way to [[Constantinople]], led in sections by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond IV of Toulouse]], and other important members of the western nobility.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 36</ref> Alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived, extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 123</ref> Transferring each contingent into Asia, Alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage. The crusade was a notable success for Byzantium, as Alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands. The [[siege of Nicaea]] by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in 1097, and the subsequent crusader victory at [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Dorylaion]] allowed the Byzantine forces to recover much of western Asia Minor.<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 42\">Norwich 1995, p. 42</ref> [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]] re-established Byzantine rule in [[Chios]], [[Rhodes]], [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sardis]], and [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] in 1097\u20131099. This success is ascribed by Alexios' daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 1099, a Byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing [[Laodicea in Syria|Laodicea]] and other coastal towns as far as [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].

In 1117 he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the Turkish-dominated Anatolian Plateau, where he defeated the Seljuq sultan at the [[Battle of Philomelion]].{{sfn|Sewter|1969|pp=481\u2013487}}\n\n===Personal life===\nDuring the last twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 54</ref> The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] and [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] heresies<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 81</ref>\u2014one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake [[Basil the Physician|Basil]], a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479\" /> In spite of the success of the First Crusade, Alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the Seljuqs in 1110\u20131117.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 58</ref>\n\nAlexios was for many years under the strong influence of an ''eminence grise'', his mother [[Anna Dalassene]], a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene Doukaina.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 59</ref> Alexios was never happier than when taking part in military exercises and he assumed personal command of his troops whenever possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantium: The Decline and Fall|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Knopf|year=1996|isbn=0394537785|edition=First American |location=New York|pages=52|oclc=18164817}}</ref> As such, Dalassene was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexios' long absences in military campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Komnene.\n\n===Succession===\nAlexios' last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession.
