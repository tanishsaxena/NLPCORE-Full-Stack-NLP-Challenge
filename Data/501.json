Arius taught that Jesus Christ was divine/holy and was sent to earth for the salvation of mankind<ref name=\"www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk\" /> but that Jesus Christ was not equal to God the Father (infinite, primordial origin) in rank ''and'' that God the Father and the Son of God were not equal to the Holy Spirit (power of God the Father).<ref name=\"ritchies.net\" /> Under Arianism, Christ was instead not consubstantial with God the Father<ref name=\"Pomazansky\">\"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father.\" ''Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition'' Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pp.&nbsp;92\u201395</ref> since both the Father and the Son under Arius were made of \"like\" essence or being (see [[homoiousia]]) but not of the same essence or being (see [[homoousia]]).<ref name=Pomazansky/>\n\nIn the Arian view, God the Father is a Deity and is divine ''and'' the Son of God is not a Deity but divine (I, the LORD, am Deity alone.

His opponents argued that this would make Jesus less than God and that this was heretical.<ref name=Pomazansky/> Much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father.<ref name=Pomazansky/> The theological term for this submission is [[kenosis]]. This ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct being of God in existence or reality ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), which the Latin fathers translated as persona. Jesus was God in essence, being and nature (ousia), which the Latin fathers translated as substantia.\n\nConstantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed\u2014Arius himself, the deacon Euzoios, and the Libyan bishops Theonas of Marmarica and [[Secundus of Ptolemais]]\u2014and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia and [[Theognis of Nicaea]]. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the ''Thalia'', the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be [[Book burning|burned]]. However, there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor, [[Constantius II]], who was a Semi-Arian Christian, was exiled.\n\nAlthough he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicaea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council. First, he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius's rehabilitation.<ref name=\"Jonathan Kirsch 2004\">Edward Gibbons \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", Chapter 21, (1776\u201388), Jonathan Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism\", 2004, and [[Charles Freeman (historian)|Charles Freeman]], ''[[The Closing of the Western Mind]]: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason'', 2002.</ref>\n\nAt the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in AD 335, they brought accusations against [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria|Athanasius]], now bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius. After this, Constantine had Athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the Synod of Jerusalem under Constantine's direction readmitted [[Arius]] to communion in 336. Arius died on the way to this event in Constantinople. Some scholars suggest that Arius may have been poisoned by his opponents.<ref name=\"Jonathan Kirsch 2004\" /> Eusebius and Theognis remained in the Emperor's favor, and when Constantine, who had been a [[catechumen]] much of his adult life, accepted [[baptism]] on his deathbed, it was from Eusebius of Nicomedia.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1984 176\" />\n\n===Aftermath of Nicaea===\nThe Council of Nicaea did not end the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the ''[[homoousios]]'', the central term of the Nicene Creed, as it had been used by [[Paul of Samosata]], who had advocated a [[Monarchianism|monarchianist]] [[Christology]]. Both the man and his teaching, including the term ''homoousios'', had been condemned by the [[Synods of Antioch]] in 269.\n\nHence, after Constantine's death in 337, open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son [[Constantius II]], who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire, actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene Creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made the bishop of Constantinople.\n\nConstantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene Creed, especially St [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who fled to Rome. In 355 Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy toward the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling [[Pope Liberius]] and installing [[Antipope Felix II]].\n\nThe [[Third Council of Sirmium]] in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both ''homoousios'' (of one substance) and ''homoiousios'' (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium.)\n\n<blockquote>\nBut since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin ''substantia'', but in Greek ''ousia'', that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/second-creed-of-sirmium-or-the-blasphemy-of-sirmium/ |title=Second Creed of Sirmium or 'The Blasphemy of Sirmium' |website=www.fourthcentury.com |access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene Creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term ''homoiousios'' (alike in substance) to the Nicene ''homoousios'', while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and co-eternality of the persons of the Trinity. Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called \"semi-Arians\" by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like (''[[Acacians|homoios]]'') the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike (''[[Anomoeanism|anhomoios]]'') the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] labeled the party of [[Basil of Ancyra]] in 358 \"[[Semi-Arianism]]\". This is considered unfair by Kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective ''homoousios'' while others had moved in that direction after the out-and-out Arians had come into the open.<ref>Kelly J. N. D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&G Black 1965, p. 249</ref>\n\nThe debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods, among them the [[Council of Serdica]] in 343, the [[Fourth Council of Sirmium]] in 358 and the double [[Council of Rimini]] and Seleucia in 359, and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, leading the pagan observer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] to comment sarcastically: \"The highways were covered with galloping bishops.\" None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint [[Jerome]] remarked that the world \"awoke with a groan to find itself Arian.\"\n\nAfter Constantius' death in 361, his successor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], a devotee of [[State religion of Rome|Rome's pagan gods]], declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this resulted in further increasing dissension among Nicene Christians. The Emperor [[Valens]], however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the \"Homoian\" party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire (e.g., Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] to the Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene Creed and the ''homoousios'' and the Eastern semi-Arians.\n\n===Council of Constantinople===\n{{Main|Theodosius I}}\nIt was not until the co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Valens died in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 and was succeeded by [[Theodosius I]], who adhered to the Nicene Creed. This allowed for settling the dispute. Theodosius' wife St [[Aelia Flacilla|Flacilla]] was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism.\n\nTwo days after Theodosius arrived in Constantinople, 24 November 380, he expelled the [[Homoiousian]] bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and surrendered the churches of that city to [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], the leader of the rather small Nicene community there, an act which provoked rioting. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world. In February he and [[Gratian]] had published an edict<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.iii.xii.iv.html |title=Sozomen's Church History VII.4 |publisher=ccel.org}}</ref> that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith), or be handed over for punishment for not doing so.\n\nAlthough much of the church hierarchy in the East had opposed the Nicene Creed in the decades leading up to Theodosius' accession, he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the Nicene Creed.

His opponents argued that this would make Jesus less than God and that this was heretical.<ref name=Pomazansky/> Much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father.<ref name=Pomazansky/> The theological term for this submission is [[kenosis]]. This ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct being of God in existence or reality ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), which the Latin fathers translated as persona. Jesus was God in essence, being and nature (ousia), which the Latin fathers translated as substantia.\n\nConstantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed\u2014Arius himself, the deacon Euzoios, and the Libyan bishops Theonas of Marmarica and [[Secundus of Ptolemais]]\u2014and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia and [[Theognis of Nicaea]]. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the ''Thalia'', the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be [[Book burning|burned]]. However, there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor, [[Constantius II]], who was a Semi-Arian Christian, was exiled.\n\nAlthough he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicaea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council. First, he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius's rehabilitation.<ref name=\"Jonathan Kirsch 2004\">Edward Gibbons \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", Chapter 21, (1776\u201388), Jonathan Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism\", 2004, and [[Charles Freeman (historian)|Charles Freeman]], ''[[The Closing of the Western Mind]]: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason'', 2002.</ref>\n\nAt the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in AD 335, they brought accusations against [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria|Athanasius]], now bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius. After this, Constantine had Athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the Synod of Jerusalem under Constantine's direction readmitted [[Arius]] to communion in 336. Arius died on the way to this event in Constantinople. Some scholars suggest that Arius may have been poisoned by his opponents.<ref name=\"Jonathan Kirsch 2004\" /> Eusebius and Theognis remained in the Emperor's favor, and when Constantine, who had been a [[catechumen]] much of his adult life, accepted [[baptism]] on his deathbed, it was from Eusebius of Nicomedia.<ref name=\"Gonzalez 1984 176\" />\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Seven Ecumenical Councils"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.iii.html"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Christian Classics Ethereal Library"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "NPNF2-14"}]}, {"name": "lang-grc", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-913836-31-1"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-227-67919-9"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Aftermath of Nicaea", "paragraphs": "The Council of Nicaea did not end the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the ''[[homoousios]]'', the central term of the Nicene Creed, as it had been used by [[Paul of Samosata]], who had advocated a [[Monarchianism|monarchianist]] [[Christology]]. Both the man and his teaching, including the term ''homoousios'', had been condemned by the [[Synods of Antioch]] in 269.\n\nHence, after Constantine's death in 337, open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son [[Constantius II]], who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire, actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene Creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made the bishop of Constantinople.\n\nConstantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene Creed, especially St [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who fled to Rome. In 355 Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy toward the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling [[Pope Liberius]] and installing [[Antipope Felix II]].\n\nThe [[Third Council of Sirmium]] in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both ''homoousios'' (of one substance) and ''homoiousios'' (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium.)\n\n<blockquote>\nBut since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin ''substantia'', but in Greek ''ousia'', that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/second-creed-of-sirmium-or-the-blasphemy-of-sirmium/ |title=Second Creed of Sirmium or 'The Blasphemy of Sirmium' |website=www.fourthcentury.com |access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene Creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term ''homoiousios'' (alike in substance) to the Nicene ''homoousios'', while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and co-eternality of the persons of the Trinity. Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called \"semi-Arians\" by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like (''[[Acacians|homoios]]'') the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike (''[[Anomoeanism|anhomoios]]'') the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] labeled the party of [[Basil of Ancyra]] in 358 \"[[Semi-Arianism]]\". This is considered unfair by Kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective ''homoousios'' while others had moved in that direction after the out-and-out Arians had come into the open.<ref>Kelly J. N. D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&G Black 1965, p. 249</ref>\n\nThe debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods, among them the [[Council of Serdica]] in 343, the [[Fourth Council of Sirmium]] in 358 and the double [[Council of Rimini]] and Seleucia in 359, and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, leading the pagan observer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] to comment sarcastically: \"The highways were covered with galloping bishops.\" None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint [[Jerome]] remarked that the world \"awoke with a groan to find itself Arian.\"\n\nAfter Constantius' death in 361, his successor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], a devotee of [[State religion of Rome|Rome's pagan gods]], declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this resulted in further increasing dissension among Nicene Christians. The Emperor [[Valens]], however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the \"Homoian\" party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire (e.g., Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] to the Eastern provinces).

Binitarian churches generally believe that the Father is greater than the Son, a view somewhat similar to Arianism.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "non-primary source needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2016"}]}, {"name": "original research inline", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2016"}]}, {"name": "quotation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "We believe in one true God who is the creator of all.
