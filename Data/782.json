Thanks. -->\n{{Sex and the Law}}\n{{Youth rights sidebar}}\nThe '''age of consent''' is the age at which a person is considered to be [[legally competent]] to [[consent]] to [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]]. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was [[Consent|consensual]], and such sexual activity may be considered [[child sexual abuse]] or [[statutory rape]]. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances.\n\nThe term ''age of consent'' rarely appears in legal [[statute]]s.<ref name=\"waites\">{{cite book| last=Waites| first=Matthew| title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2005| isbn=1-4039-2173-3| oclc=238887395}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2017}} Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to [[marriageable age|marriage]],<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry for \"age of consent\"</ref> but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], and [[List of countries by minimum driving age|driving age]].\n\nAge of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,<ref name=\"waites\" /> though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a [[position of trust]]; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a [[misdemeanor]], such as ''corruption of a minor'', to what is popularly called ''statutory rape''.\n\nThere are many \"grey areas\" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between [[federal law|federal]] and [[state law|state]] laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.<ref name=\"waites\" />\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name":

In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent\"/>\n\nIn the 12th century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential founder of [[canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN\u2014BOOK FOUR\u2014TITLE I\u2014Betrothals and Marriages\u2014C3 |quote=If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archive-date=17 January 2016 }}</ref> There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage.

Early feminists of the [[Social Purity movement]], such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], began to turn towards the problem of [[child prostitution]] by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.\n\nThe investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he \"purchased\" one victim, [[The Eliza Armstrong Case|Eliza Armstrong]], the thirteen-year-old daughter of a [[chimney sweep]], for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four expos\u00e9s entitled ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'', which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental \"pleasure palaces\". The \"Maiden Tribute\" was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|title = Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140727184445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|archive-date = 27 July 2014|last = Hogenbloom|first = Melissa|date = 1 November 2012|publisher = BBC History}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The New York Times/1895/10/15/Purity Congress Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

Often, enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor (e.g. a teacher, minister, or doctor).

However, where such a defense is provided, it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show [[due diligence]] in determining the age of the victim (e.g. an underage person who used a fake identification document claiming to be of legal age).<ref>{{cite journal|author =Larry W.

For instance, in [[Canada]], the age of consent is 16, but there are two close-in-age exemptions: sex with minors aged 14\u201315 is permitted if the partner is less than five years older, and sex with minors aged 12\u201313 is permitted if the partner is less than two years older.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=2008-05-01|access-date=22 March 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090320002644/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/01/crime-bill.html| archive-date= 20 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of a similar age and development: for instance, the age of consent in [[Finland]] is 16, but the law states that the act will not be punished if \"there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039 |title=FINLEX \u00ae\u2014Translations of Finnish acts and decrees: 39/1889 English |publisher=Finlex.fi |date=2009-05-29 |access-date=14 January 2013}}</ref> Another approach takes the form of a stipulation that sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed a certain age.

However, such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged. Within [[Bermuda]] for example (since 1 November, 2019 under section 177 of the Criminal Code Act 1907) the age of consent for vaginal and oral sex is 16, but for anal sex it is 18. In Canada, the United Kingdom and Western Australia, for example, the age of consent was originally 21 for same-sex sexual activity between males (with no laws regarding [[lesbian]] sexual activities), while it was 16 for [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] sexual activity; this is no longer the case and the age of consent for all sexual activity is 16.<ref>''The Causes and Cures of Criminality'' Eysenck, Hans 1989 Plenum Press New York page 229</ref> In June 2019, the Canadian Government repealed the section of the Criminal Code that set a higher age of consent for anal intercourse.<ref>{{cite act |type=bill |date=21 June 2019 |legislature=Parliament of Canada |title=Bill C-75 |url=https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-75/royal-assent}}</ref>\n; Gender-age differentials: In some jurisdictions (such as [[Indonesia]]<ref name=\"Indonesia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaIndonesia.asp |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080229151529/http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaIndonesia.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 February 2008 |title=Sexual Offences Laws \u2013 Indonesia |publisher=Interpol |access-date=5 September 2009 }}</ref>), there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity that are based on the gender of each person.

In these jurisdictions, it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage, so the ''de facto'' age of consent is the marriageable age. In Kuwait, this means that boys must be at least 17 and girls at least 15 years old.\n; Position of authority/trust: In most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below 18 (such as England and Wales),<ref name=SOA2003_a>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 16 to&nbsp;24) |publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)}}</ref> in cases where a person aged 18 or older is in a position of trust over a person under 18, the age of consent usually rises to 18 or higher. Examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students. For example, in England and Wales the age of consent is 16, but if the person is a student of the older person it becomes&nbsp;18.\n\n; Circumstances of the relationship: In several jurisdictions, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under a certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question, such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person. For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called \"estupro\" defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, he/she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he/she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person.\n\n===Extraterritoriality===\n{{see also|Child sex tourism#Extraterritorial jurisdiction}}\nA growing number of countries have specific [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial legislation]] that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children.

In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent\"/>\n\nIn the 12th century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential founder of [[canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN\u2014BOOK FOUR\u2014TITLE I\u2014Betrothals and Marriages\u2014C3 |quote=If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archive-date=17 January 2016 }}</ref> There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage.

The phrase \"within age\" was later interpreted by jurist Sir [[Edward Coke]] (England, 17th century) as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.<ref name=\"Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia\">{{cite web|last=Robertson|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Sydney, Australia|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230|title=Children and Youth in History &#124; Age of Consent Laws|website=Chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=30 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627095601/http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230|archive-date=27 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide.

Early feminists of the [[Social Purity movement]], such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], began to turn towards the problem of [[child prostitution]] by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.\n\nThe investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he \"purchased\" one victim, [[The Eliza Armstrong Case|Eliza Armstrong]], the thirteen-year-old daughter of a [[chimney sweep]], for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four expos\u00e9s entitled ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'', which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental \"pleasure palaces\". The \"Maiden Tribute\" was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|title = Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140727184445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|archive-date = 27 July 2014|last = Hogenbloom|first = Melissa|date = 1 November 2012|publisher = BBC History}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The New York Times/1895/10/15/Purity Congress Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called \"estupro\" defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, he/she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he/she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Larry W.

Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an \"unequal act\" for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs,<ref>UNFPA writes that \"Biologically, women's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of men.\"[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents]</ref> and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in ''[[Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County|Michael M. v.

This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an \"unequal act\" for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs,<ref>UNFPA writes that \"Biologically, women's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of men.\"[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents]</ref> and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready.
