That ideology spanned many different fields of interest. It may have its roots in the ancient [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] of [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]] competing in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. The ancient Greek citizens spent most of their time in other pursuits, but competed according to their natural talents and abilities.\n\nThe \"gentleman amateur\" was a phenomenon among the [[gentry]] of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] from the 17th century until the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Duncan|title=Deconstructing the Gentleman Amateur (article version)|url=https://www.academia.edu/34556804/Deconstructing_the_Gentleman_Amateur_article_version_|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=May 16, 2018|language=en}}</ref> With the start of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], with people thinking more about how the world works around them, (see [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment]]), things like the [[Cabinet of Curiosities]], and the writing of the book ''[[The Christian Virtuoso]]'', started to shape the idea of the gentleman amateur. He was vastly interested in a particular topic, and studied, observed, and collected things and information on his topic of choice. The [[Royal Society]] in Great Britain was generally composed of these \"gentleman amateurs\", and is one the reasons science today exists the way it does. A few examples of these gentleman amateurs are [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]].\n\nAmateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often lack formal training, some amateur work may be considered sub-par. For example, amateur athletes in sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]], or [[Football games|football]] are regarded as possessing a lower level of ability than professional athletes. On the other hand, an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.  An amateur dabbles in a field out of interest rather than as a profession, or possesses a general but superficial interest in any art or a branch of knowledge, is often referred to as a [[wiktionary:dilettante|dilettante]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Stone"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Duncan"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Deconstructing the Gentleman Amateur (article version)"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.academia.edu/34556804/Deconstructing_the_Gentleman_Amateur_article_version_"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.academia.edu"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "May 16, 2018"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": " Amateur athletics ", "paragraphs": "{{main|Amateur sports}}\nThe line between ''amateur'' and ''professional'' has always been blurred in athletics with the central idea being that amateurs should not receive material reward for taking part in sports.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taonga|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=Amateurism and professionalism \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/amateurism-and-professionalism/page-1|website=teara.govt.nz|accessdate=May 15, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is amateurism?|url=https://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|website=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|accessdate=May 15, 2018|language=en|date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517085526/http://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|archive-date=17 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lack of financial benefit can be seen as a sign of [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to a sport; until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs.
