Prior to autopsy, the death was attributed to natural causes by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the contractor administering the base. However, an autopsy in New Zealand revealed that Dr. Marks died from [[methanol]] poisoning. The [[New Zealand Police]] launched an investigation. In 2006, frustrated by lack of progress, the Christchurch Coroner said that it was unlikely that Dr. Marks ingested the methanol knowingly, although there is no certainty that he died as the direct result of the act of another person. During media interviews, the police detective in charge of the investigation criticized the National Science Foundation and contractor [[Raytheon]] for failing to co-operate with the investigation.<ref name=\"TelegraphChapman\">Chapman, Paul.
