Being a [[landlocked country]], Armenia has no [[navy]].\n\nThe [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the military is the [[Prime Minister of Armenia]], [[Nikol Pashinyan]]. The Ministry of Defence is in charge of political leadership, headed by Davit Tonoyan, while military command remains in the hands of the [[general staff]], headed by the Chief of Staff, who is [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Artak Davtyan]]. [[Armenia]] established a Ministry of Defence on 28 January 1992. Border guards subject to the Ministry patrol Armenia's borders with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], while [[Russia]]n troops continue to monitor its borders with [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/102-military-base.htm|title=102nd Military Base|author=John Pike|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref>  Since 2002, Armenia has been a member of the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/csto.htm|title=Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)|author=John Pike|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> Armenia signed a military cooperation plan with [[Lebanon]] on 27 November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://massispost.com/2015/11/armenia-and-lebanon-sign-2016-military-cooperation-plan/ |title=Armenia and Lebanon Sign 2016 Military Cooperation Plan - Armenian News By MassisPost |publisher=Massispost.com |date= 2015-11-27|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "combined military forces of Armenia"}]}, {"name": "infobox national military\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Armed Forces of Armenia"}, {"name": "native_name", "value": "\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0566\u056b\u0576\u057e\u0561\u056e \u0578\u0582\u056a\u0565\u0580"}, {"name": "image", "value": "[[File:Armmil zinanshan.jpg|150px]]"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Emblem of the Armed Forces of Armenia"}, {"name": "founded", "value": "May 28, 1918"}, {"name": "current_form", "value": "{{start date and age|1992|1|28|df=y}}"}, {"name": "branches", "value": "[[Armenian Army]]<br>[[Armenian Air Force]]<br>[[Armenian Air Defense|Armenian Air Defence]]<br>[[Armenian Border Guard]]"}, {"name": "headquarters", "value": "[[Yerevan]]"}, {"name": "flying_hours", "value": "<!-- Leadership -->"}, {"name": "commander-in-chief", "value": "[[Nikol Pashinyan]]"}, {"name": "commander-in-chief_title", "value": "Supreme Commander in Chief"}, {"name": "minister", "value": "[[David Tonoyan]]"}, {"name": "minister_title", "value": "[[Defence minister of Armenia|Minister of Defence]]"}, {"name": "commander", "value": "[[Artak Davtyan]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Artak Davtyan appointed Armenian army chief |url=https://news.am/eng/news/453082.html |accessdate=4 June 2018 |agency=[[news.am]] |date=24 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Armenia army has a new chief of General Staff |url=http://panarmenian.net/eng/news/255910 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |agency=[[PanARMENIAN Network]] |date=25 May 2018}}</ref>"}, {"name": "commander_title", "value": "[[Chief of the General Staff (Armenia)|Chief of the General Staff]]\n<!-- Manpower -->"}, {"name": "age", "value": "18-27<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2024.html |title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>"}, {"name": "conscription", "value": "24 months"}, {"name": "manpower_age", "value": "15\u201349"}, {"name": "available", "value": "809,576"}, {"name": "available_f", "value": "870, 864<ref>{{cite book| title = The World Factbook 2008| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5lc9jxSKfuEC&pg=PA32| year = 2009| publisher = Government Printing Office| isbn = 978-0-16-087361-4 }}</ref>"}, {"name": "fit", "value": "637, 776"}, {"name": "fit_f", "value": "729, 846"}, {"name": "reaching", "value": "31,774"}, {"name": "reaching_f", "value": "31,182"}, {"name": "active", "value": "51,580 (Army 45,580 Air Force & AD 7,000).

[[Armenia]]n officials have consistently expressed determination to comply with its provisions and thus Armenia has provided data on armaments as required under the CFE Treaty. Despite this, Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of diverting a large part of its military forces to [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]] and thus circumventing these international regulations. Armenia is not a significant exporter of conventional weapons, but it has provided support, including material, to the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] of Nagorno-Karabakh during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].\n\nIn March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. Armenia acceded to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-[[nuclear weapon]]s state in July 1993.

Their main functions include deterrence, defense, [[peace]] support and [[crisis management]], humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Armenian society.\n\nThe Active Forces mainly have peacekeeping and defensive duties, and are further divided into Deployment Forces, Immediate Reaction, and Main Defense Forces. The Reserve Forces consists of Enhancement Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, and Training Grounds. They deal with planning and reservist preparation, armaments and equipment storage, training of formations for active forces rotation or increase in personnel.\n\nDuring peacetime the Army maintains permanent [[combat]] and [[mobilization]] readiness. They become part of multinational military formations in compliance with [[international treaties]] Armenia is a signatory to, participate in the preparation of the population, the national economy and the maintenance of wartime reserves and the [[infrastructure]] of the country for defense.\n\nIn times of crisis the Army's main tasks relate to participation in operations countering [[terrorism|terrorist activities]] and defense of strategic facilities (such as [[nuclear power]] plants and major industrial facilities), assisting the security forces in proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], illegal armaments traffic and international terrorism.\n\nIn case of low- and medium-intensity military conflict the Active Forces that are part of the Army participate in carrying out the initial tasks for the defense of the [[territorial integrity]] and [[sovereignty]] of the country.

There are also 24 [[Scud]] [[ballistic missile]]s with eight launchers.\nNumerical strength is estimated at about 3,000 servicemen, with plans for further expansion.\n\nIn late December 2010, the Armenian Defense Minister, Seyran Ohanyan, officially acknowledged that the army are equipped with the Russian-made [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] surface-to-air missiles.  The statement was made while the Minister was inspecting a new air-defense command point that maintains \"state-of-the-art equipment\" built specifically for the operation of the S-300's. Russian specialist started to train Armenian teams on sophisticated Missiles and Defensive Systems. The [[S-300 missile system|S-300]] was paraded for the first time in the 2011 Parade and the only [[S-300 missile system]] ([[S-300 missile system|SA10 Grumble]]) which likes mobility.

To this end, the CSTO holds yearly military command exercises for the CSTO nations to have an opportunity to improve inter-organisation cooperation. The largest-scale CSTO military exercise held, to date, were the \"Rubezh 2008\" exercises hosted in [[Armenia]] where a combined total of 4,000 troops from all 7 constituent CSTO member countries conducted operative, strategic, and tactical training with an emphasis towards furthering the efficiency of the collective security element of the CSTO partnership.<ref>[http://www.pims.org/news/2008/08/06/rubezh-2008-the-first-large-scale-csto-military-exercise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210230833/http://www.pims.org/news/2008/08/06/rubezh-2008-the-first-large-scale-csto-military-exercise|date=February 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Defense of Armenia has repeatedly stated that it would expect direct military assistance from the CSTO in case war with Azerbaijan resumes, as recently as December 2009, Defense Minister Ohanyan made the same statement.

Cooperative Best Effort exercise (the first where Russia was represented) was run on Armenian territory in 2003.\n\n=== Greece ===\n[[Greece]] is Armenia's closest ally in NATO and the two cooperate on multiple issues. A number of Armenian officers are trained in Greece every year, and military aid/material assistance has been provided to Armenia. In 2003, the two countries signed a military cooperation accord, under which Greece will increase the number of Armenian servicemen trained at the military and military-medical academies in Athens.\n\nIn February 2003, [[Armenia]] sent 34 peace keepers to [[Kosovo]] where they became part of the [[Greece|Greek]] contingent. Officials in [[Yerevan]] have said the Armenian military plans to substantially increase the size of its peace-keeping detachment and counts on Greek assistance to the effort. In June 2008, Armenia sent 72 peacekeepers to Kosovo for a total of 106 peacekeepers.\n\n=== Baltic States ===\n[[Lithuania]] has been sharing experience and providing consultations to the Armenian Defense Ministry in the field of democratic control of armed forces, military and defense concepts and public relations since 2002. Started in 2004, Armenian officers have been invited to study at the [[General Jonas \u017demaitis Military Academy of Lithuania|Lithuanian War Academy]] and the [[Baltic Defence College]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]].
