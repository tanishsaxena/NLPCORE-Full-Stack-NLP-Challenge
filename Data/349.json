In ''An Autobiography'', Christie states, \"I was still writing in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] tradition \u2013 eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a [[Inspector Lestrade|Lestrade]]-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp\".<ref>Reproduced as the \"Introduction\" to {{harvnb|Christie|2013}}</ref> For his part, Conan Doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[C. Auguste Dupin]] and his anonymous narrator, and basing his character Sherlock Holmes on [[Joseph Bell]], who in his use of \"[[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]]\" prefigured Poirot's reliance on his \"little grey cells\".\n\nPoirot also bears a striking resemblance to [[A. E. W. Mason]]'s fictional detective, [[Inspector Hanaud]] of the French [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]], who first appeared in the 1910 novel ''[[At the Villa Rose (novel)|At the Villa Rose]]'' and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years.\n\nUnlike the models mentioned above, Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. His Belgian nationality was interesting because of Belgium's occupation by Germany, which also provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be out of work and available to solve mysteries at an [[English country house]].{{sfn|Christie|1939}} At the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the Belgians,<ref>{{cite book|author=Horace Cornelius Peterson|title=Propaganda for War.

Following the latter, Poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot/ |title=Poirot |publisher=Official Agatha Christie website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412131601/http://uk.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot/ |archivedate=12 April 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hercule Poirot is Dead; Famed Belgian Detective; Hercule Poirot, the Detective, Dies |first=Thomas |last=Lask |date=6 August 1975 |page=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E10F63A5E157493C4A91783D85F418785F9}}</ref>\n\nBy 1930, Agatha Christie found Poirot \"insufferable\", and, by 1960, she felt that he was a \"detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep\". Yet the public loved him and Christie refused to kill him off, claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5054 |title=Agatha Christie (1890\u20131976) |date=16 July 2001 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |first=Chris |last=Willis |work=The Literary Encyclopedia |publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company |issn=1747-678X}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and proclivities ===\n\n[[Captain Arthur Hastings]]'s first description of Poirot:\n\n{{quote|He was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. Even if everything on his face was covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible.\n\nThe neatness of his attire was almost incredible; I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.{{sfn|Christie|1939}}}}\n\nAgatha Christie's initial description of Poirot in ''The Murder on the Orient Express'':\n\n{{quote|By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform, conversing with a small man [Hercule Poirot] muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache.{{sfn|Christie|2011}}}}\n\nIn the later books, his limp is not mentioned, suggesting it may have been a temporary wartime injury. (In ''[[Curtain: Poirot's Last Case|Curtain]]'', Poirot admits he was wounded when he first came to England.) Poirot has green eyes that are repeatedly described as shining \"like a cat's\" when he is struck by a clever idea,<ref>E.g. \"For about ten minutes [Poirot] sat in dead silence ... and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener\" {{harvnb|Christie|1939|loc=Chapter 5}}</ref> and dark hair, which he dyes later in life. In ''Curtain'', he admits to Hastings that he wears a wig and a false moustache.<ref>as Hastings discovers in {{harvnb|Christie|1991|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> However, in many of his screen incarnations, he is bald or balding.\n\nFrequent mention is made of his [[patent leather]] shoes, damage to which is frequently a source of misery for him, but comical for the reader.<ref>E.g. \"Hercule Poirot looked down at the tips of his patent-leather shoes and sighed.\" {{harvnb|Christie|1947a}}</ref> Poirot's appearance, regarded as fastidious during his early career, later falls hopelessly out of fashion.<ref>E.g. \"And now here was the man himself. Really a most impossible person \u2013 the wrong clothes \u2013 button boots! an incredible moustache! Not his \u2013 Meredith Blake's kind of fellow at all.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011|loc=Chapter 7}}</ref> He employs [[pince-nez]] reading glasses.\n\nAmong Poirot's most significant personal attributes is the sensitivity of his stomach:\n\n{{quote|The plane dropped slightly. ''\"Mon estomac,\"'' thought Hercule Poirot, and closed his eyes determinedly.{{sfn|Christie|2010|loc=Chapter 1}}}}\n\nHe suffers from [[sea sickness]],<ref>\"My stomach, it is not happy on the sea\"{{harvnb|Christie|1980|loc=Chapter 8, iv}}</ref> and, in ''Death in the Clouds'', he states that his air sickness prevents him from being more alert at the time of the murder. Later in his life, we are told:\n\n{{quote|Always a man who had taken his stomach seriously, he was reaping his reward in old age. Eating was not only a physical pleasure, it was also an intellectual research.{{sfn|Christie|2010|loc=Chapter 1}}}}\n\nPoirot is extremely punctual and carries a [[pocket watch]] almost to the end of his career.<ref>\"he walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the bell, glancing as he did so at the neat wrist-watch which had at last replaced an old favourite \u2013 the large turnip-faced watch of early days. Yes, it was exactly nine-thirty. As ever, Hercule Poirot was exact to the minute.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011b}}</ref> He is also particular about his personal finances, preferring to keep a bank balance of 444&nbsp;pounds, 4 shillings, and 4 pence.{{sfn|Christie|2013a}} Actor [[David Suchet]], who portrayed Poirot on television, said \"there's no question he's [[obsessive-compulsive]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/19/david-suchet-poirot-agatha-christie|title=Laura Barton meets David Suchet, star of Agatha Christie's Poirot|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 November 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Film portrayer [[Kenneth Branagh]] said that he \"enjoyed finding the sort of obsessive-compulsive\" in Poirot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/10/563378736/kenneth-branagh-on-his-meticulous-master-detective-role-in-murder-on-the-orient-|title=Kenneth Branagh On His Meticulous Master Detective Role In 'Murder On The Orient Express'|publisher=NPR |access-date=26 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs mentioned in ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[The Clocks]]'', he is fond of classical music, particularly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]].\n\n=== Methods ===\n\nIn ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', Poirot operates as a fairly conventional, clue-based and logical detective; reflected in his vocabulary by two common phrases: his use of \"[[Grey matter|the little grey cells]]\" and \"order and method\". Hastings is irritated by the fact that Poirot sometimes conceals important details of his plans, as in ''The Big Four''.{{sfn|Christie|2004b}} In this novel, Hastings is kept in the dark throughout the climax. This aspect of Poirot is less evident in the later novels, partly because there is rarely a narrator to mislead.\n\nIn ''Murder on the Links,'' still largely dependent on clues himself, Poirot mocks a rival \"bloodhound\" detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues established in detective fiction (e.g., Sherlock Holmes depending on [[footprints]], [[fingerprint]]s, and cigar ash). From this point on, Poirot establishes his psychological bona fides. Rather than painstakingly examining crime scenes, he enquires into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer. He predicates his actions in the later novels on his underlying assumption that particular crimes are committed by particular types of people.\n\nPoirot focuses on getting people to talk. In the early novels, he casts himself in the role of \"Papa Poirot\", a benign confessor, especially to young women. In later works, Christie made a point of having Poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining information.<ref>\"It has been said of Hercule Poirot by some of his friends and associates, at moments when he has maddened them most, that he prefers lies to truth and will go out of his way to gain his ends by elaborate false statements, rather than trust to the simple truth.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011b|loc= Book One, Chapter 9}}</ref> In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', Poirot speaks of a non-existent mentally disabled nephew<ref>E.g. \"After a careful study of the goods displayed in the window, Poirot entered and represented himself as desirous of purchasing a rucksack for a hypothetical nephew.\" ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', Chapter 13</ref> to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit. In ''Dumb Witness'', Poirot invents an elderly invalid mother as a pretence to investigate local nurses. In ''The Big Four'', Poirot pretends to have (and poses as) an identical twin brother named Achille: however, this brother was mentioned again in ''The Labours of Hercules''.{{sfn|Christie|2004b}}\n\n<blockquote>\"If I remember rightly \u2013 though my memory isn't what it was \u2013 you also had a brother called Achille, did you not?\u201d Poirot's mind raced back over the details of Achille Poirot's career. Had all that really happened? \"Only for a short space of time,\" he replied.{{sfn|Christie|1947|p=}}</blockquote>\n\nPoirot is also willing to appear more foreign or vain in an effort to make people underestimate him. He admits as much:\n\n<blockquote>It is true that I can speak the exact, the idiomatic English. But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an enormous asset. It leads people to despise you. They say \u2013 a foreigner \u2013 he can't even speak English properly. ... Also I boast! An Englishman he says often, \"A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much.\" ... And so, you see, I put people off their guard.{{sfn|Christie|2006b|loc=final chapter}}</blockquote>\n\nIn later novels, Christie often uses the word ''mountebank'' when characters describe Poirot, showing that he has successfully passed himself off as a [[charlatan]] or fraud.\n\nPoirot's investigating techniques assist him solving cases; \"For in the long run, either through a lie, or through truth, people were bound to give themselves away...\"{{sfn|Christie|2005|loc=Chapter 18}} At the end, Poirot usually reveals his description of the sequence of events and his deductions to a room of suspects, often leading to the culprit's apprehension.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5054"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Agatha Christie (1890\u20131976)"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "6 September 2006"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Chris"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Willis"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London Metropolitan University"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1939"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Horace Cornelius Peterson"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Propaganda for War.

E. W. Mason]]'s fictional detective, [[Inspector Hanaud]] of the French [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]], who first appeared in the 1910 novel ''[[At the Villa Rose (novel)|At the Villa Rose]]'' and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years.\n\nUnlike the models mentioned above, Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. His Belgian nationality was interesting because of Belgium's occupation by Germany, which also provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be out of work and available to solve mysteries at an [[English country house]].{{sfn|Christie|1939}} At the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the Belgians,<ref>{{cite book|author=Horace Cornelius Peterson|title=Propaganda for War.

(In ''[[Curtain: Poirot's Last Case|Curtain]]'', Poirot admits he was wounded when he first came to England.) Poirot has green eyes that are repeatedly described as shining \"like a cat's\" when he is struck by a clever idea,<ref>E.g. \"For about ten minutes [Poirot] sat in dead silence ... and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener\" {{harvnb|Christie|1939|loc=Chapter 5}}</ref> and dark hair, which he dyes later in life.

Hastings is irritated by the fact that Poirot sometimes conceals important details of his plans, as in ''The Big Four''.{{sfn|Christie|2004b}} In this novel, Hastings is kept in the dark throughout the climax. This aspect of Poirot is less evident in the later novels, partly because there is rarely a narrator to mislead.\n\nIn ''Murder on the Links,'' still largely dependent on clues himself, Poirot mocks a rival \"bloodhound\" detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues established in detective fiction (e.g., Sherlock Holmes depending on [[footprints]], [[fingerprint]]s, and cigar ash). From this point on, Poirot establishes his psychological bona fides. Rather than painstakingly examining crime scenes, he enquires into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer. He predicates his actions in the later novels on his underlying assumption that particular crimes are committed by particular types of people.\n\nPoirot focuses on getting people to talk. In the early novels, he casts himself in the role of \"Papa Poirot\", a benign confessor, especially to young women. In later works, Christie made a point of having Poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining information.<ref>\"It has been said of Hercule Poirot by some of his friends and associates, at moments when he has maddened them most, that he prefers lies to truth and will go out of his way to gain his ends by elaborate false statements, rather than trust to the simple truth.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011b|loc= Book One, Chapter 9}}</ref> In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', Poirot speaks of a non-existent mentally disabled nephew<ref>E.g. \"After a careful study of the goods displayed in the window, Poirot entered and represented himself as desirous of purchasing a rucksack for a hypothetical nephew.\" ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', Chapter 13</ref> to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit. In ''Dumb Witness'', Poirot invents an elderly invalid mother as a pretence to investigate local nurses. In ''The Big Four'', Poirot pretends to have (and poses as) an identical twin brother named Achille: however, this brother was mentioned again in ''The Labours of Hercules''.{{sfn|Christie|2004b}}\n\n<blockquote>\"If I remember rightly \u2013 though my memory isn't what it was \u2013 you also had a brother called Achille, did you not?\u201d Poirot's mind raced back over the details of Achille Poirot's career. Had all that really happened? \"Only for a short space of time,\" he replied.{{sfn|Christie|1947|p=}}</blockquote>\n\nPoirot is also willing to appear more foreign or vain in an effort to make people underestimate him. He admits as much:\n\n<blockquote>It is true that I can speak the exact, the idiomatic English. But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an enormous asset. It leads people to despise you. They say \u2013 a foreigner \u2013 he can't even speak English properly. ... Also I boast! An Englishman he says often, \"A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much.\" ... And so, you see, I put people off their guard.{{sfn|Christie|2006b|loc=final chapter}}</blockquote>\n\nIn later novels, Christie often uses the word ''mountebank'' when characters describe Poirot, showing that he has successfully passed himself off as a [[charlatan]] or fraud.\n\nPoirot's investigating techniques assist him solving cases; \"For in the long run, either through a lie, or through truth, people were bound to give themselves away...\"{{sfn|Christie|2005|loc=Chapter 18}} At the end, Poirot usually reveals his description of the sequence of events and his deductions to a room of suspects, often leading to the culprit's apprehension.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Book One, Chapter 9"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1947"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "final chapter"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 18"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": " Life ", "paragraphs": "[[File:2011-07-26 Belgique - Ellezelles - Hercule Poirot 002.jpg|thumb|230px|Statuette of Poirot in [[Ellezelles]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\n===Origins===\nChristie was purposely vague about Poirot's origins, as he is thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels. In ''An Autobiography,'' she admitted that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920. At the time, however, she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come.\n\nA brief passage in ''The Big Four'' provides original information about Poirot's birth or at least childhood in or near the town of [[Spa, Belgium]]: \"But we did not go into Spa itself. We left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills, till we reached a little hamlet and an isolated white villa high on the hillside.\"{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 16}} Christie strongly implies that this \"quiet retreat in the [[Ardennes]]\"{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 17}} near Spa is the location of the Poirot family home.\n \nAn alternative tradition holds that Poirot was born in the village of [[Ellezelles]] (province of Hainaut, Belgium).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://magazine.bellesdemeures.com/en/luxury/lifestyle/province-hainaut-village-ellezelles-adopts-detective-hercule-poirot-article-27759.html|title=In the province of Hainaut, the village of Ellezelles adopts detective Hercule Poirot|website=Belles Demeures|language=en-gb|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> A few memorials dedicated to Hercule Poirot can be seen in the centre of this village. There appears to be no reference to this in Christie's writings, but the town of Ellezelles cherishes a copy of Poirot's birth certificate in a local memorial 'attesting' Poirot's birth, naming his father and mother as Jules-Louis Poirot and Godelieve Poirot.\n\nChristie wrote that Poirot is a Catholic by birth,<ref>\"Hercule Poirot was a Catholic by birth.\" {{harvnb|Christie|1947a}}</ref> but not much is described about his later religious convictions, except sporadic references to his \"going to church\".<ref>In ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'', Book II, Chapter 6 Poirot goes into church to pray and happens across a suspect with whom he briefly discusses ideas of sin and confession. {{harvnb|Christie|1948}}</ref> Christie provides little information regarding Poirot's childhood, only mentioning in ''Three Act Tragedy'' that he comes from a large family with little wealth, and has at least one younger sister. Apart from French and English, Poirot is also fluent in German.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2011|loc=Chapter 12}}</ref>\n\n=== Policeman ===\n\n<blockquote>Gustave ... was not a policeman. I have dealt with policemen all my life and I ''know''. He could pass as a detective to an outsider but not to a man who was a policeman himself.\n\n: \u2014 Hercule Poirot {{harvnb|Christie|1947c}}</blockquote>\n\nHercule Poirot was active in the [[Brussels]] police force by 1893.{{sfn|Christie|2009b|loc=Chapter 15}} Very little mention is made about this part of his life, but in \"[[The Labours of Hercules#The Nemean Lion|The Nemean Lion]]\" (1939) Poirot refers to a Belgian case of his in which \"a wealthy soap manufacturer ... poisoned his wife in order to be free to marry his secretary\". As Poirot was often misleading about his past to gain information, the truthfulness of that statement is unknown; it does however scare off a would be killer of his wife.\n\nIn the short story [[Poirot's Early Cases#The Chocolate Box|\"The Chocolate Box\"]] (1923), Poirot reveals to [[Captain Arthur Hastings]] an account of what he considers to be his only failure. Poirot admits that he has failed to solve a crime \"innumerable\" times:\n\n<blockquote>I have been called in too late. Very often another, working towards the same goal, has arrived there first. Twice I have been struck down with illness just as I was on the point of success.</blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, he regards the 1893 case in \"The Chocolate Box\",<ref>The date is given in {{harvnb|Christie|2009b|loc=Chapter 15}}</ref> as his only actual failure of detection. Again, Poirot is not reliable as a narrator of his personal history and there is no evidence that Christie sketched it out in any depth. During his police career Poirot shot a man who was firing from a roof into the public below.{{sfn|Christie|1975|loc=Postscript}} In ''[[Lord Edgware Dies]]'', Poirot reveals that he learned to read writing upside down during his police career. Around that time he met Xavier Bouc, director of the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]]. Poirot also became a uniformed director, working on trains.\n\nInspector Japp offers some insight into Poirot's career with the Belgian police when introducing him to a colleague:\n\n<blockquote>You've heard me speak of Mr Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked together \u2013 the Abercrombie forgery case \u2013 you remember he was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were the days Moosier. Then, do you remember \"Baron\" Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in Antwerp \u2013 thanks to Mr. Poirot here.{{sfn|Christie|1939|loc=Chapter 7}}</blockquote>\n\nIn ''The Double Clue,'' Poirot mentions that he was Chief of Police of Brussels, until \"the Great War\" (World War I) forced him to leave for England. (In ''[[The Mysterious  Affair at Styles]]'' Poirot had retired at age 55 in 1905)\n\n=== Private detective ===\n\n<blockquote>I had called in at my friend Poirot's rooms to find him sadly overworked. So much had he become the rage that every rich woman who had mislaid a bracelet or lost a pet kitten rushed to secure the services of the great Hercule Poirot.{{sfn|Christie|2013b}}</blockquote>\n\nDuring World War I, Poirot left Belgium for England as a [[refugee]], although he returned a few times. On 16 July 1916 he again met his lifelong friend, Captain Arthur Hastings, and solved the first of his cases to be published, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles''. It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel, as Hastings tells Cynthia that he has not seen him for \"some years\". Particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium, are given in ''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'', Chapter 1.  After that case, Poirot apparently came to the attention of the British secret service and undertook cases for the British government, including foiling the attempted abduction of the [[Prime Minister of Britain|Prime Minister]].<ref>Recounted in {{harvnb|Christie|2012}}</ref> Readers were told that the British authorities had learned of Poirot's keen investigative ability from certain members of [[Belgian Royal Family|Belgium's royal family]].\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = <!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->\n | background color  = <!-- box background -->\n | total_width       = <!-- total width of all the displayed images in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix) -->\n | caption_align     = <!-- left (default), center, right -->\n\n | image1            = Florin Court (2).jpg\n | width1            = 200\n | height1           = 200\n | alt1              = \n | link1             = \n | caption1          =\n\n | image2            = Florin Court-13909277428.jpg\n | width2            = 200\n | height2           = 200\n | alt2              = \n | link2             = \n | caption2          =\n\n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = \n | footer            = [[Florin Court]] became the fictional residence of Agatha Christie's Poirot, known as \"Whitehaven Mansions\"\n}}\nAfter the war Poirot became a private detective and began undertaking civilian cases. He moved into what became both his home and work address, Flat 203 at 56B Whitehaven Mansions. Hastings first visits the flat when he returns to England in June 1935 from Argentina in ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', Chapter 1. The TV programmes place this in [[Florin Court]], Charterhouse Square, in the wrong part of London.  According to Hastings, it was chosen by Poirot \"entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion\" and described as the \"newest type of service flat\". (The Florin Court building was actually built in 1936, decades after Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case in this period was \"The Affair at the Victory Ball\", which allowed Poirot to enter high society and begin his career as a private detective.\n\nBetween the world wars, Poirot travelled all over Europe, Africa, Asia, and half of South America investigating crimes and solving murders. Most of his cases occurred during this time and he was at the height of his powers at this point in his life. In ''The Murder on the Links'', the Belgian pits his grey cells against a French murderer. In the Middle East, he solved the cases ''Death on the Nile'' and ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' with ease and even survived ''An Appointment with Death''. As he passed through Eastern Europe on his return trip, he solved ''The Murder on the Orient Express''. However he did not travel to North America, the West Indies, the Caribbean or Oceania, probably to avoid sea sickness.\n\n<blockquote>It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The ''mal de mer'' \u2013 it is horrible suffering!<ref>Poirot, in {{harvnb|Christie|2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was during this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims to have been a member of the Russian aristocracy before the Russian Revolution and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of that story is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.<ref>Cassatis, John (1979). ''The Diaries of A. Christie''. London.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is the misfortune of small, precise men always to hanker after large and flamboyant women. Poirot had never been able to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the Countess held for him.<ref>\"The Capture of Cerebus\" (1947). The first sentence quoted is also a close paraphrase of something said to Poirot by Hastings in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''{{harvnb|Christie|2004b}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough letting the Countess escape was morally questionable, it was not uncommon. In ''The Nemean Lion'', Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, allowing her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare the feelings of the murderer's relatives. In ''The Augean Stables'', he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In ''Murder on the Orient Express'', Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder, each one stabbing the victim in a darkened carriage after drugging him into unconsciousness so that there is no way for anyone to definitively determine which of them actually delivered the killing blow. The victim had been committed a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of at least five people. There was no question of his guilt, but he had been acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternative sequence of events to explain the death involving an unknown additional passenger on the train, with the medical examiner agreeing to doctor his own report to support this theory.\n\nAfter his cases in the Middle East, Poirot returned to Britain. Apart from some of the so-called \"Labours of Hercules\" (see next section) he very rarely went abroad during his later career. He moved into Styles Court towards the end of his life.\n\nWhile Poirot was usually paid handsomely by clients, he was also known to take on cases that piqued his curiosity, although they did not pay well.\n\nPoirot shows a love of steam trains, which Christie contrasts with Hastings' love of autos: this is shown in ''[[Poirot's Early Cases|The Plymouth Express]]'', ''[[The Mystery of the Blue Train]]'', ''Murder on the Orient Express'', and ''The ABC Murders'' (in the TV series, steam trains are seen in nearly all of the episodes).\n\n=== Retirement ===\n\n<blockquote>That\u2019s the way of it. Just a case or two, just one case more \u2013 the Prima Donna\u2019s farewell performance won\u2019t be in it with yours, Poirot.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2006a}} Dr. Burton in the Preface</ref></blockquote>\n\nConfusion surrounds Poirot's retirement. Most of the cases covered by Poirot's private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow [[Squash (plant)|marrows]], at which time he solves ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd''. It has been said that the twelve cases related in ''The Labours of Hercules'' (1947) must refer to a different retirement, but the fact that Poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before ''Roger Ackroyd'', and presumably Poirot closed his agency once he had completed them. There is specific mention in \"The Capture of Cerberus\" of the twenty-year gap between Poirot's previous meeting with Countess Rossakoff and this one. If the ''Labours'' precede the events in ''Roger Ackroyd'', then the Ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years ''later'' than it was published, and so must any of the cases that refer to it. One alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once, Poirot is determined to have another go, but this is specifically denied by Poirot himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2004a|loc=Chapter 13}} in response to the suggestion that he might take up gardening in his retirement, Poirot answers \"Once the vegetable marrows, yes \u2013 but never again\".</ref> Also, in \"The Erymanthian Boar\", a character is said to have been turned out of Austria by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], implying that the events of ''[[The Labours of Hercules]]'' took place after 1937. Another alternative would be to suggest that the Preface to the ''Labours'' takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years. None of the explanations is especially attractive.\n\nIn terms of a rudimentary chronology, Poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 18}} (1927) which places that novel out of published order before ''Roger Ackroyd''. He declines to solve a case for the Home Secretary because he is retired in Chapter One of ''Peril at End House'' (1932). He is certainly retired at the time of ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1935) but he does not enjoy his retirement and repeatedly takes cases thereafter when his curiosity is engaged. He continues to employ his secretary, Miss Lemon, at the time of the cases retold in ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' and ''Dead Man's Folly'', which take place in the mid-1950s. It is therefore better to assume that Christie provided no authoritative chronology for Poirot's retirement, but assumed that he could either be an active detective, a consulting detective, or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required.\n\nOne consistent element about Poirot's retirement is that his fame declines during it, so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters (especially younger characters) recognise neither him nor his name:\n\n<blockquote>\"I should, perhaps, Madame, tell you a little more about myself. I am ''Hercule Poirot''.\"<br/>\n\nThe revelation left Mrs Summerhayes unmoved.<br/>\n\n\"What a lovely name,\" she said kindly. \"Greek, isn't it?\"{{sfn|Christie|1952|loc=Chapter 4}}</blockquote>\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n{{Quote | He, I knew, was not likely to be far from his headquarters. The time when cases had drawn him from one end of England to the other was past. |  Hastings{{Sfn |Christie|2004b|loc = Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}}\n\nPoirot is less active during the cases that take place at the end of his career. Beginning with ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a subgenre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events. In novels such as ''Taken at the Flood'', ''[[After the Funeral]]'', and ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In ''Cat Among the Pigeons'', Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought. Whether this was a reflection of his age or of Christie's distaste for him, is impossible to assess. ''[[Crooked House]]'' (1949) and ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (1957), which could easily have been Poirot novels, represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works.\n\nTowards the end of his career, it becomes clear that Poirot's retirement is no longer a convenient fiction.  He assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels. He even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Wilkie Collins]].{{sfn|Christie | 2011c |loc =Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}  In the absence of a more appropriate puzzle, he solves such inconsequential domestic riddles as the presence of three pieces of orange peel in his umbrella stand.{{sfn|Christie | 2006a |loc=Chapter 14}} {{Page needed | date = August 2014}}\n\nPoirot (and, it is reasonable to suppose, his creator){{efn | In ''The Pale Horse'', Chapter 1, the novel's narrator, Mark Easterbrook, disapprovingly describes a typical \"Chelsea girl\"{{Sfn | Christie |1961}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} in much the same terms that Poirot uses in Chapter 1 of ''Third Girl'', suggesting that the condemnation of fashion is authorial.{{Sfn | Christie | 2011c}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}} becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up-and-coming generation's young people. In ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', he investigates the strange goings on in a student hostel, while in ''Third Girl'' (1966) he is forced into contact with the smart set of Chelsea youths. In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties, he proves himself once again, but has become heavily reliant on other investigators (especially the [[private investigator]], Mr. Goby) who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself.\n{{Quote | ''You're too old''.

I'm really very sorry. | Norma Restarick to Poirot in ''Third Girl'', Chapter 1{{Sfn |Christie | 2011c|loc=Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}}\n\nNotably, during this time his physical characteristics also change dramatically, and by the time Arthur Hastings meets Poirot again in ''Curtain'', he looks very different from his previous appearances, having become thin with age and with obviously dyed hair.\n\n=== Death ===\n\nOn the ITV television series, Poirot died in October 1949<ref>The extensive letter addressed to Hastings where he explains how he solved the case is dated from October 1949 (\"Curtain\", 2013)</ref> from complications of a heart condition at the end of ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain: Poirot's Last Case]]''. This took place at Styles Court, scene of his first English case in 1916. In Christie's novels, he lived into the late 1960s, perhaps even until 1975 when ''Curtain'' was published. In both the novel and the television adaptation, he had moved his [[amyl nitrite]] pills out of his own reach, possibly because of guilt. He thereby became the murderer in ''Curtain'', although it was for the benefit of others. Poirot himself noted that he wanted to kill his victim shortly before his own death so that he could avoid succumbing to the arrogance of the murderer, concerned that he might come to view himself as entitled to kill those whom he deemed necessary to eliminate.\n\nThe \"murderer\" that he was hunting had never actually killed anyone, but he had manipulated others to kill for him, subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts as nothing more than a momentary passion. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself, as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted, as he did not legally do anything wrong. It is revealed at the end of ''Curtain'' that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from [[arthritis]], to give the impression that he is more infirm than he is. His last recorded words are \"''Cher ami!''\", spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room. (The TV adaptation adds that as Poirot is dying alone, he whispers out his final prayer to God in these words: \"Forgive me... forgive...\")<ref name=\"Suchet\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2506890/Poirot-finale-My-agony-Poirot-drew-breath-David-Suchet.html |title='My agony as Poirot drew out his last breath', by DAVID SUCHET: Shock as the little Belgian sensationally turns out to be the killer in his own final case (SPOILER) |last=Suchet |first=David |authorlink=David Suchet |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> Poirot was buried at Styles, and his funeral was arranged by his best friend Hastings and Hastings' daughter Judith. Hastings reasoned, \"Here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country. He was to lie here at the last.\"\n\nPoirot's actual death and funeral occurred in ''Curtain'', years after his retirement from active investigation, but it was not the first time that Hastings attended the funeral of his best friend. In ''The Big Four'' (1927), Poirot feigned his death and subsequent funeral to launch a surprise attack on the Big Four.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 16"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 17"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://magazine.bellesdemeures.com/en/luxury/lifestyle/province-hainaut-village-ellezelles-adopts-detective-hercule-poirot-article-27759.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "In the province of Hainaut, the village of Ellezelles adopts detective Hercule Poirot"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Belles Demeures"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en-gb"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "17 December 2018"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1947a"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1948"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 12"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1947c"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2009b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 15"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2009b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 15"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1975"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Postscript"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1939"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 7"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013b"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2012"}]}, {"name": "multiple image\n<!-- Layout -->\n ", "values": [{"name": "align", "value": "right"}, {"name": "direction", "value": "<!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->"}, {"name": "background color", "value": "<!-- box background -->"}, {"name": "total_width", "value": "<!-- total width of all the displayed images in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix) -->"}, {"name": "caption_align", "value": "<!-- left (default), center, right -->"}, {"name": "image1", "value": "Florin Court (2).jpg"}, {"name": "width1", "value": "200"}, {"name": "height1", "value": "200"}, {"name": "image2", "value": "Florin Court-13909277428.jpg"}, {"name": "width2", "value": "200"}, {"name": "height2", "value": "200"}, {"name": "footer", "value": "[[Florin Court]] became the fictional residence of Agatha Christie's Poirot, known as \"Whitehaven Mansions\""}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2012"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006a"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004a"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 13"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 18"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1952"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 4"}]}, {"name": "Quote ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "He, I knew, was not likely to be far from his headquarters.

As Poirot was often misleading about his past to gain information, the truthfulness of that statement is unknown; it does however scare off a would be killer of his wife.\n\nIn the short story [[Poirot's Early Cases#The Chocolate Box|\"The Chocolate Box\"]] (1923), Poirot reveals to [[Captain Arthur Hastings]] an account of what he considers to be his only failure. Poirot admits that he has failed to solve a crime \"innumerable\" times:\n\n<blockquote>I have been called in too late. Very often another, working towards the same goal, has arrived there first. Twice I have been struck down with illness just as I was on the point of success.</blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, he regards the 1893 case in \"The Chocolate Box\",<ref>The date is given in {{harvnb|Christie|2009b|loc=Chapter 15}}</ref> as his only actual failure of detection. Again, Poirot is not reliable as a narrator of his personal history and there is no evidence that Christie sketched it out in any depth. During his police career Poirot shot a man who was firing from a roof into the public below.{{sfn|Christie|1975|loc=Postscript}} In ''[[Lord Edgware Dies]]'', Poirot reveals that he learned to read writing upside down during his police career. Around that time he met Xavier Bouc, director of the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]]. Poirot also became a uniformed director, working on trains.\n\nInspector Japp offers some insight into Poirot's career with the Belgian police when introducing him to a colleague:\n\n<blockquote>You've heard me speak of Mr Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked together \u2013 the Abercrombie forgery case \u2013 you remember he was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were the days Moosier. Then, do you remember \"Baron\" Altara?

On 16 July 1916 he again met his lifelong friend, Captain Arthur Hastings, and solved the first of his cases to be published, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles''. It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel, as Hastings tells Cynthia that he has not seen him for \"some years\". Particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium, are given in ''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'', Chapter 1.  After that case, Poirot apparently came to the attention of the British secret service and undertook cases for the British government, including foiling the attempted abduction of the [[Prime Minister of Britain|Prime Minister]].<ref>Recounted in {{harvnb|Christie|2012}}</ref> Readers were told that the British authorities had learned of Poirot's keen investigative ability from certain members of [[Belgian Royal Family|Belgium's royal family]].\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = <!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->\n | background color  = <!-- box background -->\n | total_width       = <!-- total width of all the displayed images in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix) -->\n | caption_align     = <!-- left (default), center, right -->\n\n | image1            = Florin Court (2).jpg\n | width1            = 200\n | height1           = 200\n | alt1              = \n | link1             = \n | caption1          =\n\n | image2            = Florin Court-13909277428.jpg\n | width2            = 200\n | height2           = 200\n | alt2              = \n | link2             = \n | caption2          =\n\n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = \n | footer            = [[Florin Court]] became the fictional residence of Agatha Christie's Poirot, known as \"Whitehaven Mansions\"\n}}\nAfter the war Poirot became a private detective and began undertaking civilian cases. He moved into what became both his home and work address, Flat 203 at 56B Whitehaven Mansions. Hastings first visits the flat when he returns to England in June 1935 from Argentina in ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', Chapter 1. The TV programmes place this in [[Florin Court]], Charterhouse Square, in the wrong part of London.  According to Hastings, it was chosen by Poirot \"entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion\" and described as the \"newest type of service flat\". (The Florin Court building was actually built in 1936, decades after Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case in this period was \"The Affair at the Victory Ball\", which allowed Poirot to enter high society and begin his career as a private detective.\n\nBetween the world wars, Poirot travelled all over Europe, Africa, Asia, and half of South America investigating crimes and solving murders. Most of his cases occurred during this time and he was at the height of his powers at this point in his life. In ''The Murder on the Links'', the Belgian pits his grey cells against a French murderer. In the Middle East, he solved the cases ''Death on the Nile'' and ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' with ease and even survived ''An Appointment with Death''. As he passed through Eastern Europe on his return trip, he solved ''The Murder on the Orient Express''. However he did not travel to North America, the West Indies, the Caribbean or Oceania, probably to avoid sea sickness.\n\n<blockquote>It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The ''mal de mer'' \u2013 it is horrible suffering!<ref>Poirot, in {{harvnb|Christie|2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was during this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims to have been a member of the Russian aristocracy before the Russian Revolution and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of that story is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.<ref>Cassatis, John (1979). ''The Diaries of A. Christie''. London.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is the misfortune of small, precise men always to hanker after large and flamboyant women. Poirot had never been able to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the Countess held for him.<ref>\"The Capture of Cerebus\" (1947). The first sentence quoted is also a close paraphrase of something said to Poirot by Hastings in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''{{harvnb|Christie|2004b}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough letting the Countess escape was morally questionable, it was not uncommon. In ''The Nemean Lion'', Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, allowing her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare the feelings of the murderer's relatives. In ''The Augean Stables'', he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In ''Murder on the Orient Express'', Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder, each one stabbing the victim in a darkened carriage after drugging him into unconsciousness so that there is no way for anyone to definitively determine which of them actually delivered the killing blow. The victim had been committed a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of at least five people. There was no question of his guilt, but he had been acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternative sequence of events to explain the death involving an unknown additional passenger on the train, with the medical examiner agreeing to doctor his own report to support this theory.\n\nAfter his cases in the Middle East, Poirot returned to Britain. Apart from some of the so-called \"Labours of Hercules\" (see next section) he very rarely went abroad during his later career. He moved into Styles Court towards the end of his life.\n\nWhile Poirot was usually paid handsomely by clients, he was also known to take on cases that piqued his curiosity, although they did not pay well.\n\nPoirot shows a love of steam trains, which Christie contrasts with Hastings' love of autos: this is shown in ''[[Poirot's Early Cases|The Plymouth Express]]'', ''[[The Mystery of the Blue Train]]'', ''Murder on the Orient Express'', and ''The ABC Murders'' (in the TV series, steam trains are seen in nearly all of the episodes).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013b"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2012"}]}, {"name": "multiple image\n<!-- Layout -->\n ", "values": [{"name": "align", "value": "right"}, {"name": "direction", "value": "<!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->"}, {"name": "background color", "value": "<!-- box background -->"}, {"name": "total_width", "value": "<!-- total width of all the displayed images in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix) -->"}, {"name": "caption_align", "value": "<!-- left (default), center, right -->"}, {"name": "image1", "value": "Florin Court (2).jpg"}, {"name": "width1", "value": "200"}, {"name": "height1", "value": "200"}, {"name": "image2", "value": "Florin Court-13909277428.jpg"}, {"name": "width2", "value": "200"}, {"name": "height2", "value": "200"}, {"name": "footer", "value": "[[Florin Court]] became the fictional residence of Agatha Christie's Poirot, known as \"Whitehaven Mansions\""}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2012"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": " Retirement ", "paragraphs": "\n<blockquote>That\u2019s the way of it.

Most of the cases covered by Poirot's private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow [[Squash (plant)|marrows]], at which time he solves ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd''. It has been said that the twelve cases related in ''The Labours of Hercules'' (1947) must refer to a different retirement, but the fact that Poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before ''Roger Ackroyd'', and presumably Poirot closed his agency once he had completed them. There is specific mention in \"The Capture of Cerberus\" of the twenty-year gap between Poirot's previous meeting with Countess Rossakoff and this one. If the ''Labours'' precede the events in ''Roger Ackroyd'', then the Ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years ''later'' than it was published, and so must any of the cases that refer to it. One alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once, Poirot is determined to have another go, but this is specifically denied by Poirot himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2004a|loc=Chapter 13}} in response to the suggestion that he might take up gardening in his retirement, Poirot answers \"Once the vegetable marrows, yes \u2013 but never again\".</ref> Also, in \"The Erymanthian Boar\", a character is said to have been turned out of Austria by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], implying that the events of ''[[The Labours of Hercules]]'' took place after 1937. Another alternative would be to suggest that the Preface to the ''Labours'' takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years. None of the explanations is especially attractive.\n\nIn terms of a rudimentary chronology, Poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 18}} (1927) which places that novel out of published order before ''Roger Ackroyd''. He declines to solve a case for the Home Secretary because he is retired in Chapter One of ''Peril at End House'' (1932). He is certainly retired at the time of ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1935) but he does not enjoy his retirement and repeatedly takes cases thereafter when his curiosity is engaged. He continues to employ his secretary, Miss Lemon, at the time of the cases retold in ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' and ''Dead Man's Folly'', which take place in the mid-1950s. It is therefore better to assume that Christie provided no authoritative chronology for Poirot's retirement, but assumed that he could either be an active detective, a consulting detective, or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required.\n\nOne consistent element about Poirot's retirement is that his fame declines during it, so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters (especially younger characters) recognise neither him nor his name:\n\n<blockquote>\"I should, perhaps, Madame, tell you a little more about myself. I am ''Hercule Poirot''.\"<br/>\n\nThe revelation left Mrs Summerhayes unmoved.<br/>\n\n\"What a lovely name,\" she said kindly. \"Greek, isn't it?\"{{sfn|Christie|1952|loc=Chapter 4}}</blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006a"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004a"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 13"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004b"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 18"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1952"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Chapter 4"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": " Post\u2013World War II ", "paragraphs": "{{Quote | He, I knew, was not likely to be far from his headquarters.

Beginning with ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a subgenre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events. In novels such as ''Taken at the Flood'', ''[[After the Funeral]]'', and ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In ''Cat Among the Pigeons'', Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought. Whether this was a reflection of his age or of Christie's distaste for him, is impossible to assess. ''[[Crooked House]]'' (1949) and ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (1957), which could easily have been Poirot novels, represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works.\n\nTowards the end of his career, it becomes clear that Poirot's retirement is no longer a convenient fiction.  He assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels. He even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Wilkie Collins]].{{sfn|Christie | 2011c |loc =Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}  In the absence of a more appropriate puzzle, he solves such inconsequential domestic riddles as the presence of three pieces of orange peel in his umbrella stand.{{sfn|Christie | 2006a |loc=Chapter 14}} {{Page needed | date = August 2014}}\n\nPoirot (and, it is reasonable to suppose, his creator){{efn | In ''The Pale Horse'', Chapter 1, the novel's narrator, Mark Easterbrook, disapprovingly describes a typical \"Chelsea girl\"{{Sfn | Christie |1961}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} in much the same terms that Poirot uses in Chapter 1 of ''Third Girl'', suggesting that the condemnation of fashion is authorial.{{Sfn | Christie | 2011c}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}} becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up-and-coming generation's young people.

In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties, he proves himself once again, but has become heavily reliant on other investigators (especially the [[private investigator]], Mr. Goby) who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself.\n{{Quote | ''You're too old''.

This took place at Styles Court, scene of his first English case in 1916. In Christie's novels, he lived into the late 1960s, perhaps even until 1975 when ''Curtain'' was published. In both the novel and the television adaptation, he had moved his [[amyl nitrite]] pills out of his own reach, possibly because of guilt. He thereby became the murderer in ''Curtain'', although it was for the benefit of others. Poirot himself noted that he wanted to kill his victim shortly before his own death so that he could avoid succumbing to the arrogance of the murderer, concerned that he might come to view himself as entitled to kill those whom he deemed necessary to eliminate.\n\nThe \"murderer\" that he was hunting had never actually killed anyone, but he had manipulated others to kill for him, subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts as nothing more than a momentary passion. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself, as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted, as he did not legally do anything wrong. It is revealed at the end of ''Curtain'' that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from [[arthritis]], to give the impression that he is more infirm than he is. His last recorded words are \"''Cher ami!''\", spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room.
