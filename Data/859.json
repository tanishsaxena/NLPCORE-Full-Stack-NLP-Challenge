The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands. When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage, the Latins gave a contemptuous reply. Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins. The declaration is notable since, according to Livy, it was the first time that the Romans had declared war by means of the rites of the [[fetial]]s.<ref name=\"Livy1:32\"/>\n\nAncus Marcius marched from Rome with a newly levied army and took the Latin town of [[Politorium]] (situated near the town of [[Lanuvium]]) by storm. Its residents were removed to settle on the [[Aventine Hill]] in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the [[Sabines]] and [[Alba Longa|Albans]]. When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.<ref name=\"Livy1:33\"/> The Latin villages of Tellenae and Ficana were also sacked and demolished.\n\nThe war then focused on the Latin town of [[Medullia]]. The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified. Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious. Ancus returned to Rome with a large amount of loot. More Latins were brought to Rome as citizens and were settled at the foot of the Aventine near the [[Palatine Hill]], by the temple of [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]]. \nAncus Marcius incorporated the [[Janiculum]] into the city, fortifying it with a wall and connecting it with the city by a wooden bridge across the [[Tiber]],<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ancus Marcius|volume=1|page=953}}</ref> the [[Pons Sublicius]].  \nOn the land side of the city he constructed the [[Fossa Quiritium]], a ditch fortification.
