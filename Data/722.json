Met. 9.273\" />\n\nThere are two accounts of Alcmene's death. In the first, according to the Megarians, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when she died at [[Megara]]. The [[Heracleidae]] fell into disagreement about where to take Alcmene's body, with some wishing to take her corpse back to Argos, and others wishing to take it to Thebes to be buried with Amphitryon and Heracles' children by [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. However, the god in [[Delphi]] gave the Heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury Alcmene in Megara.<ref name=\"Paus. 1.41.1\">Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.41.1 1.41.1]</ref> In the second account given by the Thebans, when Alcmene died, she was turned from human form to a stone.<ref name=\"Paus. 9.16.7\">Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.16.7 9.16.7]</ref>\n\nPausanias indicated that an altar to Alcmene had been built in the [[Cynosarges]] in Athens, alongside altars to Heracles, [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], and [[Iolaus]].<ref name=\"Paus. 1.19.3\">Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.19.3 1.19.3]</ref> Pausanias also said that Alcmene's tomb is located near the Olympieum at Megara.<ref name=\"Paus. 1.41.1\" />\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": "Notes", "paragraphs": "{{Commons category|Alcmene}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Commons category", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Alcmene"}]}, {"name": "reflist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "30em"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "*[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]].
