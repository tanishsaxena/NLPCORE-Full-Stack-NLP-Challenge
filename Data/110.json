Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]].\n\nAccording to Orwell, the [[fable]] reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u201353)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}}{{sfn|Meija|2002}}  Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and \"Spilling the Spanish Beans\", ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[great purge|a reign of terror]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (\"''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''\"),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay \"[[Why I Write]]\" (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}}\n\nThe original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,'' but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like \"A Satire\" and \"A Contemporary Satire\".{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for \"bear\", a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}\n\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]] and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=&nbsp;vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}}\n\n''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]].{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} It won a [[Retro-Hugo|Retrospective Hugo Award]] in 1996{{Sfn|The Hugo Awards|1996}} and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.<ref name=\"Western books\">{{Cite web|url=https://prodigalnomore.wordpress.com/great-books-of-the-western-world-as-free-ebooks/ |website=prodigalnomore.wordpress.com|title=Great Books of the Western World as Free eBooks|date=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the novel by George Orwell"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Novel by George Orwell"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2017"}]}, {"name": "Use British English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2011"}]}, {"name": "Infobox book\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Animal Farm"}, {"name": "title_orig", "value": "Animal Farm: A Fairy Story"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Animal Farm -

One night, the exalted boar [[Old Major]] organizes a meeting, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called \"[[Beasts of England]]\". When Old Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property \"Animal Farm\". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, \"All animals are equal\". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]]. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the \"Battle of the Cowshed\"), Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]]. Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and he declares himself leader.\n\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project, and begin to [[purge]] the farm of animals Napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Mr. Jones, while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. \"Beasts of England\" is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.\n\nMr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer the workhorse]], are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). Boxer is taken away in a [[knacker]]'s van, but Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and martyrizes him with a festival the following day. However, the truth is that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing Napoleon and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves.\n\n{{anchor|moreEqual}}\nYears pass, the windmill is rebuilt, and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones, having moved away after giving up on reclaiming his farm, has also died. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: ''\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"'' and the maxim ''\"Four legs good, two legs bad.\"'' is changed to ''\"Four legs good, two legs better.\"'' Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name \"The Manor Farm\". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the [[Ace of spades|Ace of Spades]] at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "moreEqual"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Characters", "paragraphs": "\n===Pigs===\n\n*[[Old Major]] \u2013 An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion.

The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill.

Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and worried that this could also happen to him.\n*Mr. Whymper \u2013 A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society.

He is shown to hold the belief that \"Napoleon is always right.\" At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to [[Alexey Stakhanov]], a diligent and enthusiastic role model of the [[Stakhanovite movement]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=12}} He has been described as \"faithful and strong\";{{sfn|Sutherland|2005|pp=17\u201319}} he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.{{sfn|Roper|1977|pp=11\u201363}} When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying Boxer's death.\n*Mollie \u2013 A self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters/|title=Animal Farm Characters|last=SparkNotes Editors.|date=2007|website=SparkNotes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> She is only once mentioned again.\n*Clover \u2013 A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard.

He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called \"Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!\" Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as \"the black raven of priestcraft\u2014promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.\" Napoleon brings the Raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p= 141}}\n*The sheep \u2013 They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless they are the voice of blind conformity{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p=141}} as they bleat their support Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad\" was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternate views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=122}} Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to \"four legs good, two legs better,\" which they dutifully do.\n*The hens \u2013 The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones. However, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm.

Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments.

The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets'''.</li>\n<li>No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess'''.</li>\n<li>No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause'''.</li>\n</ol>\nEventually, these are replaced with the maxims, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\", and \"Four legs good, two legs better\" as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits.
