Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1

Within four years protected areas doubled and now makeup eight percent of the country's territory.

This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.<ref name=\"KL\"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].\n\nThe [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the major rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur\u2013Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.\n\n[[Yanar Dag]], translated as \"burning mountain\", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Baku]], which itself is known as the \"land of fire.\" Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer.

The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.\n\nThe Constitution of Azerbaijan states that it is a presidential republic with three branches of power \u2013 Executive, Legislative and Judicial. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Parliament of Azerbaijan, called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies and elected based on the majority voting system, with a term of 5 years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Parliament is not responsible for the formation of the government, but the Constitution requires the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers by Milli Majlis<ref>(Constitution of Azerbaijan Republic, Articles 104-107).</ref> The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats.

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan is determined by the Provision on Local Executive Authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.
