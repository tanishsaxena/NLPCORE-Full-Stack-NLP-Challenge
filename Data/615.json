However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to \"primitive\" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of \"savage\" people and Westerners.<ref name=stringer />\n\nTylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as \"spiritualism\" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term \"animism\" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67\u2013S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that there had once been \"one universal form of primitive religion\" (whether labelled \"animism\", \"totemism\", or \"shamanism\") has been dismissed as \"unsophisticated\" and \"erroneous\" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that \"it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants\".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}\n\n==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====\nTylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of \"primitive society\" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on \"primitive society\" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The \"19th-century armchair anthropologists\" argued \"primitive society\" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of \"developed\" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented \"survivals\" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = The term [\"animism\"] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.<ref name=\"Kuper 2005 85\" /> Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists \"have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]].\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\">{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.<ref>Ingold, Tim.

He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}\n\nIn 2000, Guthrie suggested that the \"most widespread\" concept of animism was that it was the \"attribution of spirits to natural phenomena\nsuch as stones and trees\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}\n\n=== The new animism ===\n\nMany anthropologists ceased using the term \"animism\", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups \u2013 namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers \u2013 who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as \"animists\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the \"old animist\" definition had been problematic, the term \"animism\" was nevertheless \"of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world.\"{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}\n\n[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the \"new animism\".]]\nThe \"new animism\" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to \"act as a person\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}\n\nHallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist [[Nurit Bird-David]], who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}\n\nMore recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to \"animate\" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our \"professional subcultures,\" which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are \"approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22\u20134|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}</ref> These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\" />\n\nNurit Bird-David argues that \"Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\" /> She argues that animism is a \"relational epistemology\", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the \"individual\"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships (\"dividuals\"), some of which are with \"superpersons\" (i.e. non-humans).\n\nGuthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that \"the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it\". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning \"the scientific project\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}\n\nTim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: \"Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&nbsp; ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}</ref> Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, \"feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}</ref> The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}</ref> [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.\n\nCultural ecologist and philosopher [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively \"solicit our attention\" or \"call our focus,\" coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.<ref>Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}</ref>  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us\u2014we 'see what they say'\u2014much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. \"To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/303 303]}}</ref>\n\nThe religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief \"that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore \"concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}\nGraham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's \"I-thou\" as opposed to \"I-it\".

Murray| isbn = | page = 260 }}</ref> a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. That formulation was little different from that proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] as \"[[fetishism]]\",<ref name=\"Kuper 2005 85\">{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Reinvention of Primitive Society: Transformations of a Myth (2nd Edition)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY, USA|page=85}}</ref> but the terms now have distinct meanings.\n\nFor Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}}\nThus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}} He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but he suggested that it arose from early humans' dreams and visions and thus was a rational system. However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to \"primitive\" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of \"savage\" people and Westerners.<ref name=stringer />\n\nTylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as \"spiritualism\" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term \"animism\" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67\u2013S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that there had once been \"one universal form of primitive religion\" (whether labelled \"animism\", \"totemism\", or \"shamanism\") has been dismissed as \"unsophisticated\" and \"erroneous\" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that \"it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants\".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}\n\n==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====\nTylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of \"primitive society\" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on \"primitive society\" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The \"19th-century armchair anthropologists\" argued \"primitive society\" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of \"developed\" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented \"survivals\" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = The term [\"animism\"] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.<ref name=\"Kuper 2005 85\" /> Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists \"have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]].\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\">{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.<ref>Ingold, Tim.

By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on \"primitive society\" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The \"19th-century armchair anthropologists\" argued \"primitive society\" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of \"developed\" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented \"survivals\" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = The term [\"animism\"] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to \"animate\" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our \"professional subcultures,\" which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are \"approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22\u20134|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}</ref> These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\" />\n\nNurit Bird-David argues that \"Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts.

That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the \"individual\"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships (\"dividuals\"), some of which are with \"superpersons\" (i.e. non-humans).\n\nGuthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that \"the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it\". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning \"the scientific project\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}\n\nTim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: \"Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&nbsp; ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}</ref> Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, \"feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}</ref> The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}</ref> [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.\n\nCultural ecologist and philosopher [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively \"solicit our attention\" or \"call our focus,\" coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.<ref>Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}</ref>  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us\u2014we 'see what they say'\u2014much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. \"To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/303 303]}}</ref>\n\nThe religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief \"that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore \"concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}\nGraham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's \"I-thou\" as opposed to \"I-it\".
