At the time, the written standard was ''Oberdeutsche Schreibsprache'', which was highly influenced by the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] and [[Alemannic dialects]] of Austria. Another option was to create a new standard based on the Southern German dialects, as proposed by the linguist [[Johann Siegmund Popowitsch]]. Instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already standardized Chancellery language of Saxony (''S\u00e4chsische Kanzleisprache'' or ''Mei\u00dfner Kanzleideutsch''), which was based on the administrative language of the non-Austrian area of [[Mei\u00dfen]] and [[Dresden]].\nThus Standard Austrian German has the same geographic origin as the [[German Standard German]] (''Bundesdeutsches Hochdeutsch'') and [[Swiss High German]] (''Schweizer Hochdeutsch'', not to be confused with the Alemannic [[Swiss German]] dialects).\n\nThe process of introducing the new written standard was led by [[Joseph von Sonnenfels]].\nSince 1951 the standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools has been defined by the ''[[Austrian Dictionary]]'' (''{{lang|de|\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch}}''), published under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "de"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "General situation of German", "paragraphs": "As [[German language|German]] is a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian German is one among several [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Standard German.

A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in ''Markhardt, Heidemarie: W\u00f6rterbuch der \u00f6sterreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie'' (Peter Lang, 2006).\n\n===Former spoken standard===\nThe former standard, used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language, was the ''{{lang|de|Sch\u00f6nbrunner Deutsch}}'', a sociolect spoken by the imperial [[Habsburg family]] and the nobility of [[Austria-Hungary]].

This form is known as ''{{lang|de|\u00d6sterreichische Kanzleisprache}}'', or \"Austrian chancellery language\". It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from medieval deeds and documents, and has a very complex structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents. For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic, internal, official, and military matters. There are no regional variations, because this special written form has mainly been used by a government that has now for centuries been based in Vienna.\n\n''{{lang|de|\u00d6sterreichische Kanzleisprache}}'' is now used less and less, thanks to various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants (''{{lang|de|[[Beamter|Beamte]]}}''). As a result, Standard German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.\n\n===European Union===\nWhen Austria became a member of the [[European Union]], 23 food-related terms were listed in its accession agreement as having the same legal status as the equivalent terms used in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:1994:241:TOC |title= Documents concerning the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Norway to the European Union |accessdate= 24 October 2015 |date= 29 August 1994 |work= European Commission |page= 370 |quote= The specific Austrian terms of the German language contained in the Austrian legal order and listed in the Annex to this Protocol shall have the same status and may be used with the same legal effect as the corresponding terms used in Germany listed in that Annex.}}</ref> Austrian German is the only variety of a [[pluricentric language]] recognized under international law or EU primary law.<ref>Markhardt's ''Das \u00f6sterreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU'', Peter Lang, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Grammar===\n\n====Verbs====\nIn [[Austria]], as in the [[languages of Switzerland#German|German-speaking parts of Switzerland]] and in [[southern Germany]], verbs that express a state tend to use ''{{lang|de|sein}}'' as the [[auxiliary verb]] in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], as well as verbs of movement. [[Verb]]s which fall into this category include ''sitzen'' (to sit), ''liegen'' (to lie) and, in parts of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], ''schlafen'' (to sleep). Therefore, the perfect of these verbs would be ''ich bin gesessen'', ''ich bin gelegen'' and ''ich bin geschlafen'' respectively (note: ''ich bin geschlafen'' is a rarely used form, more commonly ''ich habe geschlafen'' is used).\n\nIn Germany, the words ''stehen'' (to stand) and ''gestehen'' (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: ''habe gestanden''. The Austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity (''bin gestanden'' from ''stehen'', \"to stand\"; and ''habe gestanden'' from ''gestehen'', \"to confess\", e.g. ''\"der Verbrecher ist vor dem Richter gestanden und hat gestanden\"'').\n\nIn addition, the [[preterite]] ([[simple past]]) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the [[spoken language]], with the exception of some modal verbs (i.e. ''ich sollte'', ''ich wollte'').\n\n===Vocabulary===\nThere are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of [[Germany]]. Words primarily used in Austria are ''J\u00e4nner'' (January) rather than ''Januar'', ''Feber'' (February) rather than ''Februar'', ''heuer'' (this year) rather than ''dieses Jahr'', ''Stiege'' (stairs) instead of ''Treppe'', ''Rauchfang'' (chimney) instead of ''Schornstein'', many administrative, legal and political terms, and many food terms, including the following:<ref>Otto Back, Erich Benedikt, Karl Bl\u00fcml, et al.: \u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch (neue Rechtschreibung).
