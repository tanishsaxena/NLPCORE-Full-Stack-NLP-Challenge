Such statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's [[signature]] by a taker of oaths, such as a [[notary public]] or commissioner of oaths. An affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, meaning it is under oath or penalty of [[perjury]], and this serves as evidence to its veracity and is required for court proceedings.\n\nAffidavits may be written in the first or third person, depending on who drafted the document. The document's component parts are typically as follows:\n* a ''commencement'' which identifies the \"affiant of truth\",<ref>[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Affiant.aspx Legal Dictionary] retrieved on 11 October 2012</ref> generally stating that everything in it is true, under penalty of perjury, fine, or imprisonment;\n* an ''attestation'' clause, usually a [[jurat (clause)|jurat]], at the end certifying that the affiant made oath and the date;\n* signatures of the author and witness.\n\nIf an affidavit is notarized or authenticated, it will also include a caption with a venue and title in reference to judicial proceedings. In some cases, an introductory clause, called a ''preamble'', is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "audio", "value": "LL-Q1860 (eng)-Back ache-affidavit.wav"}, {"name": "1", "value": "\u02cc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6"}, {"name": "3", "value": "f"}, {"name": "4", "value": "\u026a"}, {"name": "5", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "6", "value": "d"}, {"name": "7", "value": "e\u026a"}, {"name": "8", "value": "v"}, {"name": "9", "value": "\u026a"}, {"name": "10", "value": "t"}]}, {"name": "Respell", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "AF"}, {"name": "2", "value": "i"}, {"name": "3", "value": "DAY"}, {"name": "4", "value": "vit"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Australia", "paragraphs": "On 2 March 2016, the High Court of Australia held that the ACT Uniform Evidence Legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Queen v GW [2016] HCA 6|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2016/6.html|accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Queen v GW [2016] HCA 6"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2016/6.html"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "6 March 2016"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "India", "paragraphs": "In Indian law, although an affidavit may be taken as proof of the facts stated therein, the courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit.

Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear, may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of [[corroborating evidence]]. An affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness's recollection. Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence. If the affiant is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nAffidavits are typically included in the response to [[interrogatories]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_33 Rule 33.

One party may wish to summon the affiant to verify the contents of the affidavit, while the other party may want to cross-examine the affiant about the affidavit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://legalvision.com.au/what-is-an-affidavit/|title=What is an Affidavit? &#124; Meaning of Affidavit in Law|date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence in support of the need for the motion. In such a case, a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit: The affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes [[judicial economy]]. The lawyer is an [[officer of the court]] and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including [[disbarment]]. The lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit.\n\nThe acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions. Equally, the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court (for swearing the affidavit) is not a given. This matter is addressed by the use of the apostille, a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the [[Apostille Convention|1961 Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents]]. Documents which have been notarized by a notary public, and certain other documents, and then certified with a conformant apostille, are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the Hague Convention. Thus most affidavits now require to be apostilled if used for cross border issues.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Naar"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Alan S."}, {"name": "year", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://greenbaumlaw.com/Rsc_FilesView.asp?fileCode=593P37E22I44"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Requests for Admission: an underutilized litigation tool"}, {"name": "work", "value": "New Jersey Lawyer, the Magazine"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "14 July 2013"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100121045431/http://greenbaumlaw.com/Rsc_FilesView.asp?fileCode=593P37E22I44"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "21 January 2010"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://legalvision.com.au/what-is-an-affidavit/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "What is an Affidavit? &#124; Meaning of Affidavit in Law"}, {"name": "date", "value": "24 May 2017"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Types of affidavit", "paragraphs": "\nThere are various occasions or circumstances when a person needs an affidavit for a specific purpose and for that reason there are multiple  as listed below:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afidavit.com/affidavit-definition-of-affidavit-affidavit-types-affidavit-purpose-how-to-write-an-affidavit/|title=Affidavit - Definition of Affidavit - Affidavit Types - Affidavit Purpose - How to write an Affidavit?|date=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n* Affidavit of Death\n* Affidavit of Heirship\n* Affidavit of Identity Theft\n* Affidavit of Name Change\n* Affidavit of Small Estate\n* Affidavit of Support\n* Affidavit of Residence\n* Affidavit of Service\n* Divorce Affidavit\n* Financial Affidavit\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://afidavit.com/affidavit-definition-of-affidavit-affidavit-types-affidavit-purpose-how-to-write-an-affidavit/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Affidavit - Definition of Affidavit - Affidavit Types - Affidavit Purpose - How to write an Affidavit?"}, {"name": "date", "value": "8 September 2018"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "* [[Declaration (law)]]\n* [[Deposition (law)]]\n* [[Fishman Affidavit]], a well-known example of an affidavit\n* [[Performativity]]\n* [[Statutory declaration]]\n* [[Sworn declaration]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 7}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category-inline|Affidavits}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n[[Category:Evidence law]]\n[[Category:Legal documents]]\n[[Category:Notary]]", "attributes": [{"name": "Commons category-inline", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Affidavits"}]}], "id": 8}]}
