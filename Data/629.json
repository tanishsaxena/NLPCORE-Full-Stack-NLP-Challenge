The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcian, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458, protesting about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against [[Severus of Antioch]] and others.
