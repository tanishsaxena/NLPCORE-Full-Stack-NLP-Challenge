[[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]]\n\n'''Alabaster''' is a [[mineral]] or rock that is soft, often used for carving, and is processed for [[plaster]] powder. Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from [[geologist]]s. The former use is in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of [[gypsum]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/science/gypsum  ''Gypsum'', Britannica, retrieved 8 January 2017]</ref> and the fine-grained banded type of [[calcite]].<ref name=\"OxfMuseum\">''More about alabaster and travertine'', brief guide explaining the different use of these words by geologists, archaeologists, and those in the stone trade.

They are usually lightly colored, translucent, and soft stones. They have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts.<ref name=\"Grove\">\"Grove\": R. W.

Modern alabaster is probably [[calcite]] but may be either. Both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water. They have been used for making a variety of indoor artwork and carving, and they will not survive long outdoors.\n\nThe two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses: gypsum alabaster is so soft that a fingernail scratches it ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2), while calcite cannot be scratched in this way (Mohs hardness 3), although it yields to a knife.

[[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age.

The new industry prospered, but the reduced need of skilled craftsmen left only few still working. The 19th century brought a boom to the industry, largely due to the \"traveling artisans\" who went and offered their wares to the palaces of Europe, as well as to America and the East.<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/>\n\nIn the 19th century new processing technology was also introduced, allowing for the production of custom-made, unique pieces, as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials.<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/> Apart from the newly developed craft, artistic work became again possible, chiefly by Volterran sculptor [[Albino Funaioli]].<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/> After a short slump, the industry was revived again by the sale of mass-produced mannerist [[Expressionist]] sculptures, and was further enhanced in the 1920s by a new branch creating ceiling and wall lamps in the [[Art Deco]] style and culminating in the participation at the 1925 [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] from [[Paris]].<ref name=\"BruciHist\"/> Important names from the evolution of alabaster use after [[World War II]] are Volterran [[Umberto Borgna]], the \"first alabaster designer\", and later on the architect and [[industrial design]]er [[Angelo Mangiarotti]].<ref>[http://www.toscana900.com/en/museo/ecomuseo-dellalabastro/][[:it:Ecomuseo dell'alabastro]]<span>, Volterra; official website</span></ref>\n\n====England and Wales====\n[[File:English - Resurrection - Walters 27308.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Resurrection of Christ]], typical [[Nottingham alabaster]] panel from an altarpiece set, 1450\u20131490, with remains of the paint]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Henry IV of England]] -->\nGypsum alabaster is a common mineral, which occurs in England in the [[Keuper]] [[marl]]s of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], especially at [[Chellaston]] in [[Derbyshire]], at Fauld in [[Staffordshire]], and near [[Newark, England|Newark]] in [[Nottinghamshire]].

These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble. After the [[English Reformation]] the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued, but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued.\n\nBesides examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]], and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]], Spain, and Scandinavia.\n\nAlabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere. In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or \"floors\" in spheroidal masses known as \"balls\" or \"bowls\" and in smaller lenticular masses termed \"cakes\".

These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble.
