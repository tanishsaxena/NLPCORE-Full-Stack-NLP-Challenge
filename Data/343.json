[[Hercule Poirot]], who became a long-running character in Christie's works, appearing in 33 novels and 54 short stories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hercule Poirot Reading

Although Christie states that, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", her autobiography does establish a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's maternal great-aunt Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\"){{Refn|Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller n\u00e9e West was complex. From the information provided earlier in the article it can be seen that as well as Christie's maternal great-aunt, Miller was Christie's father's step-mother as well as Christie's mother's foster mother and step-mother-in-law \u2013 hence the appellation \"Auntie-Grannie\".|group=lower-alpha}} and her \"Ealing cronies\".<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|422\u2013423}}<ref name =BBCdustyClues>{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Selina|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7612000/7612534.stm|title=Dusty clues to Christie unearthed|publisher=BBC News|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right.\"<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|422}} Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'', intended as the last cases of these two great detectives, Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1027804732|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=0008255784|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series\u2014for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released a second Poirot mystery, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\nChristie's reputation as \"The Queen of Crime\" was built upon the large number of classic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that she introduced, or for which she provided the most famous example. Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'').\n\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'').<ref name=me>Mezei, Kathy. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4619330 \"Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll\"], ''The Journal of Modern Literature'' 30.2 (2007): 103\u2013120</ref><ref name=be>Beehler, Sharon A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/818612 \"Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues\"], ''The English Journal'' 77.6 (1998): 39\u201343</ref>\n\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of their plot, sometimes by their own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''. In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\n\nIn ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the [[Billy Wilder]] film from 1957.) In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim.\n\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''. According to [[P. D. James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=P.D.|title=Talking About Detective Fiction|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-307-39882-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.<ref name=\"Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> However, John Curran describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making|last=Curran|first=John|publisher=Harper-Collins|year=2009|isbn=978-0-06-200652-3|location=London, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Titles ====\nChristie's mature novels, from 1940 onwards, often have titles drawn from literature.\n\nFour are from [[Shakespeare]]: \n* ''[[Sad Cypress]]'' from a song in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'': \"Come away, come away, death / And in sad cypress let me be laid\".\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' from Act 4, Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'' : \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes\".\n* ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide...]]'' (later ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'') from Brutus' speech in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'': \"There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\".\n* ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'' from Sonnet 98: \"From you have I been absent in the spring&nbsp;...\"\n\nThree are from the Bible: \n* ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:13 (and restated in 6:1): \"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt\".\n* ''[[The Burden]]'' from Jesus' words: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me&nbsp;... For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" (Matthew: 11: 29\u201330).\n* ''[[The Pale Horse]]'' from the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation of St John]] (6:8): \"I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death &nbsp;...\".\n\nAnother six are from other works of literature:\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' from [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Lady of Shalott]]\": \"Out flew the web, and floated wide/The mirror cracked from side to side/'The curse is come upon me,\" cried/The Lady of Shalott\"\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' from verse 51 of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'': \"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ/Moves on&nbsp;...\" This, in turn, refers to the Biblical account of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel, chapter 5), which is the origin of the expression \"the writing on the wall\".\n* ''[[The Rose and the Yew Tree]]'' from Section V of \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" from [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Four Quartets]]'': \"The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree/Are of equal duration\".\n* ''[[Postern of Fate]]'' from the poem \"Gates of Damascus\" by [[James Elroy Flecker]]: \"Postern of Fate, the Desert Gate, Disaster's Cavern, Fort of Fear/The Portal of Bagdad am I&nbsp;...\"\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' from [[William Blake]]'s [[Auguries of Innocence]]: \"Some are born to sweet delight / Some are born to endless night\".\n* ''[[N or M?]]'' from the [[Catechism]] in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] which asks, \"What is your Christian name?

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the novel.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans.  For example, she described \"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \"sallow men\" wearing same.\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates. The [[Fulbright scholar]] Sally Finch (''Hickory Dickory'' ''Death'', also published as ''Hickory Dickory Dock'') is intelligent, attractive and innocent, even though Mrs. Nicoletis automatically assumes she will object to sharing house with students of other races. Another (foreign) student falsely labels Sally as being a fanatical anti-Communist simply because she is American (the book was written just after the McCarthy period, in 1955).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/999441027|title=Hickory Dickory Dock|last=Christie |first=Agatha|date=2017|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=0008255539|oclc=999441027}}</ref> Anthony Browne (in ''Sparkling Cyanide'', also titled ''Remembered Death''), whom the book depicts as probably American, is suspected of being a spy.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1027804732|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=0008255784|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''.

This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series\u2014for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier.

Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'').\n\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'').<ref name=me>Mezei, Kathy. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4619330 \"Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll\"], ''The Journal of Modern Literature'' 30.2 (2007): 103\u2013120</ref><ref name=be>Beehler, Sharon A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/818612 \"Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues\"], ''The English Journal'' 77.6 (1998): 39\u201343</ref>\n\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of their plot, sometimes by their own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''. In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\n\nIn ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the [[Billy Wilder]] film from 1957.) In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim.\n\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''. According to [[P. D. James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=P.D.|title=Talking About Detective Fiction|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-307-39882-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.<ref name=\"Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> However, John Curran describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making|last=Curran|first=John|publisher=Harper-Collins|year=2009|isbn=978-0-06-200652-3|location=London, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Titles ====\nChristie's mature novels, from 1940 onwards, often have titles drawn from literature.\n\nFour are from [[Shakespeare]]: \n* ''[[Sad Cypress]]'' from a song in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'': \"Come away, come away, death / And in sad cypress let me be laid\".\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' from Act 4, Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'' : \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes\".\n* ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide...]]'' (later ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'') from Brutus' speech in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'': \"There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\".\n* ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'' from Sonnet 98: \"From you have I been absent in the spring&nbsp;...\"\n\nThree are from the Bible: \n* ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:13 (and restated in 6:1): \"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt\".\n* ''[[The Burden]]'' from Jesus' words: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me&nbsp;... For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" (Matthew: 11: 29\u201330).\n* ''[[The Pale Horse]]'' from the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation of St John]] (6:8): \"I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death &nbsp;...\".\n\nAnother six are from other works of literature:\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' from [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Lady of Shalott]]\": \"Out flew the web, and floated wide/The mirror cracked from side to side/'The curse is come upon me,\" cried/The Lady of Shalott\"\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' from verse 51 of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'': \"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ/Moves on&nbsp;...\" This, in turn, refers to the Biblical account of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel, chapter 5), which is the origin of the expression \"the writing on the wall\".\n* ''[[The Rose and the Yew Tree]]'' from Section V of \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" from [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Four Quartets]]'': \"The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree/Are of equal duration\".\n* ''[[Postern of Fate]]'' from the poem \"Gates of Damascus\" by [[James Elroy Flecker]]: \"Postern of Fate, the Desert Gate, Disaster's Cavern, Fort of Fear/The Portal of Bagdad am I&nbsp;...\"\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' from [[William Blake]]'s [[Auguries of Innocence]]: \"Some are born to sweet delight / Some are born to endless night\".\n* ''[[N or M?]]'' from the [[Catechism]] in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] which asks, \"What is your Christian name?

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the novel.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans.  For example, she described \"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \"sallow men\" wearing same.\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates. The [[Fulbright scholar]] Sally Finch (''Hickory Dickory'' ''Death'', also published as ''Hickory Dickory Dock'') is intelligent, attractive and innocent, even though Mrs. Nicoletis automatically assumes she will object to sharing house with students of other races. Another (foreign) student falsely labels Sally as being a fanatical anti-Communist simply because she is American (the book was written just after the McCarthy period, in 1955).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/999441027|title=Hickory Dickory Dock|last=Christie |first=Agatha|date=2017|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=0008255539|oclc=999441027}}</ref> Anthony Browne (in ''Sparkling Cyanide'', also titled ''Remembered Death''), whom the book depicts as probably American, is suspected of being a spy.

Although Christie states that, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", her autobiography does establish a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's maternal great-aunt Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\"){{Refn|Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller n\u00e9e West was complex.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1027804732|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=0008255784|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series\u2014for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released a second Poirot mystery, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Hercule Poirot Reading List"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://agatha-christie-cms-production.s3.amazonaws.com/archive/pdfs/poirot-reading-list.pdf"}, {"name": "website", "value": "AgathaChristie.com"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Agatha Christie Limited"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "19 January 2017"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160328003939/http://agatha-christie-cms-production.s3.amazonaws.com/archive/pdfs/poirot-reading-list.pdf"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "28 March 2016"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "Refn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller n\u00e9e West was complex.

Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'').\n\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'').<ref name=me>Mezei, Kathy. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4619330 \"Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll\"], ''The Journal of Modern Literature'' 30.2 (2007): 103\u2013120</ref><ref name=be>Beehler, Sharon A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/818612 \"Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues\"], ''The English Journal'' 77.6 (1998): 39\u201343</ref>\n\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of their plot, sometimes by their own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''. In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\n\nIn ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the [[Billy Wilder]] film from 1957.) In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim.\n\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''. According to [[P. D. James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=P.D.|title=Talking About Detective Fiction|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-307-39882-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.<ref name=\"Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archivedate=11 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> However, John Curran describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making|last=Curran|first=John|publisher=Harper-Collins|year=2009|isbn=978-0-06-200652-3|location=London, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2016"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "James"}, {"name": "first", "value": "P.D."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Talking About Detective Fiction"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Random House]]"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-307-39882-X"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "31 August 2013"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml"}, {"name": "title", "value": "BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Aldiss"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Brian"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "BBC"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "22 February 2009"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "11 February 2009"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Curran"}, {"name": "first", "value": "John"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Harper-Collins"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-06-200652-3"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London, UK"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": " Titles ", "paragraphs": "Christie's mature novels, from 1940 onwards, often have titles drawn from literature.\n\nFour are from [[Shakespeare]]: \n* ''[[Sad Cypress]]'' from a song in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'': \"Come away, come away, death / And in sad cypress let me be laid\".\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' from Act 4, Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'' : \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes\".\n* ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide...]]'' (later ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'') from Brutus' speech in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'': \"There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\".\n* ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'' from Sonnet 98: \"From you have I been absent in the spring&nbsp;...\"\n\nThree are from the Bible: \n* ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:13 (and restated in 6:1): \"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt\".\n* ''[[The Burden]]'' from Jesus' words: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me&nbsp;...

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites.

One such site featured in her work is the temple site of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile'', while many minor characters were archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations. The characters in this book in particular are also based on archaeologists whom Christie knew from her personal experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area. The death itself occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and offers some very descriptive details of sites which Christie herself could have visited to write the book.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote box\n", "values": [{"name": "align", "value": "right"}, {"name": "width", "value": "30%"}, {"name": "source", "value": "<ref name=\"Auto1993\"/>{{rp|364}}"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "The lure of the past came up to grab me.

Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile'', while many minor characters were archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations. The characters in this book in particular are also based on archaeologists whom Christie knew from her personal experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area. The death itself occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and offers some very descriptive details of sites which Christie herself could have visited to write the book.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 21}, {"title": "Portrayals in fiction", "paragraphs": "Christie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|url=https://www.amazon.com/London-Blitz-Murders-Allan-Collins/dp/0425198057|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).
