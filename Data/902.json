figures in the history of bodybuilding,<ref name=\":0\" /> and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.\n\nFor many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a [[conflict of interest]] since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of [[dietary supplement]]s in California.<ref name=\"megerian\">Megerian, Chris.

His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4&nbsp;\u2013 [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [England], 1&nbsp;\u2013 [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.\n\nSchwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 [[Arnold Classic]] he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc |title=Ask Arnold Training Seminar \u2013 Arnold Schwarzenegger Talks Bodybuilding Advice \u2013 Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220212802/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Powerlifting/weightlifting===\nDuring Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several [[Olympic weightlifting]] and [[powerlifting]] contests.

However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.<ref name=\"mrever\" />\n\nHe continued his winning streak in the 1971\u201374 competitions.<ref name=\"mrever\" /> In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,<ref name=\"mrever\" /> beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.<ref name=\"mrever\" />\n\nMonths before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. Although significantly taller and heavier, [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\n\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.<ref name=\"lifeline\" /> Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.<ref name=\"mrever\" />\n\nHe continued his winning streak in the 1971\u201374 competitions.<ref name=\"mrever\" /> In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,<ref name=\"mrever\" /> beating [[Franco Columbu]].

Although significantly taller and heavier, [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\n\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.<ref name=\"lifeline\" /> Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''.

This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman & Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office.

In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor.<ref name=\"thereporter1\"/> Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a bipartisan bill that allows offender's victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days notice for any commutations.<ref>{{cite web |last=McGreevy |first=Patrick |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/04/local/la-me-brown-legislation-20111004 |title=Gov.
