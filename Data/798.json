Alfonso was monarch from birth as his father, [[Alfonso XII]], had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.\n\nDuring Alfonso's reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the [[Rif War]]; and [[Catalan nationalism]]. The political and social turbulence that began with the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true [[liberal democracy]], which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime. Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.\n\nHe left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite on abolishing the monarchy.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2018"}]}, {"name": "Infobox

He was the posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the Spanish prime minister on a silver tray.\n\nFive days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the River Jordan in Palestine.<ref>''Magnificent Monarchs'' (Fact Attack series) p.21 by [[Ian Locke]]; published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1999; {{ISBN|978-0330-374965}}</ref> The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' described the young king in 1889 as \"the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth\".<ref>\"The Happiest Living Monarch\", ''New York Times.'' 14 August 1889.</ref> His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] to the United States as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\nWhen he came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1902/03/29/archives/alfonsos-reign-begins-may-17-he-will-take-the-oath-on-that-day.html?sq=Alfonso+XIII&scp=101&st=p \"Alfonso's Reign Begins on 17 May; He Will Take the Oath on That Day \u2013 Festivities to Last a Week,\"] ''New York Times,'' 29 March 1902.</ref> He took his oath to the constitution before members of the Cortes on 17 May.\n\n===Engagement and marriage===\n[[File:The Nine Sovereigns at Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII.jpg|thumb|right|The nine sovereigns at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], photographed on 20 May 1910.

Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]]]]\nBy 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he stayed at [[Buckingham Palace]] with King [[Edward VII]]. There he met Princess [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.\n\nVictoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in March.\n\n[[File:Anarchist attack on the King of Spain Alfonso XIII (1906).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day]]\nIn May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the [[San Jer\u00f3nimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Jer\u00f3nimo]] in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). The wedding was marked by [[Morral affair|an assassination attempt]] on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan [[anarchist]] Mateu Morral. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured many bystanders and members of the procession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edwardianpromenade.com/weddings/royal-wedding-1-victoria-eugenie-alfonso-xiii/|title=Royal Wedding #1: Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg & King Alfonso XIII of Spain|work=Edwardian Promenade|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907\u20131938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], was born. However, Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.\n\nNeither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, [[Gonzalo of Spain|Gonzalo]] (1914\u20131934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his wife for transmitting the condition to their sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/339/1018871276.html|title=Reinas Borbones de cuidado|work=elmundo.es|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children.

Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed.

Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the \"Disaster of the Annual\" while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say \"Chicken meat is cheap\", before resuming his game of golf.<ref>Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 284.</ref> Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the \"Disaster of the Annual\", which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King couldn't care less about the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the ''Cortes'' started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre's advance into the Rif mountains.\n\nAfter the \"Disaster of the Annual\", Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the ''abandonistas'' grew as many people could see no point to the war.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in [[Malaga]] simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the [[Republic of the Rif|Rif Republic]] was waved about.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> With the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the ''abandonistas'' forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the [[Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera#Military_establishes_dictatorship|military coup d'\u00e9tat later in 1923]].<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> On September 13, 1923, General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera]], seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning ''Cortes'' report into the Annual disaster. The poetic [[Generation of '27]] as well as Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era.\n\n=== Downfall and Second Republic ===\nIn January 1930, due to economic problems and general unpopularity, Miguel Primo de Rivera resigned as Prime Minister. Alfonso, as the Prime Minister's ally, shared the popular dislike. The King had so closely associated with the [[Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost seven years. In April 1931, [[General]] [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]] told him even the army was not loyal. On 12 April, the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections. The municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy. Alfonso left the country on 14 April as the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed, but did not formally abdicate.

There he met Princess [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.\n\nVictoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in March.\n\n[[File:Anarchist attack on the King of Spain Alfonso XIII (1906).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day]]\nIn May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage.

This honour was intended, in part, to commemorate the diplomatic and trading history which existed long before other Western nations were officially aware of Japan's existence. [[Prince Takamatsu]] travelled with his wife, [[Princess Takamatsu]], to Spain. Her symbolic role in this unique mission to the Spanish Court was intended to emphasize the international links which were forged by her 16th-century ancestor, [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]]. In the years before the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], that innovative ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' from Western Japan had been actively involved in negotiating trade and diplomatic treaties with Spain and with the colonies of New Spain (Mexico) and the Philippines; and it was anticipated that the mere presence of the Princess could serve to underscore the range of possibilities which could be inferred from that little-known history.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1930/11/03/archives/japan-to-decorate-kind-alfonso-today-emperors-brother-nears-madrid.html?sq=order+of+the+chrysanthemum+&scp=4&st=p \"Japan to Decorate King Alfonso Today; Emperor's Brother Nears Madrid With Collar of the Chrysanthemum for Spanish King,\"] ''New York Times,'' 3 November 1930; ''see also'' Nutail, Zelia.
