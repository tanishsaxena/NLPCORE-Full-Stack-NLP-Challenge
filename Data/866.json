Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Eljigidei]], and a proposal of a joint attack upon the Islamic powers of [[Syria]]. In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]]; with Longjumeau went his brother Jacques (also a Dominican) and several others \u2013 John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert \"Le [[Sommelier]]\", Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}}\n\nThe party set out on 16 February 1249, with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents including a chapel-tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], and certainly through [[Taraz|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}}\n\nOn arrival at the supreme Mongol court \u2013 either that on the [[Emil River|Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Alakol]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] \u2013 Andrew found G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Oghul Qaimish]] (the \"Camus\" of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for Louis IX. But it is certain that before the friar had left \"Tartary\", [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], G\u00fcy\u00fck's successor, had been elected.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|pp=972\u2013973}}\n\nAndrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] with [[Prester John]]; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the [[Mongols]]' homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]]. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Christianity among the Mongols|Mongol Christianity]] and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host) are based on fact.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}}\n\nMounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of \"Tartary\" (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead [[Genghis Khan|Khan]], gifts which were treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], \"''se repenti fort''\" (\"felt very sorry\").{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "further information", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Franco-Mongol alliance"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Europeans in Medieval China"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Beazley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "972"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Beazley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "972"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Beazley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "972\u2013973"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Beazley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "973"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Beazley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "973"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Death", "paragraphs": "The date and location of Andrew's death is unknown.<ref name=\"Dorcy1990\">{{cite book|last=Dorcy|first=Sr. Mary Jean|title=St. Dominic's Family: Over 300 Famous Dominicans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL-cCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=24 November 1990|publisher=TAN Books|isbn=9781505103465|page=62}}</ref>\n\nWe only know of Andrew through references in other writers: see especially [[William of Rubruck]]'s in ''Recueil de voyages'', iv.
