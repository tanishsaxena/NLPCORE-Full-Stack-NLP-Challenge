Other services include [[Apple Store]], [[Genius Bar]], [[AppleCare]], [[Apple Pay]], [[Apple Pay Cash]], and [[Apple Card]].\n\nApple was founded by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], and [[Ronald Wayne]] in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm, but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1,000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e's mantra of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].<ref name=insidestoryCarlton>{{Cite book |last= Carlton |first= Jim |year= 1997 |title= Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders |location= New York |publisher= [[Random House]] |isbn= 978-0-8129-2851-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/appleinsidestory00carl}}</ref>{{Rp|79\u201380}} Selling Macintosh at such high profit margins was only possible because of its dominant position in the desktop publishing market.<ref>{{Cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Swaine|2014}}|first=Michael |last=Swaine |year=2014 |title=Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer |publisher=Pragmatic Bookshelf |isbn=9781680503524}} pp. 359\u2013363</ref>\n\nThis policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 is the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.<ref name=insidestoryCarlton />{{Rp|117\u2013129}} During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gass\u00e9e deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gass\u00e9e in January 1990 by appointing [[Michael Spindler]] as the [[chief operating officer]].{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=184\u2013185}} Gass\u00e9e left the company later that year.{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=160}} In October 1990, Apple introduced three lower-cost models, the [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC]], and [[Macintosh IIsi]],{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=128}} all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.\n\nIn 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the \"luggable\" [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops.

The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new [[Siri Remote]] with a glass [[touchpad]], [[gyroscope]], and [[microphone]].\n\nOn December 12, 2016, Apple released a new iOS and tvOS [[media player (software)|media player]] app called [[Apple TV (software)|TV]] to replace the existing \"Videos\" iOS application.\n\nAt the September 12, 2017 event, Apple released a new [[4K resolution|4K]] Apple TV with the same form factor as the 4th Generation model.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Thomas |last=Ricker |title=First Click: Apple's greatest innovation is its ecosystem |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 7, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in June 2017 that Apple's increased reliance on [[Siri]], its [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual personal assistant]], has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality. Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Tripp |last=Mickle |title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'\u2014How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, two articles from ''The Verge'' and ''[[ZDNet]]'' debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apple's macOS and iOS software platforms.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Tripp |last=Mickle |title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'\u2014How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, two articles from ''The Verge'' and ''[[ZDNet]]'' debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apple's macOS and iOS software platforms.

Ireland|Leprechaun economics}}\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]],\" which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Duhigg |first1=Charles |last2=Kocieniewski |first2=David |title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2012 |date=April 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,<ref>{{Cite news |last= Watson |first= Roland |title= Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax' |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date= October 30, 2012}}</ref> which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues.

It was not until 2018 that Irish economists could definitively prove that the 2015 growth was due to Apple restructuring its controversial [[double Irish]] subsidiaries (Apple Sales International), which Apple converted into a new Irish [[corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes|capital allowances for intangible assets]] tax scheme (expires in January 2020). The affair required the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] to create a new measure of Irish economic growth, [[modified gross national income|Modified GNI*]] to replace Irish GDP, given the distortion of Apple's tax schemes. Irish GDP is 143% of Irish Modified GNI*.\n\nOn August 30, 2016, after [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|a two-year investigation]], the EU Competition Commissioner concluded Apple received \"illegal State aid\" from Ireland.
