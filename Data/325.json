''Tree of Life \u2013 Asteraceae'']</ref> Which of the two families actually is the larger is unclear, because of the uncertainty about how many [[Extant taxon|extant]] species each family includes. \n\nNearly all Asteraceae bear their flowers in dense heads (capitula or pseudanthia) surrounded by [[bract#Involucral bracts|involucral bracts]]. When viewed from a distance, each [[Capitulum (flower)|capitulum]] may have the appearance of being a single flower. Enlarged outer (peripheral) flowers in the capitula may resemble petals, and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx. The name Asteraceae comes from the type genus ''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1}}, meaning star, and refers to the star-like form of the  inflorescence.

The family has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], with species ranging from [[Wiktionary:subpolar|subpolar]] to tropical regions, colonizing a wide variety of habitats. The largest proportion of the species occur in the [[arid]] and semiarid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes.<ref name=\"Barkley et al.\">{{eFloras|1|10074|Asteraceae |first1=Theodore M. |last1=Barkley |first2=Luc |last2=Brouillet |first3=John L. |last3=Strother |volume=19, 20 and 21}}</ref> The Asteraceae may represent as much as 10% of [[Autochthon (nature)|autochthonous]] flora in many regions of the world.\n\nAsteraceae is an economically important family, providing products such as [[cooking oil]]s, [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[lettuce]], [[sunflower seed]]s, [[artichoke]]s, [[sweetening agent]]s, coffee substitutes and [[herbal tea]]s. Several genera are of [[horticulture|horticultural]] importance, including pot marigold (''[[Calendula officinalis]]''), ''[[Echinacea]]'' (coneflowers), various daisies, [[Erigeron|fleabane]], [[chrysanthemum]]s, [[dahlia]]s, [[zinnia]]s, and [[helenium]]s.

Of these, many are [[invasive species]] in particular regions, often having been introduced by human agency. Examples include various [[tumbleweed]]s, ''[[Bidens]]'', [[Ambrosia (plant)| ragweeds]], [[thistle]]s, and [[Taraxacum officinale|dandelion]].

They are generally easy to distinguish from other plants, mainly because of their characteristic [[inflorescence]] and other shared characteristics.<ref name=\"Judd\" /> However, determining genera and species of some groups such as ''[[Hieracium#Species|Hieracium]]'' is notoriously difficult (see \"[[damned yellow composite]]\" for example).\n\n=== Roots and stems ===\nMembers of the Asteraceae generally produce [[taproot]]s, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Stems are herbaceous aerial branched cylindrical with glandular hairs generally erect but can be prostrate to ascending. Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.<ref name=\"Barkley et al.\" />\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] and the stems very often contain secretory canals with [[resin]] or [[latex]] (particularly common among the Cichorioideae). The leaves can be [[phyllotaxis|alternate]], [[phyllotaxis|opposite]], or [[phyllotaxis|whorled]]. They may be simple, but are often deeply [[leaf#Morphology|lobed]] or otherwise [[leaf#Morphology|incised]], often [[leaf#Morphology|conduplicate]] or [[leaf#Morphology|revolute]].

29\u201332</ref> The overall appearance of the cluster, as a single flower, functions in attracting [[pollinators]] in the same way as the structure of an individual flower in some other plant families.<ref name=CDF /> The older family name, Compositae, comes from the fact that what appears to be a single flower is actually a ''composite'' of smaller flowers.<ref name=CDF /> The \"petals\" or \"sunrays\" in a sunflower head are actually individual strap-shaped<ref name=MDW>Pam MacKay, Mojave Desert Wildflowers, illustration p. 35</ref> flowers called '''ray flowers''', and the \"sun disk\" is made of smaller circular shaped individual flowers called '''disc flowers'''.<ref name=CDF /> The word \"aster\" means \"star\" in Greek, referring to the appearance of some family members, as a \"star\" surrounded by \"rays\".<ref name=CDF /> The cluster of flowers that may appear to be a single flower, is called a ''head''.<ref name=CDF /> The entire head may move tracking the sun, like a \"smart\" solar panel, which maximizes reflectivity of the whole unit and can thereby attract more pollinators.<ref name=CDF />\nAt the base of the head, and surrounding the flowers before opening, is a bundle of [[sepal]]-like [[bract]]s or scales called [[phyllaries]], which together form the ''involucre'' that protects the individual flowers in the head before opening.<ref name=CDF /> The individual heads have the smaller individual flowers arranged on a round or dome-like structure called the ''receptacle''.<ref name=CDF /> The flowers mature first at the outside, moving toward the center, with the youngest in the middle.<ref name=CDF />\n\nThe individual flowers in a head have 5 fused petals (rarely 4), but instead of sepals, have threadlike, hairy, or bristly structures called ''[[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]'', which surround the fruit and can stick to animal fur or be lifted by wind, aiding in seed dispersal.<ref name=CDF /> The whitish fluffy head of a dandelion, commonly blown on by children, is made of the pappus, with tiny seeds attached at the ends, whereby the pappus provides a parachute like structure to help the seed be carried away in the wind.<ref name=CDF />\n\n[[File:Ray-floret.svg|thumb|upright=.77|Ligulate floret: A&nbsp;=&nbsp;ovary, B&nbsp;=&nbsp;pappus, C&nbsp;=&nbsp;anthers, D&nbsp;=&nbsp;ligule, E&nbsp;=&nbsp;style with

(3-lobed), strap-shaped, individual flower in the head of some members of the family Asteraceae.<ref name=CDF /><ref name=MDW /> Sometimes a ray flower is 2-tipped (2-lobed).<ref name=CDF /> The [[petal|corolla]] of the ray flower may have 2 tiny teeth opposite the 3-lobed strap, or tongue, indicating evolution by fusion from an originally 5-part corolla.<ref name=CDF /> Sometimes, the 3:2 arrangement is reversed, with 2 tips on the tongue, and 0 or 3 tiny teeth opposite the tongue.<ref name=CDF /> A ''ligulate flower'' is a 5-tipped, strap-shaped, individual flower in the heads of other members.<ref name=CDF /> A ''ligule'' is the strap-shaped tongue of the [[petal|corolla]] of either a ray flower or of a ligulate flower.<ref name=MDW />  A ''disk flower'' (or ''disc flower'') is a radially symmetric (i.e., with identical shaped petals arranged in circle around the center) individual flower in the head, which is ringed by ray flowers when both are present.<ref name=CDF /><ref name=MDW /> Sometimes ray flowers may be slightly off from radial symmetry, or weakly bilaterally symmetric, as in the case of desert pincushions ''[[Chaenactis fremontii]]''.<ref name=CDF />\n\nA ''radiate head'' has disc flowers surrounded by ray flowers.<ref name=CDF /> A ''ligulate head'' has all ligulate flowers.<ref name=CDF /> When a sunflower family flower head has only disc flowers that are sterile, male, or have both male and female parts, it is a ''discoid head''.<ref name=CDF /> ''Disciform heads'' have only disc flowers, but may have two kinds (male flowers and female flowers) in one head, or may have different heads of two kinds (all male, or all female).<ref name=CDF /> ''Pistillate heads'' have all female flowers.

The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].\n\nA set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called \"phyllaries\", or \"involucral bracts\". They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).\n\nEach floret may be subtended by a bract, called a \"palea\" or \"receptacular bract\". These bracts are often called \"[[chaff]]\". The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.\n\nThe florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &mdash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &mdash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).\n\nThe [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.\n\nThere are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''n\u00fcdelspritze'').\n\nThe [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].\n\n=== Fruits and seeds ===\nIn members of the Asteraceae the fruit is [[achene]]-like, and is called a ''cypsela'' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]], which is derived from [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in [[dandelion]]). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in ''[[Helianthus]]''). Cypsela [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is often used to help determine plant relationships at the genus and species level.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | pages = 569\u2013594 | url = <!-- http://apt.allenpress.com/aptonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=0026-6493&volume=092&issue=04&page=0569 -->http://cel.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=CEL&SID=S1JkbNkVD3FqTrQJUhx&UT=000234320700004&SrcApp=Highwire&action=retrieve&Init=Yes&Func=Frame&SrcAuth=Highwire&customersID=Highwire&IsProductCode=Yes&mode=FullRecord | title = Morphology Of Cypselae In Subtribe Arctotidinae (Compositae\u2013Arctotideae) And Its Taxonomic Implications | author = McKenzie, R.J. | author2 = Samuel, J. | author3 = Muller, E.M. | author4 = Skinner, A.K.W. | author5 = Barker, N.P. | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | year = 2005 | jstor = 40035740 | access-date = 21 April 2014 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20140421054746/http://cel.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=CEL&SID=S1JkbNkVD3FqTrQJUhx&UT=000234320700004&SrcApp=Highwire&action=retrieve&Init=Yes&Func=Frame&SrcAuth=Highwire&customersID=Highwire&IsProductCode=Yes&mode=FullRecord | archive-date = 21 April 2014 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The mature [[seed]]s usually have little [[endosperm]] or none.<ref name=\"Judd\" />\n=== Pollen ===\nThe pollen of composites is typically echinolophate, a [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] term meaning \"with elaborate systems of ridges and spines dispersed around and between the apertures.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tomb |first1=A.

The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].\n\nA set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called \"phyllaries\", or \"involucral bracts\". They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).\n\nEach floret may be subtended by a bract, called a \"palea\" or \"receptacular bract\". These bracts are often called \"[[chaff]]\". The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.\n\nThe florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &mdash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &mdash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).\n\nThe [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.\n\nThere are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''n\u00fcdelspritze'').\n\nThe [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Henk"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Beentje"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Kew Plant Glossary, an illustrated dictionary of plant terms"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Kew Publishing"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Richmond, U.K."}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781842464229"}]}, {"name": "LCCN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "666025447"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": " Fruits and seeds ", "paragraphs": "In members of the Asteraceae the fruit is [[achene]]-like, and is called a ''cypsela'' (plural ''cypselae'').
