Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting.<ref name=\"Xu S\"/> Other adverse complications included five reported cases of [[spinal cord injuries]] (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five [[heart]] injuries, seven other organ and tissue
