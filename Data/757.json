Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the [[United States Army]] and served in both houses of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the \"common man\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=473}} against a \"corrupt aristocracy\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=219}} and to preserve the Union.\n\nBorn in the colonial [[Waxhaws|Carolinas]] to a [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] family in the decade before the [[American Revolutionary War]], Jackson became a [[American frontier|frontier]] lawyer and married [[Rachel Donelson Robards]]. He served briefly in the [[U.S. House of Representatives|United States House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate|United States Senate]], representing [[Tennessee]]. After resigning, he served as a [[List of Justices of the Tennessee Supreme Court|justice]] on the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], and became a wealthy, slaveowning planter. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the [[Tennessee State Guard|Tennessee militia]] and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the [[Creek War]] of 1813\u20131814, winning the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. The subsequent [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] required the [[Muscogee|Creek]] surrender of vast lands in present-day [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In the concurrent [[War of 1812|war against the British]], Jackson's victory in 1815 at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] made him a national hero. Jackson then led U.S. forces in the [[First Seminole War]], which led to the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|annexation]] of [[Florida]] from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected [[John Quincy Adams]] in a [[contingent election]]. In reaction to the alleged \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" between Adams and [[Henry Clay]] and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].\n\nJackson ran again in [[1828 United States presidential election|1828]], defeating Adams in a landslide. Jackson faced the threat of secession by [[South Carolina]] over what opponents called the \"[[Tariff of Abominations]].\" The [[Nullification Crisis|crisis]] was defused when the tariff was [[Tariff of 1833|amended]], and Jackson [[Force Bill|threatened]] the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy [[Bank War|struggle]], Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party \"[[spoils system]]\" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which forcibly [[Trail of Tears|relocated]] most members of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the South to [[Indian Territory]]. The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and disease. Jackson opposed the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement, which grew stronger in his second term. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a \"most favored nation\" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and recognized the [[Republic of Texas]]. In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president.\n\nIn his retirement, Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies of [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]]. Though fearful of its effects on the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate, Jackson advocated the [[annexation of Texas]], which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson has been widely revered in the United States as an advocate for democracy and the common man. Many of his actions proved divisive, garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country. His reputation has suffered since the 1970s, largely due to his role in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] removal. Surveys of historians and scholars have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] Jackson favorably among U.S. presidents.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "7th president of the United States"}]}, {"name": "Infobox officeholder\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Andrew Jackson"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Andrew jackson headFXD.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "White-haired man with black coat"}, {"name": "office", "value": "7th [[President of the United States]]"}, {"name": "vicepresident", "value": "{{unbulleted list|[[John C.

Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane, and continued to serve as governor until 1809.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=119\u2013124}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Durham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "218\u2013219"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Semmer"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Blythe"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=698"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Jackson Purchase, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Tennessee Historical Society"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "April 12, 2017"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160807120650/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=698"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "August 7, 2016"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "18\u201319"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "p", "value": "19"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "92\u201394"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "110\u2013112"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=j000005"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Andrew Jackson"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "April 13, 2017"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131218110615/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000005"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "December 18, 2013"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "113"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "114"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "131"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "21\u201322"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "15\u201316; 119"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "119"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "119\u2013124"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Planting career and controversy", "paragraphs": "[[File:AndrewJackson-RewardNotice-EscapedSlave-1804.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Notice of reward offered by Jackson for return of an enslaved man{{sfn|Cumfer|2007|p=140}}]]\nIn addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as [[Planter (American South)|planter]], [[slavery in the United States|slave owner]], and merchant.

Slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in {{convert|400|sqft|m2}} cabins made either of brick or logs. The size and quality of the Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times. To help slaves acquire food, Jackson supplied them with guns, knives, and fishing equipment.

Jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough.<ref name=Hermitage_Slavery_2011/> At various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation.

By May 1806, [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]], who, like Jackson, raced horses, had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a [[duel]]. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. He became a social outcast.{{sfn|Brands|2005|pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nAfter the Sevier affair and the duel, Jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation.

In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators.

Jackson stands atop the parapet with his right hand outstretched and holding a sword.]]\n\nAfter arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814,{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=247}} Jackson instituted [[martial law]] in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with [[Jean Lafitte]]'s smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees,{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201330}} in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=254}} These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] and later General [[Edward Pakenham]], consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201330}} Jackson had only about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=274}}\n[[File:Andrew Jackson (1845).jpg|thumb|left|Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans, painted by [[Thomas Sully]] in 1845 from an earlier portrait he had completed from life in 1824 |alt=Gray-haired man in blue army coat and black overcoat has his left glove on and right glove on the ground. He is writing on papers and stands beside a cannon.]]\n\nThe British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the morning of December 23. That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back.{{sfn|Snelling|1831|pp=73\u201376}} On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster.{{sfn|Snelling|1831|pp=81\u201385}} For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=285}} After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the [[Treaty of Ghent]] had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the \"Second American Revolution\" against the British.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201333}} By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the [[Thanks of Congress]] and awarded a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref name=\"US Congress Bio\"/>\n\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (\"underwhelmed\" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' that Jackson \"was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.\"{{sfn|Leeden|2001|pp=32\u201333}} Some have claimed that, because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the Treaty of Ghent, Jackson's victory at New Orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure. However, the Spanish, who had sold the Louisiana Territory to France, disputed France's right to sell it to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=72\u201373}} In April 1815, Spain, assuming that the British had won at New Orleans, asked for the return of the Louisiana Territory. Spanish representatives claimed to have been assured that they would receive the land back.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=299}} Furthermore, Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent stipulated that the United States must return land taken from the Creeks to their original owners, essentially undoing the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Thanks to Jackson's victory at New Orleans, the American government felt that it could safely ignore that provision and it kept the lands that Jackson had acquired.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n====Enforced martial law in New Orleans====\nJackson, still not knowing for certain of the treaty's signing, refused to lift martial law in the city. State senator Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the field of battle. Jackson attempted to find the author and, after Louiallier admitted to having written the piece, he was imprisoned.{{sfn|Warshauer|2006|p=32}} In March 1815, after U.S. District Court Judge [[Dominic Augustin Hall|Dominic A. Hall]] signed a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' on behalf of Louaillier, Jackson ordered [[Arrest of Dominic Hall and Louis Louaillier|Hall's arrest]].{{sfn|Martin|1829|pp=387\u2013495}} Jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, and a lawyer, and after the intervention of State Judge [[Joshua Lewis (judge)|Joshua Lewis]]. Lewis was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and also had signed a writ of ''habeas corpus'' against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Eaton| first = Fernin F| title = For Whom the Drone Tolls or What if Andrew Jackson had Drones at the Battle of New Orleans, A Bit of Bicentennial Mischief| url = https://www.academia.edu/3701970| publisher = Academia| accessdate = March 13, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170717173213/http://www.academia.edu/3701970/For_Whom_the_Drone_Tolls_or_What_if_Andrew_Jackson_Had_Drones_at_the_Battle_of_New_Orleans--A_bit_of_Bicentennial_Mischief| archivedate = July 17, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCivilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson\u2014he summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave.

Ambrister was one of two British subjects executed by General Jackson. (1848) |alt=Two soldiers stand trial. Several other men gather around.]]\n\nSeveral Native American tribes, which became known as the [[Seminole]], straddled the border between the U.S. and Florida. The Seminole, in alliance with escaped slaves, frequently raided Georgia settlements before retreating back into Florida. These skirmishes continually escalated, and the conflict is now known as the [[First Seminole War]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=36\u201337}} In 1816, Jackson led a detachment into Florida which [[Battle of Negro Fort|destroyed]] the [[Fort Gadsden|Negro Fort]], a community of escaped slaves and their descendants.{{sfn|Brands|2005|pp=325\u2013327}} Jackson was ordered by President Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the Seminole and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves, after Spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His orders from President Monroe were to \"terminate the conflict.\"{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=118}} Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to Monroe, \"Let it be signified to me through any channel&nbsp;... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ogg|1919|p=66}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson bust.jpg|thumb|Teracotta bust of General Jackson by [[William Rush]], 1819 |alt=Bust of Jackson in military uniform. Hair is wavy and falls partway down the forehead.]]\n\nJackson invaded Florida on March 15, 1818, capturing Pensacola. He crushed Seminole and Spanish resistance in the region and captured two British agents, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been working with the Seminole. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of them, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, since the United States had not [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] upon Spain. He was defended by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]]. Adams thought that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell Florida to the United States in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated Jackson, but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House [[Henry Clay]]. After the ratification of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1821, Jackson resigned from the army and briefly served as the territorial [[Governor of Florida]] before returning to Tennessee.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=37\u201340}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Creek War"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "165\u2013169"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/1812-01.asp"}, {"name": "title", "value": "An Act Declaring War Between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Dependencies Thereof and the United States of America and Their Territories"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 18, 1812"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Yale Law School: Lillian Goldman Law Library"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "July 11, 2017"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161206004103/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/1812-01.asp"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "December 6, 2016"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "169"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "170"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "173"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.17400200/?sp=1"}, {"name": "title", "value": "General orders ....

During the massacre, hundreds of white American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The Red Sticks, led by chiefs [[William Weatherford|Red Eagle]] and [[Peter McQueen]], had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They were allied with [[Tecumseh]], a [[Shawnee]] chief who had launched [[Tecumseh's War]] against the United States, and who was fighting alongside the British.

On October 10, he set out on the expedition, his arm still in a sling from fighting the Bentons. Jackson established [[Fort Strother]] as a supply base. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the [[Battle of Tallushatchee]].{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=192\u2013193}} Coming to the relief of friendly Creeks besieged by Red Sticks, Jackson won another decisive victory at the [[Battle of Talladega]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=25\u201328}} In the winter, Jackson, encamped at Fort Strother, faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions. He sent Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops. From January 22\u201324, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the [[Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek]]. Jackson's troops repelled the attackers, but outnumbered, were forced to withdraw to Fort Strother.{{sfn|Adams|1986|pp=791\u2013793}} Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the [[Tallapoosa River]]. On March 27, enjoying an advantage of more than 2&nbsp;to 1, he engaged them at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. A subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=213\u2013216}}\n\nThe campaign ended three weeks later with Red Eagle's surrender, although some Red Sticks such as McQueen fled to [[East Florida]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=27\u201328}} On June 8, Jackson accepted a commission as [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army]], and 10 days later became a [[major general (United States)|major general]], in command of the Seventh Military Division.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=222}} Subsequently, Jackson, with Madison's approval, imposed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. The treaty required the Muscogee, including those who had not joined the Red Sticks, to surrender 23 million acres (8,093,713 ha) of land to the United States.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=27\u201328}} Most of the Creeks bitterly acquiesced.{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=236}} Though in ill-health from [[dysentery]], Jackson turned his attention to defeating Spanish and British forces.

The Spanish surrendered and the British fled. Weeks later, he learned that the British were planning an attack on [[New Orleans]], which sat on the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and held immense strategic and commercial value. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish, placed a force in [[Mobile, Alabama]] to guard against a possible invasion there, and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=241\u2013245}}\n\nThe Creeks coined their own name for Jackson, ''Jacksa Chula Harjo'' or \"Jackson, old and fierce.\"{{sfn|Jahoda|1975|p=6}}\n\n====Battle of New Orleans====\n{{main|Battle of New Orleans}}\n[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|The ''Battle of New Orleans''.

Jackson stands atop the parapet with his right hand outstretched and holding a sword.]]\n\nAfter arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814,{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=247}} Jackson instituted [[martial law]] in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with [[Jean Lafitte]]'s smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees,{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201330}} in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=254}} These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] and later General [[Edward Pakenham]], consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201330}} Jackson had only about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=274}}\n[[File:Andrew Jackson (1845).jpg|thumb|left|Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans, painted by [[Thomas Sully]] in 1845 from an earlier portrait he had completed from life in 1824 |alt=Gray-haired man in blue army coat and black overcoat has his left glove on and right glove on the ground.

That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back.{{sfn|Snelling|1831|pp=73\u201376}} On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster.{{sfn|Snelling|1831|pp=81\u201385}} For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=285}} After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the [[Treaty of Ghent]] had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the \"Second American Revolution\" against the British.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201333}} By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the [[Thanks of Congress]] and awarded a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref name=\"US Congress Bio\"/>\n\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (\"underwhelmed\" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' that Jackson \"was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.\"{{sfn|Leeden|2001|pp=32\u201333}} Some have claimed that, because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the Treaty of Ghent, Jackson's victory at New Orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure. However, the Spanish, who had sold the Louisiana Territory to France, disputed France's right to sell it to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=72\u201373}} In April 1815, Spain, assuming that the British had won at New Orleans, asked for the return of the Louisiana Territory. Spanish representatives claimed to have been assured that they would receive the land back.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=299}} Furthermore, Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent stipulated that the United States must return land taken from the Creeks to their original owners, essentially undoing the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Thanks to Jackson's victory at New Orleans, the American government felt that it could safely ignore that provision and it kept the lands that Jackson had acquired.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n====Enforced martial law in New Orleans====\nJackson, still not knowing for certain of the treaty's signing, refused to lift martial law in the city. State senator Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the field of battle. Jackson attempted to find the author and, after Louiallier admitted to having written the piece, he was imprisoned.{{sfn|Warshauer|2006|p=32}} In March 1815, after U.S. District Court Judge [[Dominic Augustin Hall|Dominic A.

Lewis was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and also had signed a writ of ''habeas corpus'' against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Eaton| first = Fernin F| title = For Whom the Drone Tolls or What if Andrew Jackson had Drones at the Battle of New Orleans, A Bit of Bicentennial Mischief| url = https://www.academia.edu/3701970| publisher = Academia| accessdate = March 13, 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170717173213/http://www.academia.edu/3701970/For_Whom_the_Drone_Tolls_or_What_if_Andrew_Jackson_Had_Drones_at_the_Battle_of_New_Orleans--A_bit_of_Bicentennial_Mischief| archivedate = July 17, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCivilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson\u2014he summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave.

During the massacre, hundreds of white American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The Red Sticks, led by chiefs [[William Weatherford|Red Eagle]] and [[Peter McQueen]], had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They were allied with [[Tecumseh]], a [[Shawnee]] chief who had launched [[Tecumseh's War]] against the United States, and who was fighting alongside the British. The resulting conflict became known as the [[Creek War]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n[[File:General Andrew Jackson from Harpers Vol 28 1864.png|thumb|General Andrew Jackson as pictured in Harper's Magazine, Vol 28, ''War with the Creek Indians'', page 605, 1864 |alt=Man in blue military uniform, white pants, and boots, holding sword]]\nJackson, with 2,500 men, was ordered to crush the hostile Indians. On October 10, he set out on the expedition, his arm still in a sling from fighting the Bentons. Jackson established [[Fort Strother]] as a supply base. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the [[Battle of Tallushatchee]].{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=192\u2013193}} Coming to the relief of friendly Creeks besieged by Red Sticks, Jackson won another decisive victory at the [[Battle of Talladega]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=25\u201328}} In the winter, Jackson, encamped at Fort Strother, faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions. He sent Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops. From January 22\u201324, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the [[Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek]]. Jackson's troops repelled the attackers, but outnumbered, were forced to withdraw to Fort Strother.{{sfn|Adams|1986|pp=791\u2013793}} Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the [[Tallapoosa River]]. On March 27, enjoying an advantage of more than 2&nbsp;to 1, he engaged them at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. A subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=213\u2013216}}\n\nThe campaign ended three weeks later with Red Eagle's surrender, although some Red Sticks such as McQueen fled to [[East Florida]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=27\u201328}} On June 8, Jackson accepted a commission as [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army]], and 10 days later became a [[major general (United States)|major general]], in command of the Seventh Military Division.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=222}} Subsequently, Jackson, with Madison's approval, imposed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. The treaty required the Muscogee, including those who had not joined the Red Sticks, to surrender 23 million acres (8,093,713 ha) of land to the United States.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=27\u201328}} Most of the Creeks bitterly acquiesced.{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=236}} Though in ill-health from [[dysentery]], Jackson turned his attention to defeating Spanish and British forces. Jackson accused the Spanish of arming the Red Sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing British soldiers into the Floridas.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=240}} The first charge was true,{{sfn|Adams|1986|pp=228\u2013229}} while the second ignored the fact that it was Jackson's threats to invade Florida which had caused them to seek British protection.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=241}} In the November 7 [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|Battle of Pensacola]], Jackson defeated British and Spanish forces in a short skirmish. The Spanish surrendered and the British fled. Weeks later, he learned that the British were planning an attack on [[New Orleans]], which sat on the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and held immense strategic and commercial value. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish, placed a force in [[Mobile, Alabama]] to guard against a possible invasion there, and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=241\u2013245}}\n\nThe Creeks coined their own name for Jackson, ''Jacksa Chula Harjo'' or \"Jackson, old and fierce.\"{{sfn|Jahoda|1975|p=6}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Creek War"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "165\u2013169"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/1812-01.asp"}, {"name": "title", "value": "An Act Declaring War Between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Dependencies Thereof and the United States of America and Their Territories"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 18, 1812"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Yale Law School: Lillian Goldman Law Library"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "July 11, 2017"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161206004103/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/1812-01.asp"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "December 6, 2016"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "169"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "170"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "173"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.17400200/?sp=1"}, {"name": "title", "value": "General orders ....

An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets.

Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the \"Second American Revolution\" against the British.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201333}} By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the [[Thanks of Congress]] and awarded a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref name=\"US Congress Bio\"/>\n\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (\"underwhelmed\" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' that Jackson \"was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.\"{{sfn|Leeden|2001|pp=32\u201333}} Some have claimed that, because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the Treaty of Ghent, Jackson's victory at New Orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure.

Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His orders from President Monroe were to \"terminate the conflict.\"{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=118}} Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to Monroe, \"Let it be signified to me through any channel&nbsp;... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ogg|1919|p=66}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson bust.jpg|thumb|Teracotta bust of General Jackson by [[William Rush]], 1819 |alt=Bust of Jackson in military uniform.

He crushed Seminole and Spanish resistance in the region and captured two British agents, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been working with the Seminole. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of them, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, since the United States had not [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] upon Spain. He was defended by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]]. Adams thought that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell Florida to the United States in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated Jackson, but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House [[Henry Clay]]. After the ratification of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1821, Jackson resigned from the army and briefly served as the territorial [[Governor of Florida]] before returning to Tennessee.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=37\u201340}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "First Seminole War"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "p", "value": "36"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "332\u2013340"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "36\u201337"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Brands"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "325\u2013327"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "118"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ogg"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1919"}, {"name": "p", "value": "66"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "37\u201340"}]}], "id": 12}, {"title": "Presidential aspirations", "paragraphs": "===Election of 1824===\n{{Main|1824 United States presidential election}}\n\nIn the spring of 1822, Jackson suffered a physical breakdown.

Jackson feared that he was on the brink of death. After several months of rest, he recovered.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=1\u20133}} During his convalescence, Jackson's thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs. He obsessed over rampant corruption in the Monroe administration and grew to detest the [[Second Bank of the United States]], blaming it for causing the [[Panic of 1819]] by contracting credit.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=12\u201315}}\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson in 1824, painted by [[Thomas Sully]]|alt=A man with wavy gray hair in white shirt, black bowtie, and black coat.

Crawford]], who had been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford. Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks. The Panic of 1819 had devastated the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular. With his growing political viability, Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates, along with Crawford, Adams, Clay, and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]]. During the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the Federalist Party had faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions. On the major issues of the day, most prominently the [[Tariff of 1824|tariff]], Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions. At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption. Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=41\u201345}}\n\nIn 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats. The move was independently orchestrated by his advisors [[William Berkeley Lewis]] and U.S. Senator [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]] in order to defeat incumbent [[John Williams (Tennessee)|John Williams]], who openly opposed his presidential candidacy. The legislature narrowly elected him.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=50\u201354}}{{sfn|Brands|2005|pp=376\u2013377}} His return, after 24 years, 11 months, 3&nbsp;days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/12/04/bob-smith-and-the-12-year-itch/ |title=Bob Smith and the 12-Year Itch |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=December 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129093027/https://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/12/04/bob-smith-and-the-12-year-itch/ |archivedate=January 29, 2016 }}</ref> Although Jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the Senate, he was appointed chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]].{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=67}} Eaton wrote to Rachel that Jackson as a senator was \"in harmony and good understanding with every body,\" including Thomas Hart Benton, now a senator from Missouri, with whom Jackson had fought in 1813.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=38}} Meanwhile, Jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency, as was customary.

In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Crawford for president and [[Albert Gallatin]] for vice president. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for president a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the \"voice of the people\" in the \"vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate.\"{{sfn|Rutland|1995|pp=48\u201349}} Gallatin criticized Jackson as \"an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office.\"{{sfn|Adams|1879|p=599}} After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nIn the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]], taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency. He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidate, but still short of 131, which he needed for a true majority. With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]] under the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention. Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency. Clay, who as Speaker of the House presided over the election, saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership. He threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally funded [[internal improvement]]s such as roads and canals. With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot. Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" after Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=45\u201348}} \"So you see,\" Jackson growled, \"the Judas of the West has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver. [H]is end will be the same.\"{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=98}} After the election, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|p=49}}\n\n===Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson===\n{{Main|1828 United States presidential election|Andrew Jackson 1828 presidential campaign}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1828.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|alt=Refer to caption|1828 election results]]\n\nAlmost immediately, opposition arose to the Adams presidency.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=102}} Jackson opposed Adams's plan to involve the U.S. in [[Panama]]'s quest for independence, writing, \"The moment we engage in confederations, or alliances with any nation, we may from that time date the down fall of our republic.\" Adams damaged his standing in his first annual message to Congress, when he argued that Congress must not give the world the impression \"that we are palsied by the will of our constituents.\"{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=108\u2013110}}\n\nJackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election. It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency foundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. New York Senator [[Martin Van Buren]], who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in 1824, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Adams's followers became known as the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=49\u201354}} In the large Scots-Irish community that was especially numerous in the rural South and Southwest, Jackson was a favorite.{{sfn|Byrne|Coleman|King|2008|p=837}}\n\nThe campaign was heavily personal. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press.

His body had two bullets lodged in it, and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning. He regularly coughed up blood, and his entire body shook. Jackson feared that he was on the brink of death. After several months of rest, he recovered.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=1\u20133}} During his convalescence, Jackson's thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs. He obsessed over rampant corruption in the Monroe administration and grew to detest the [[Second Bank of the United States]], blaming it for causing the [[Panic of 1819]] by contracting credit.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=12\u201315}}\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson in 1824, painted by [[Thomas Sully]]|alt=A man with wavy gray hair in white shirt, black bowtie, and black coat.

Crawford]], who had been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford. Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks. The Panic of 1819 had devastated the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular. With his growing political viability, Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates, along with Crawford, Adams, Clay, and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]]. During the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the Federalist Party had faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions. On the major issues of the day, most prominently the [[Tariff of 1824|tariff]], Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions. At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption. Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=41\u201345}}\n\nIn 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats. The move was independently orchestrated by his advisors [[William Berkeley Lewis]] and U.S. Senator [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]] in order to defeat incumbent [[John Williams (Tennessee)|John Williams]], who openly opposed his presidential candidacy. The legislature narrowly elected him.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=50\u201354}}{{sfn|Brands|2005|pp=376\u2013377}} His return, after 24 years, 11 months, 3&nbsp;days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/12/04/bob-smith-and-the-12-year-itch/ |title=Bob Smith and the 12-Year Itch |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=December 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129093027/https://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/12/04/bob-smith-and-the-12-year-itch/ |archivedate=January 29, 2016 }}</ref> Although Jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the Senate, he was appointed chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]].{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=67}} Eaton wrote to Rachel that Jackson as a senator was \"in harmony and good understanding with every body,\" including Thomas Hart Benton, now a senator from Missouri, with whom Jackson had fought in 1813.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=38}} Meanwhile, Jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency, as was customary.

In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Crawford for president and [[Albert Gallatin]] for vice president. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for president a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the \"voice of the people\" in the \"vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate.\"{{sfn|Rutland|1995|pp=48\u201349}} Gallatin criticized Jackson as \"an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office.\"{{sfn|Adams|1879|p=599}} After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nIn the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]], taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency. He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidate, but still short of 131, which he needed for a true majority. With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]] under the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention. Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency. Clay, who as Speaker of the House presided over the election, saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership. He threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally funded [[internal improvement]]s such as roads and canals. With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot. Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" after Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=45\u201348}} \"So you see,\" Jackson growled, \"the Judas of the West has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver.

It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency foundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. New York Senator [[Martin Van Buren]], who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in 1824, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Adams's followers became known as the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=49\u201354}} In the large Scots-Irish community that was especially numerous in the rural South and Southwest, Jackson was a favorite.{{sfn|Byrne|Coleman|King|2008|p=837}}\n\nThe campaign was heavily personal. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press.

Jackson took a moral tone, with the belief that agrarian sympathies, and a limited view of states rights and the federal government, would produce less corruption.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=104}} He feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values.

He then set about choosing his cabinet members.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=157\u2013158}} Jackson chose Van Buren as expected for Secretary of State, Eaton of Tennessee as Secretary of War, [[Samuel D. Ingham]] of Pennsylvania as Secretary of Treasury, [[John Branch]] of North Carolina as Secretary of Navy, [[John M. Berrien]] of Georgia as Attorney General, and [[William T.

Jackson's first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=105}} Jackson blamed Adams in part for what was said about Rachel during the campaign, and refused to meet him after arriving in Washington. Therefore, Adams chose not to attend the inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nOn March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pinotable.html|title=Inaugurals of Presidents of the United States: Some Precedents and Notable Events|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 18, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701120453/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pinotable.html|archivedate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> In his inaugural speech, Jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency. He also promised to pursue \"reform\" by removing power from \"unfaithful or incompetent hands.\" At the conclusion of the ceremony, Jackson invited the public to the [[White House]], where his supporters held a raucous party. Thousands of spectators overwhelmed the White House staff, and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings. Jackson's populism earned him the nickname \"King Mob.\"{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n===Reforms, rotation of offices, and spoils system===\n{{Further|Spoils system}}\n\nIn an effort to purge the government of corruption, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments. He believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|pp=65\u201366}} He believed that the federal government had been corrupted and that he had received a mandate from the American people to purge such corruption. Jackson's investigations uncovered enormous fraud in the federal government, and numerous officials were removed from office and indicted on corruption. In the first year of Jackson's presidency, his investigations uncovered $280,000 stolen from the Treasury, and the Department of the Navy was saved $1 million.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=186\u2013187}} He asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster General Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, as well as failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances. Jackson replaced Barry with Treasury Auditor and prominent Kitchen Cabinet member [[Amos Kendall]], who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Post Office Department.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=67}}\n\n{{CSS image crop|Image = JACKSON, Andrew-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 250|oTop = 75|oLeft = 45|Location = left|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] engraved portrait of Jackson as president |alt=Man with wavy white hair and black clothing looks to his left}}\nJackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as president.<ref name=firstaddress>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's First Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471 |accessdate=March 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080226130931/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471| archivedate= February 26, 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's Second Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29472 |accessdate=March 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080311113901/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29472| archivedate= March 11, 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view \"I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress.\"<ref name=\"3rd Message\"/>\n\nAlthough he was unable to implement these goals, Jackson's time in office did see a variety of other reforms. He supported an act in July 1836 that enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband's pensions.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=193\u2013194}} In 1836, Jackson established the ten-hour day in national shipyards.{{sfn|Nevins|Commanger|Morris|1992|p=168}}\n\nJackson enforced the [[Tenure of Office Act (1820)|Tenure of Office Act]], signed by President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed that a [[Term limits in the United States|rotation in office]] was a democratic reform preventing hereditary officeholding and made civil service responsible to the popular will.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=61}} Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was \"a leading principle in the republican creed.\"<ref name=\"firstaddress\"/> Jackson noted, \"In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=418}} Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson rotated only about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|pp=61\u201362}} Jackson, nonetheless, used his presidential power to award loyal Democrats by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmaster, Jackson stated, \"[i]f he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me.\"{{sfn|Sabato|O'Connor|2002|p=293}}\n\nJackson's theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the [[spoils system]].{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=61}} The political realities of Washington sometimes forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=328\u2013334}} Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades) proved to be difficult.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=65}} Remini writes that because \"friendship, politics, and geography constituted the President's total criteria for appointments, most of his appointments were predictably substandard.\"{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=268}}\n\n===Petticoat affair===\n{{Main|Petticoat affair}}\nJackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the \"Petticoat affair\" or \"Eaton affair.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=107}} Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's cabinet members and their wives, including Calhoun's wife [[Floride Calhoun]], concerning Secretary of War Eaton and his wife [[Margaret O'Neill Eaton|Peggy Eaton]]. Salacious rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=115}} Controversy also ensued because Peggy had married soon after her previous husband's death, and it was alleged that she and her husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living.{{sfn|Marszalek|2000|p=84}} Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. Allowing a prostitute in the official family was unthinkable\u2014but Jackson refused to believe the rumors, telling his Cabinet that \"She is as chaste as a virgin!\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=115}} Jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers, who in essence questioned and dishonored Jackson himself by, in attempting to drive the Eatons out, daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet. Jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife. These memories increased his dedication to defending Peggy Eaton.{{sfn|Bates|2015|p=315}}\n\nMeanwhile, the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all American women was at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nIn the spring of 1831, Jackson, at Van Buren's suggestion, demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except Barry. Van Buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would \"...{{nbsp}}kill [Van Buren], sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}} Van Buren continued to serve as an important adviser to Jackson and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the 1832 election, making him Jackson's heir-apparent.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> The Petticoat affair led to the development of the [[Kitchen Cabinet]]. The Kitchen Cabinet emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president. Its existence was partially rooted in Jackson's difficulties with his official cabinet, even after the purging.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|pp=171\u2013175}}\n\n===Indian removal policy===\n{{Further|Indian removal|Indian Removal Act|Trail of Tears}}\n[[File:Trails of Tears en.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Jackson's Indian Removal Act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] from their traditional territories, including the [[Trail of Tears]].|alt=Map of the southern United States showing in dark green areas ceded by Indians]]\n\nThroughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with Native American tribes both in the [[Old Southwest|South]] and in the [[Old Northwest|Northwest]].{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=109}} Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-[[European American|Anglo]] American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}} Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates. The southern tribes included the [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee|Creek]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Seminole]] and the [[Cherokee]]. The northwest tribes include the [[Chippewa]], [[Odawa|Ottawa]], and the [[Potawatomi]].{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=110}}\n\nRelations between Indians and Americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}} Previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to \"civilize\" the Indians,{{sfn|Rutland|1995|pp=199\u2013200}} but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention. There had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue, and out of this policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}}\n\nIn his First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the [[Mississippi River]] be set aside for Indian tribes. On May 26, 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which Jackson signed into law two days later. The Act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west, outside of existing state borders.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=109}} The act specifically pertained to the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] in the [[Southern United States|South]], the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law, effectively relinquishing their sovereignty.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=269}}\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson, by Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl, c. 1788 - 1838.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Jackson by [[Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl|Earl]], 1830 |alt=White-haired man stands outdoors beside a tree with cane.]]\nJackson, Eaton, and General Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=271}} Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw. Lacking Jackson's skills at negotiation, they frequently bribed the chiefs in order to gain their submission. The tactics worked, and the chiefs [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek|agreed]] to move. The removal of the Choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832, and was wrought with misery and suffering.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=272\u2013273}} The Seminole, despite the signing of the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]] in 1832,{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=304}} refused to move.

Briggs]]. Remini argues that Jackson did not say it because, while it \"certainly sounds like Jackson...[t]here was nothing for him to enforce.\" This is because a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' had never been issued for the missionaries.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=276\u2013277}} The Court also did not ask [[federal marshal]]s to carry out the decision, as had become standard.{{sfn|Berutti|1992|pp=305\u2013306}}\n\nA group of Cherokees led by [[John Ridge]] negotiated the [[Treaty of New Echota]].

Southern planters, who sold their cotton on the world market, strongly opposed this tariff, which they saw as favoring northern interests. The South now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally; and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton. The issue came to a head during Jackson's presidency, resulting in the [[Nullification Crisis]], in which South Carolina threatened disunion.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nThe [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, asserted that their state had the right to \"nullify\"\u2014declare void\u2014the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. One incident came at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to \"The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.\" Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added \"Our federal Union: It must be preserved!\"&nbsp;\u2013 a clear challenge to Calhoun.

Calhoun's and Jackson's relationship deteriorated further. By February 1831, the break between Calhoun and Jackson was final. Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud, Calhoun had published letters between him and Jackson detailing the conflict in the ''United States Telegraph''.

It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates. Written by Treasury Secretary [[Louis McLane]], the bill lowered duties from 45% to 27%. In May, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill, which Jackson accepted. It passed Congress on July 9 and was signed by the president on July 14.

It was introduced by Senator [[Felix Grundy]] of Tennessee, and was quickly attacked by Calhoun as \"military despotism.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|pp=239\u2013240}} At the same time, Calhoun and Clay began to work on a new [[Tariff of 1833|compromise tariff]]. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative [[Gulian C. Verplanck]] of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=38}} The Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=247}} The Force Bill passed the same day.

The French king [[Louis Philippe I]] and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies. By 1834, the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In [[:s:Andrew Jackson's Sixth State of the Union Address|his December 1834 State of the Union address]], Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was \"wholly disappointed\" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=119}} Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until Jackson had apologized for his remarks.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=284}} In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, reparations were paid.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nIn addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with [[Denmark]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], and [[Siam]]. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies. The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nJackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Mexico, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested that the U.S. take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] began when pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent [[Republic of Texas]]. The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. Jackson was hesitant in recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren was elected president. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating [[Alc\u00e9e Louis la Branche]] as charg\u00e9 d'affaires on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nJackson failed in his efforts to open trade with China and Japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\n===Bank veto and election of 1832===\n{{Main|Bank War|Banking in the Jacksonian Era|United States presidential election, 1832}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1832.svg|thumb|1832 election results|alt=A map of the 1832 presidential election.

The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Van Buren. The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Henry Clay, now a senator from [[Kentucky]], and [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]] of Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=218}} The [[Anti-Masonic Party]] emerged by capitalizing on opposition to [[Freemasonry]], which existed primarily in New England, after the disappearance and possible murder of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]].{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=420}} The party, which had earlier held its convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] of Maryland and [[Amos Ellmaker]] of Pennsylvania. Clay was, like Jackson, a Mason, and so some anti-Jacksonians who would have supported the National Republican Party supported Wirt instead.{{sfn|Latner|2002|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nIn 1816, the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was chartered by President [[James Madison]] to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=111}} Monroe had appointed [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] as the Bank's executive.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} Jackson believed that the Bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly. Its stock was mostly held by foreigners, he insisted, and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system. Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy. Jackson stated the Bank made \"the rich richer and the potent more powerful.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} He accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=53}} In his address to Congress in 1830, Jackson called for a substitute for the Bank that would have no private stockholders and no ability to lend or purchase land. Its only power would be to issue bills of exchange.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=302}} The address touched off fiery debate in the Senate. Thomas Hart Benton, now a strong supporter of the president despite the brawl years earlier, gave a speech excoriating the Bank and calling for debate on its recharter. Webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution. Shortly afterward, the ''Globe'' announced that Jackson would stand for reelection.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nDespite his misgivings about the Bank, Jackson supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary [[Louis McLane]], who was secretly working with Biddle, to recharter a reformed version of the Bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nation's debt. This would be done, in part, through the sale of government stock in the Bank. Over the objections of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Roger B. Taney]], an irreconcilable opponent of the Bank, he allowed McLane to publish a Treasury Report which essentially recommended rechartering the Bank.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=337\u2013340}}\n\nClay hoped to make the Bank an issue in the election, so as to accuse Jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed a recharter bill. He and Webster urged Biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=201}} Biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate Democrats such as McLane and William Lewis, who argued that Biddle should wait because Jackson would likely veto the recharter bill. On January 6, 1832, Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter without any of the proposed reforms.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=343}} The submission came four years before the original 20-year charter was to end. Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} Jackson determined to veto it. Many moderate Democrats, including McLane, were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his decision. When Van Buren met Jackson on July 4, Jackson declared, \"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it.\"{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=363\u2013366}} Jackson vetoed the bill on July 10. The veto message was crafted primarily by Taney, Kendall, and Jackson's nephew and advisor [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. It attacked the Bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=366\u2013369}} The veto was considered \"one of the strongest and most controversial\" presidential statements{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=369}} and \"a brilliant political manifesto.\"{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=369\u2013370}} The [[National Republican Party]] immediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue.{{sfn|Latner|2002|pp=112\u2013113}} Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as \"the very slang of the leveller and demagogue,\" claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}}\n\nAt Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=376}} Jackson successfully portrayed his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match for Jackson's ability to resonate with the people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=113}} Jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. He won the election by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party eventually declined.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=220}} Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=63}}\n\n===Removal of deposits and censure===\nIn 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.{{sfn|Bogart|1907|pp=219\u2013221}} Jackson's moves were greatly controversial. He removed McLane from the Treasury Department, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing [[Edward Livingston]]. He replaced McLane with [[William J. Duane]].{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=57\u201358; 171}} In September, he fired Duane for refusing to remove the deposits. Signalling his intent to continue battling the Bank, he replaced Duane with Taney.{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|p=395}} Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed.{{sfn|Bogart|1907|pp=219\u2013221}} They were placed in a variety of state banks which were friendly to the administration's policies, known to critics as [[pet banks]].{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=500}} Biddle responded by stockpiling the Bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic. The moves were intended to force Jackson into a compromise. \"Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress,\" he wrote. At first, Biddle's strategy was successful, putting enormous pressure on Jackson.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1953|p=103}} But Jackson handled the situation well. When people came to him complaining, he referred them to Biddle, saying that he was the man who had \"all the money.\"{{sfn|Parton|1860b|pp=549\u2013550}} Jackson's approach worked.

During a stopover near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Randolph appeared and struck the president. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the writer [[Washington Irving]]. Jackson declined to press charges.{{sfn|Paletta|Worth|1988}}\n\nOn January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the United States occurred just outside the [[United States Capitol]]. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]], [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]], an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired.

He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the president dead, \"money would be more plenty,\" (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he \"could not rise until the President fell.\" Finally, Lawrence told his interrogators that he was a deposed English king\u2014specifically, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], dead since 1485\u2014and that Jackson was his clerk.{{sfn|Bates|2015|p=513}} He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=229}}\n\nAfterwards, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same [[Divine providence|Providence]] that also protected their young nation. The incident became a part of Jacksonian mythos. Jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life. His suspicions were never proven.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=229\u2013230}}\n\n===Anti-slavery tracts===\nDuring the summer of 1835, Northern [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] began sending anti-slavery tracts through the postal system into the South.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=117}} Pro-slavery Southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials, which were deemed \"incendiary,\" and some began to riot. Jackson wanted sectional peace, and desired to placate Southerners ahead of the 1836 election.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=258\u2013263}} He fiercely disliked the abolitionists, whom he believed were, by instituting sectional jealousies, attempting to destroy the Union.{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=554}} Jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection. He supported the solution of Postmaster General Amos Kendall, which gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=258\u2013263}} That December, Jackson called on Congress to prohibit the circulation through the South of \"incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.\"{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=261}}\n\n===U.S. Exploring Expedition===\n[[File:USS Porpoise (1836).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}}, a [[brig]] ship laid down in 1835 and launched in May 1836; used in the U.S. Exploring Expedition |alt=Sketch of a ship with sails at sea]]\n\nJackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office.{{sfn|Mills 2003|page=705}} The last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823, led by [[Stephen Harriman Long|Stephen H. Harriman]] on the [[Red River of the North]]. Jackson's predecessor, President Adams, attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adams' expedition plans. Eventually, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to Jefferson and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], Jackson sponsored scientific exploration during his second term. On May 18, 1836, Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic [[United States Exploring Expedition]]. Jackson put Secretary of the Navy [[Mahlon Dickerson]] in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired. Dickerson proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, during the presidency of Van Buren.{{sfn|Mills 2003|p=705}} One [[brig]] ship, {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}}, later used in the expedition; having been commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the [[Southern Ocean]], confirming the existence of the [[Antarctica]] continent.<ref name=USSPO>{{cite web|title=USS Porpoise (1836\u20131854) |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-p/porpois2.htm |publisher=U.S. Navy |date=2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002123011/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-p/porpois2.htm }}</ref>\n\n===Panic of 1837===\n{{Main|Panic of 1837}}\n[[File:The times panic 1837.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A New York newspaper blamed the Panic of 1837 on Andrew Jackson, depicted in spectacles and top hat.|alt=Political cartoon showing people suffering from economic trouble]]\nIn spite of economic success following Jackson's vetoes and war against the Bank, reckless speculation in land and railroads eventually caused the [[Panic of 1837]].{{sfn|Olson|2002|p=190}} Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their lending standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.{{sfn|Olson|2002|p=190}} The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841, when the economy began to rebound.<ref name=\"npr\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm |title=Historical Debt Outstanding \u2013 Annual 1791\u20131849 |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |work=Public Debt Reports |publisher=Treasury Direct |archivedate=October 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030060937/https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm }}</ref>\n\n===Administration and cabinet===\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=left\n|Name=Jackson<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.potus.com/ajackson.html |title=Andrew Jackson |last=Summers |first=Robert S. |website=POTUS: Presidents of the United States |access-date=May 31, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606030310/http://potus.com/ajackson.html |archivedate=June 6, 2017 }}</ref>\n|President=Andrew Jackson\n|President start=1829\n|President end=1837\n|Vice President=[[John C.

had approved the \"[[Tariff of Abominations]]\", which set the tariff at an historically high rate. Southern planters, who sold their cotton on the world market, strongly opposed this tariff, which they saw as favoring northern interests. The South now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally; and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton. The issue came to a head during Jackson's presidency, resulting in the [[Nullification Crisis]], in which South Carolina threatened disunion.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nThe [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, asserted that their state had the right to \"nullify\"\u2014declare void\u2014the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. One incident came at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to \"The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.\" Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added \"Our federal Union: It must be preserved!\"&nbsp;\u2013 a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding \"The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!\"{{sfn|Ogg|1919|p=164}}\n\nIn May 1830, Jackson discovered that Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure Jackson for his invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818 while Calhoun was serving as Secretary of War. Calhoun's and Jackson's relationship deteriorated further. By February 1831, the break between Calhoun and Jackson was final. Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud, Calhoun had published letters between him and Jackson detailing the conflict in the ''United States Telegraph''.

After it sided with Calhoun on nullification, Jackson needed a new organ for the administration.

A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative [[Gulian C. Verplanck]] of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=38}} The Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=247}} The Force Bill passed the same day.

The French king [[Louis Philippe I]] and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies. By 1834, the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In [[:s:Andrew Jackson's Sixth State of the Union Address|his December 1834 State of the Union address]], Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was \"wholly disappointed\" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=119}} Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until Jackson had apologized for his remarks.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=284}} In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, reparations were paid.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nIn addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with [[Denmark]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], and [[Siam]]. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies. The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nJackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Mexico, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested that the U.S. take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] began when pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent [[Republic of Texas]]. The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. Jackson was hesitant in recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren was elected president. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating [[Alc\u00e9e Louis la Branche]] as charg\u00e9 d'affaires on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nJackson failed in his efforts to open trade with China and Japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "119\u2013120"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Cunningham"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Hugo S."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Gold and Silver Standards France"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/gold-std.html#france"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "August 28, 2014"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140818064041/http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/gold-std.html#france"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "August 18, 2014"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "119"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1984"}, {"name": "p", "value": "284"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "120"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "120"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "120"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "120"}]}], "id": 23}, {"title": "Bank veto and election of 1832", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Bank War|Banking in the Jacksonian Era|United States presidential election, 1832}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1832.svg|thumb|1832 election results|alt=A map of the 1832 presidential election.

The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Van Buren. The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Henry Clay, now a senator from [[Kentucky]], and [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]] of Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=218}} The [[Anti-Masonic Party]] emerged by capitalizing on opposition to [[Freemasonry]], which existed primarily in New England, after the disappearance and possible murder of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]].{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=420}} The party, which had earlier held its convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] of Maryland and [[Amos Ellmaker]] of Pennsylvania. Clay was, like Jackson, a Mason, and so some anti-Jacksonians who would have supported the National Republican Party supported Wirt instead.{{sfn|Latner|2002|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nIn 1816, the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was chartered by President [[James Madison]] to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=111}} Monroe had appointed [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] as the Bank's executive.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} Jackson believed that the Bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly. Its stock was mostly held by foreigners, he insisted, and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system. Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy. Jackson stated the Bank made \"the rich richer and the potent more powerful.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} He accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=53}} In his address to Congress in 1830, Jackson called for a substitute for the Bank that would have no private stockholders and no ability to lend or purchase land. Its only power would be to issue bills of exchange.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=302}} The address touched off fiery debate in the Senate. Thomas Hart Benton, now a strong supporter of the president despite the brawl years earlier, gave a speech excoriating the Bank and calling for debate on its recharter. Webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution. Shortly afterward, the ''Globe'' announced that Jackson would stand for reelection.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nDespite his misgivings about the Bank, Jackson supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary [[Louis McLane]], who was secretly working with Biddle, to recharter a reformed version of the Bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nation's debt. This would be done, in part, through the sale of government stock in the Bank. Over the objections of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Roger B. Taney]], an irreconcilable opponent of the Bank, he allowed McLane to publish a Treasury Report which essentially recommended rechartering the Bank.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=337\u2013340}}\n\nClay hoped to make the Bank an issue in the election, so as to accuse Jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed a recharter bill. He and Webster urged Biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=201}} Biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate Democrats such as McLane and William Lewis, who argued that Biddle should wait because Jackson would likely veto the recharter bill. On January 6, 1832, Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter without any of the proposed reforms.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=343}} The submission came four years before the original 20-year charter was to end. Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} Jackson determined to veto it. Many moderate Democrats, including McLane, were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his decision. When Van Buren met Jackson on July 4, Jackson declared, \"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it.\"{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=363\u2013366}} Jackson vetoed the bill on July 10. The veto message was crafted primarily by Taney, Kendall, and Jackson's nephew and advisor [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. It attacked the Bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=366\u2013369}} The veto was considered \"one of the strongest and most controversial\" presidential statements{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=369}} and \"a brilliant political manifesto.\"{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=369\u2013370}} The [[National Republican Party]] immediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue.{{sfn|Latner|2002|pp=112\u2013113}} Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as \"the very slang of the leveller and demagogue,\" claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}}\n\nAt Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=376}} Jackson successfully portrayed his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match for Jackson's ability to resonate with the people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=113}} Jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. He won the election by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party eventually declined.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=220}} Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=63}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bank War"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Banking in the Jacksonian Era"}, {"name": "3", "value": "United States presidential election, 1832"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Meacham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "218"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Meacham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "420"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "112\u2013113"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "111"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "112"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "112"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Meacham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "53"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "p", "value": "302"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "303\u2013304"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "337\u2013340"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Meacham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "201"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "p", "value": "343"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "112"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "363\u2013366"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "366\u2013369"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "p", "value": "369"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilentz"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "369\u2013370"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "112\u2013113"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "112"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Remini"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "p", "value": "376"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Latner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "p", "value": "113"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Meacham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "220"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ellis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1974"}, {"name": "p", "value": "63"}]}], "id": 24}, {"title": "Removal of deposits and censure", "paragraphs": "In 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.{{sfn|Bogart|1907|pp=219\u2013221}} Jackson's moves were greatly controversial.

He had ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the navy for [[embezzlement]]. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS ''Cygnet'' to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of [[Mary Ball Washington]], [[George Washington]]'s mother.

Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States.

He immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=121}} He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, \"I will die with the Union.\"{{sfn|Curtis|1976|p=145}} Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson continued to denounce the \"perfidy and treachery\" of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to repudiate the Specie Circular as president.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=121}}\n\nAs a solution to the panic, he supported an [[Independent Treasury]] system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of [[Hard money (policy)|gold or silver]] and would be restricted from printing [[Banknote|paper money]] so as to prevent further [[inflation]].{{sfn|Lansford|Woods|2008|p=1046}} A coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero [[William Henry Harrison]] and former Jacksonian [[John Tyler]] in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]]. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats when Jackson ran. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a man of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=462\u2013470}} He favored the nomination of Polk for vice president at the [[1840 Democratic National Convention]] over controversial incumbent [[Richard Mentor Johnson]]. No nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=463\u2013464}}\n\nHarrison won the election, and the Whigs captured majorities in both houses of Congress. \"The democracy of the United States has been shamefully beaten,\" Jackson wrote to Van Buren. \"but I trust, not conquered.\"{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=470}} Harrison died only a month into his term, and was replaced by Tyler. Jackson was encouraged because Tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=472\u2013473}} Sure enough, Tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the Whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two Whig-sponsored bills to establish a new national bank, bringing satisfaction to Jackson and other Democrats.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=475\u2013476}} After the second veto, Tyler's entire cabinet, with the exception of [[Daniel Webster]], resigned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/1841-09-18/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1841&index=0&rows=20&words=Cabinet+John+Tyler&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1841&proxtext=john+tyler+cabinet&y=12&x=16&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 |title=New-York tribune., September 18, 1841 |publisher=The Library of Congress |access-date=June 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJackson strongly favored the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]], a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency. While Jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti-slavery sentiment, his belief that the British would use Texas as a base to threaten the United States overrode his other concerns.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=161\u2013163}} He also insisted that Texas was part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and therefore rightfully belonged to the United States.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=492}} At the request of Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] of Mississippi, acting on behalf of the Tyler administration, which also supported annexation, Jackson wrote several letters to Texas president [[Sam Houston]], urging him to wait for the Senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the United States would benefit Texas.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=493}} Initially prior to the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]], Jackson again supported Van Buren for president and Polk for vice president. A treaty of annexation was signed by Tyler on April 12, 1844, and submitted to the Senate. When a letter from Secretary of State Calhoun to British Ambassador [[Richard Pakenham]] linking annexation to slavery was made public, anti-annexation sentiment exploded in the North and the bill failed to be ratified. Van Buren decided to write the \"Hamlet letter,\" opposing annexation. This effectively extinguished any support that Van Buren might previously have enjoyed in the South.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=496\u2013500}} The Whig nominee, Henry Clay, also opposed annexation, and Jackson recognized the need for the Democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the South. If the plan failed, Jackson warned, Texas would not join the Union and would potentially fall victim to a Mexican invasion supported by the British.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/maj.01111_0326_0333/?sp=1&st=text |title=Andrew Jackson to Francis Preston Blair, May 7, 1844 |publisher=Jackson Papers, LOC |access-date=December 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216091554/https://www.loc.gov/resource/maj.01111_0326_0333/?sp=1&st=text |archivedate=December 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nJackson met with Polk, [[Robert Armstrong (1792\u20131854)|Robert Armstrong]], and Andrew Jackson Donelson in his study.

Polk called the scheme \"utterly abortive,\" but agreed to go along with it.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=501}} At the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], Polk emerged as the party's nominee after Van Buren failed to win the required two-thirds majority of delegates. [[George M. Dallas]] was selected for vice president. Jackson convinced Tyler to drop his plans of running for re-election as an independent by promising, as Tyler requested, to welcome the President and his allies back into the Democratic Party and by instructing Blair to stop criticizing the President.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=502\u2013505}} Polk won the election, defeating Clay.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=161\u2013163}} A bill of annexation was passed by Congress in February and signed by Tyler on March 1.{{snf|Remini|1984|pp=510\u2013511}}\n\nJackson's age and illness eventually overcame him. On June 8, 1845, he was surrounded by family and friends at his deathbed. Jackson, startled by their sobbing, said, \"What is the matter with my dear children? Have I alarmed you? Oh, do not cry.

Historian [[Charles Grier Sellers]] says, \"Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage.\" There has never been universal agreement on Jackson's legacy, for \"his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies, and his friends almost his worshippers.\"{{sfn|Sellers|1958|p=615}} He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies.

Trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|Andrew Jackson, I am given to understand, was a patriot and a traitor. He was one of the greatest generals, and wholly ignorant of the art of war. A brilliant writer, elegant, eloquent, without being able to compose a correct sentence or spell words of four syllables. The first of statesmen, he never devised, he never framed, a measure. He was the most candid of men, and was capable of the most profound dissimulation. A most law-defying law-obeying citizen. A stickler for discipline, he never hesitated to disobey his superior. A democratic autocrat. An urbane savage. An atrocious saint.{{sfn|Parton|1860a|p=vii}}}}\n\nJackson was criticized by his contemporary [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' for flattering the dominant ideas of his time, including the mistrust over the federal power, for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law:\n\n{{quote|Far from wishing to extend the Federal power, the President belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the Union; far from standing forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is the agent of the state jealousies; and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government. It is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity. General Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its propensities, and its demands\u2014say, rather, anticipates and forestalls them. ...\n\nGeneral Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority; but when he feels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy. Supported by a power that his predecessors never had, he tramples on his personal enemies, whenever they cross his path, with a facility without example; he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt. He even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult; he puts his veto on the laws of Congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly.|author=[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]|source=[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/1_ch18.htm Democracy in America, 1835, Volume I, Chapter XVIII]}}\n\nIn the 20th century, Jackson was written about by many admirers.

He also claims that the Indian controversy has eclipsed Jackson's other achievements in public memory.

Over time, while the Revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience, memory of the War of 1812, including the Battle of New Orleans, has sharply declined.

Historian [[Charles Grier Sellers]] says, \"Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage.\" There has never been universal agreement on Jackson's legacy, for \"his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies, and his friends almost his worshippers.\"{{sfn|Sellers|1958|p=615}} He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies. He has been lauded as the champion of the common man, while criticized for his treatment of Indians and for other matters.{{sfn|Sellers|1958|pp=615\u2013634}} [[James Parton]] was the first man after Jackson's death to write a full biography of him. Trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|Andrew Jackson, I am given to understand, was a patriot and a traitor. He was one of the greatest generals, and wholly ignorant of the art of war. A brilliant writer, elegant, eloquent, without being able to compose a correct sentence or spell words of four syllables. The first of statesmen, he never devised, he never framed, a measure. He was the most candid of men, and was capable of the most profound dissimulation. A most law-defying law-obeying citizen. A stickler for discipline, he never hesitated to disobey his superior. A democratic autocrat. An urbane savage. An atrocious saint.{{sfn|Parton|1860a|p=vii}}}}\n\nJackson was criticized by his contemporary [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' for flattering the dominant ideas of his time, including the mistrust over the federal power, for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law:\n\n{{quote|Far from wishing to extend the Federal power, the President belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the Union; far from standing forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is the agent of the state jealousies; and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government. It is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity. General Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its propensities, and its demands\u2014say, rather, anticipates and forestalls them. ...\n\nGeneral Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority; but when he feels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy. Supported by a power that his predecessors never had, he tramples on his personal enemies, whenever they cross his path, with a facility without example; he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt. He even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult; he puts his veto on the laws of Congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly.|author=[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]|source=[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/1_ch18.htm Democracy in America, 1835, Volume I, Chapter XVIII]}}\n\nIn the 20th century, Jackson was written about by many admirers. [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]]'s ''Age of Jackson'' (1945) depicts Jackson as a man of the people battling inequality and upper-class tyranny.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|p=3}} From the 1970s to the 1980s, Robert Remini published a three-volume biography of Jackson followed by an abridged one-volume study.

This new man was no longer British. He no longer wore the queue and silk pants.

Starting mainly around 1970, Jackson came under attack from some historians on this issue. [[Howard Zinn]] called him \"the most aggressive enemy of the Indians in early American history\" and \"exterminator of Indians.\"{{sfn|Zinn|1980|p=127}}{{sfn|Zinn|1980|p=130}} Conversely, in 1969, [[Francis Paul Prucha]] argued that Jackson's removal of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" from the extremely hostile white environment in the Old South to Oklahoma probably saved their very existence.{{sfn|Prucha|1969|pp=527\u2013539}} Similarly, Remini claims that, if not for Jackson's policies, the Southern tribes would have been totally wiped out, just like other tribes-namely, the [[Yamasee]], [[Mahican]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]]\u2013which did not move.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=574}} Jackson has long been honored, along with Thomas Jefferson, in the [[Jefferson\u2013Jackson Day]] fundraising dinners held by state Democratic Party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders. Because both Jefferson and Jackson were slave owners, as well as because of Jackson's Indian removal policies, many state party organizations have renamed the dinners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/blogs/under_the_dome/ph-ac-cn-political-calendar-20160208-story.html |title=Democrats Bounce Jefferson and Jackson from Annual Dinner |last=Hutzell |first=Rick |date=February 8, 2016 |publisher=The Anne Arundel Capital-Gazette |access-date=May 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114032156/http://www.capitalgazette.com/blogs/under_the_dome/ph-ac-cn-political-calendar-20160208-story.html |archivedate=January 14, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/jefferson-jackson-dinner-will-be-renamed.html |title=Jefferson-Jackson Dinner Will Be Renamed |last=Southall |first=Ashley |date=August 5, 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172703/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/jefferson-jackson-dinner-will-be-renamed.html |archivedate=April 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nBrands argues that Jackson's reputation suffered since the 1960s as his actions towards Indians and African Americans received new attention. He also claims that the Indian controversy has eclipsed Jackson's other achievements in public memory. Brands notes that he was often hailed during his lifetime as the \"second George Washington,\" because, while Washington had fought for independence, Jackson confirmed it at New Orleans and made the United States a [[great power]]. Over time, while the Revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience, memory of the War of 1812, including the Battle of New Orleans, has sharply declined.
