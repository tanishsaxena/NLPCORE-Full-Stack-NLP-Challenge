A close ally of [[Adolf Hitler]], he was convicted at the [[Nuremberg trials]] and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nAn architect by training, Speer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in Nuremberg. In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for Berlin. In this capacity he was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement that [[Nazi persecution of Jews|evicted Jewish tenants]] from their homes in Berlin. In February 1942, Speer was appointed as [[Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production]]. Using doctored statistics, he promoted himself as having performed an \"armaments miracle\" that was widely credited with keeping Germany in the war. In 1944, Speer established a [[J\u00e4gerstab|task force]] to increase production of fighter aircraft. It became instrumental in the exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] for the benefit of the German war effort.\n\nAfter the war, Speer was among the 24 \"major war criminals\" arrested and charged with the crimes of the Nazi regime at the Nuremberg trials. He was found guilty of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], principally for the use of [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|slave labor]], narrowly avoiding a death sentence. Having served his full term, Speer was released in 1966. He used his writings from the time of imprisonment as the basis for two autobiographical books, ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]''. Speer's books were a success; the public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich. Speer died of a [[stroke]] in 1981. Little remains of his personal architectural work.\n\nThrough his autobiographies and interviews, Speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich. He continued to deny explicit knowledge of, and responsibility for, [[the Holocaust]]. This image dominated his historiography in the decades following the war, giving rise to the \"Speer Myth\". The first theme of the myth posits that after his appointment as Minister of Armaments he revolutionized the German war machine. The second theme is that he was an apolitical technocrat. Beginning in the 1980s, the myth began to fall apart. The armaments miracle was attributed to [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]]. [[Adam Tooze]] wrote in ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'' that the idea that Speer was an apolitical technocrat was \"absurd\". [[Martin Kitchen]], writing in ''[[Speer: Hitler's Architect]]'', stated that much of the increase in Germany's arms production was actually down to systems instituted by Speer's predecessor ([[Fritz Todt]]) and furthermore Speer was intimately involved in the \"[[Final Solution]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Minister of Armaments and War Production in Nazi Germany"}]}, {"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the Nazi minister"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "March 2012"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox officeholder\n", "values": [{"name": "birthname", "value": "Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Bundesarchiv Bild 146II-277, Albert Speer.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "Monochrome photograph of the upper body of Albert Speer, signed at the bottom"}, {"name": "office1", "value": "[[Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production]]"}, {"name": "term_start1", "value": "February 8, 1942"}, {"name": "term_end1", "value": "April 30, 1945"}, {"name": "1blankname1", "value": "Head of state"}, {"name": "1namedata1", "value": "[[Adolf Hitler]] (as [[F\u00fchrer]])"}, {"name": "2blankname1", "value": "Head of government"}, {"name": "2namedata1", "value": "Adolf Hitler"}, {"name": "office2", "value": "Reich Minister of Industry and Production"}, {"name": "term_start2", "value": "May 2, 1945"}, {"name": "term_end2", "value": "May 23, 1945"}, {"name": "1blankname2", "value": "Head of state"}, {"name": "1namedata2", "value": "[[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]"}, {"name": "2blankname2", "value": "Head of government"}, {"name": "2namedata2", "value": "[[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]]"}, {"name": "predecessor2", "value": "Position established"}, {"name": "successor2", "value": "Position abolished"}, {"name": "predecessor1", "value": "[[Fritz Todt]] (as Minister of Armaments and Munitions)"}, {"name": "successor1", "value": "[[Karl Saur]] (as Minister of Munitions)"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date|mf=yes|1905|3|19}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Mannheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[German Empire]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|mf=yes|1981|9|1|1905|3|19}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[London]], [[United Kingdom]]"}, {"name": "nationality", "value": "German"}, {"name": "party", "value": "[[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "{{marriage|Margarete Weber|1928|1981}}"}, {"name": "children", "value": "6, including [[Albert Speer (born 1934)|Albert]], [[Hilde Schramm|Hilde]], [[Margret Nissen|Margarete]]"}, {"name": "parents", "value": "{{plainlist|\n* [[Albert Friedrich Speer]]\n* Luise M\u00e1thilde Wilhelmine Hommel\n}}"}, {"name": "alma_mater", "value": "{{plainlist |\n* [[Technical University of Berlin]]\n* [[Technical University of Munich]]\n* [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]\n  }}"}, {"name": "profession", "value": "Architect, government official, author"}, {"name": "cabinet", "value": "[[Hitler Cabinet]]<br />[[Flensburg Government|Schwerin von Krosigk Cabinet]]"}, {"name": "signature", "value": "Albert Speer Signature.svg"}, {"name": "module", "value": "'''Criminal conviction'''{{Infobox criminal\n  |child      = yes\n  |conviction = [[War crimes]] <br />[[Crimes against humanity]]\n| trial       = Nuremberg trials\n| conviction_penalty = 20-years imprisonment\n| conviction_status = \n| victims     = [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Slave laborers]];

Speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin. Speer cancelled some hours before take-off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with Hitler.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=117\u2013118}} Hitler appointed Speer in Todt's place. [[Martin Kitchen]], points out that the choice was not surprising. Speer was loyal to Hitler, and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=120\u2013121}} Hitler also appointed Speer as head of the [[Organisation Todt]], a massive, government-controlled construction company.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=6}} Characteristically Hitler did not give Speer any clear remit; he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control. He proved to be ambitious, unrelenting and ruthless.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} Speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army, but in the whole armed forces.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} It did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nSpeer was f\u00eated at the time, and in the post-war era, for performing an \"armaments miracle\" in which German war production dramatically increased. This \"miracle\" was brought to a halt in the summer of 1943 by, among other factors, the [[Battle of the Ruhr|first]] sustained [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=597\u2013598}} Other factors probably contributed to the increase more than Speer himself. Germany's armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor, Todt. Naval armaments were not under Speer's supervision until October 1943, nor the Luftwaffe's armaments until June of the following year. Yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under Speer's control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=368\u2013370}} Another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Production of every type of weapon peaked in June and July 1944, but there was now a severe shortage of fuel. In September 1944 the Romanian oil fields came into the range of bombers from the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Oil production became so low any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\nAs Minister of Armaments, Speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=127}} With Hitler's full agreement, he decided to prioritize tank production, and he was given unrivalled power to ensure success.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=145\u2013147}} Hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks, but kept changing his mind about the specifications. This delayed the program, and Speer was unable to remedy the situation. In consequence, despite tank production having the highest priority, relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it. This led to a significant German Army failure at the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]], a major turning point on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet [[Red Army]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nAs head of Organisation Todt, Speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps. He agreed to expand [[Auschwitz]] and some other camps, allocating 13.7 million Reichsmarks for the work to be carried out. This allowed an extra 300 huts to be built at Auschwitz, increasing the total human capacity to 132,000. Included in the building works was material to build [[Nazi gas chamber|gas chambers]], crematoria and morgues. The SS called this \"Professor Speer's Special Programme\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=156}}\n\nSpeer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces, there was a labor shortage in the war economy, and not enough workers for his factories. In response, Hitler appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]] as a \"manpower dictator\" to obtain new workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=150}} Speer and Sauckel cooperated closely to meet Speer's labor demands.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=151\u2013152}} Hitler gave Sauckel a free hand to obtain labor, something that delighted Speer, who had requested 1,000,000 \"voluntary\" laborers to meet the need for armament workers. Sauckel had whole villages in France, Holland and Belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to Speer's factories.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=159}} Sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=146\u2013150}} In occupied areas of the Soviet Union, that had been subject to partisan action, civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=165\u2013166}} By April 1943, Sauckel had supplied 1,568,801 \"voluntary\" laborers, forced laborers, prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to Speer for use in his armaments factories. It was for the maltreatment of these people, that Speer was principally convicted at the Nuremberg Trials.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=160}}\n\n===Consolidation of arms production===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28426, A. Speer, E. Milch, W. Messerschmitt.jpg|thumb|Speer with Luftwaffe field marshal [[Erhard Milch]] and aircraft designer [[Willy Messerschmitt]], May 1944]]\nFollowing his appointment as Minister of Armaments, Speer was in control of armaments production solely for the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Army]]. He coveted control of the production of armaments for the [[Luftwaffe]] (airforce) and ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy). He set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7\u20138}} His close relationship with Hitler provided him with political protection, and he was able to outwit and outmanoeuver his rivals in the regime. Hitler's cabinet was dismayed at his tactics, but, regardless, he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7\u20138}} By July 1943, he had gained control of armaments production for the Luftwaffe and ''Kriegsmarine''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=167\u2013169}} In August 1943, he took control of most of the Ministry of Economics, to become, in [[Admiral D\u00f6nitz]]'s words, \"Europe's economic dictator\". His formal title was changed to \"Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production\". He had become one of the most powerful people in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nSpeer and his hand-picked director of submarine construction [[Otto Merker]] believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods, and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=614}} This belief proved incorrect, and Speer and Merker's attempt to build the ''Kriegsmarine''{{'}}s new generation of submarines, the [[Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] and [[Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]], as [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program. The designs were rushed into production, and the completed submarines were crippled by manufacturing flaws which resulted from the way they had been constructed. While dozens of submarines were built, few ever entered service.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=616\u2013618}}\n\nIn December 1943, Speer visited Organisation Todt workers in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], while there he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8\u20139}} He was under the dubious care of Professor [[Karl Gebhardt]] at a medical clinic called Hohenlychen where patients \"mysteriously failed to survive\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=188}} In mid-January 1944, Speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill. Concerned about retaining power, he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the Armaments Ministry from his bedside. Speer's illness coincided with the Allied \"[[Big Week]]\", a series of bombing raids on the German aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=188\u2013189}} His political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with Hitler. He lost Hitler's unconditional support and began to lose power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nIn response to the Allied Big Week, [[Adolf Hitler]] authorized the creation of a [[J\u00e4gerstab|Fighter Staff committee]]. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by the March 1, 1944, orders of Speer, with support from [[Erhard Milch]] of the Reich Aviation Ministry.{{sfn|Boog et al|p=347|2006}} Production of German fighter aircraft more than doubled between 1943 and 1944.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=343}} The growth, however, consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for Allied aircraft.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=582\u2013584}} On August 1, 1944, Speer merged the Fighter Staff into a newly formed [[R\u00fcstungsstab|Armament Staff committee]].{{sfn|Uziel|2012|p=82}}\n\n[[File:\u00dcberlebende KZ M\u00fchldorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Survivors of the [[M\u00fchldorf concentration camp complex|M\u00fchldorf concentration camp]] upon liberation in 1945. M\u00fchldorf supplied slave workers for the [[Weingut I]] project.]]\n\nThe Fighter Staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] in the war economy.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=45|2014}} The SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects from various concentration camps including [[Mittelbau-Dora]]. Prisoners worked for [[Junkers]], [[Messerschmitt]], [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]] and [[BMW#1939\u20131945: World War II|BMW]], among others.{{sfn|Buggeln|pp=46\u201348|2014}} To increase production, Speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce. Those who feigned illness, slacked off, sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps. In 1944 this became endemic; over half a million workers were arrested.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=215}} By this time, 140,000 people were working in Speer's underground factories. These factories were death-traps; discipline was brutal, with regular executions. There were so many corpses at the Dora underground factory, for example, that the crematorium was overwhelmed. Speer's own staff described the conditions there as \"hell\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}\n\nThe largest technological advance under Speer's command came through the rocket program. It began in 1932 but had not supplied any weaponry. Speer enthusiastically supported the program and in March 1942 made an order for A4 rockets, the predecessor of the world's first ballistic missile, the [[V2 rocket]]. The rockets were researched at a facility in [[Peenemunde]] along with the [[V-1 flying bomb]]. The V2's first target was Paris on September 8, 1944. The program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy. The large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=216}} The rockets were built at an underground factory at [[Mittelwerk]]. Labor to build the A4 rockets came from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Of the 60,000 people who ended up at the camp 20,000 died, due to the appalling conditions.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}\n\nBy the summer of 1944 Speer had lost control of Organisation Todt and armaments.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=8}} He opposed the [[20 July plot|assassination attempt against Hitler]] on July 20, 1944. He was not involved in the plot, and played a minor role in the regime's efforts to regain control over Berlin after Hitler survived.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=204\u2013205}} After the plot Speer's rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in the party. He lost yet more authority.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=8}}\n\n===Defeat of Nazi Germany===\n[[File:Nazi Personalities BU6713.jpg|thumb|Speer (left), [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] and [[Alfred Jodl]] (right) after their arrest by the British Army in [[Flensburg]] in Northern Germany in May 1945]]\nLosses of territory and a dramatic expansion of the Allied strategic bombing campaign caused the collapse of the German economy from late 1944. Air attacks on the transport network were particularly effective, as they cut the main centres of production off from essential coal supplies.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=648\u2013651}} In January 1945, Speer told Goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=652}} However, he concluded that the war was lost after Soviet forces captured the important [[Silesia]]n industrial region later that month.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=259}} Nevertheless, Speer believed that Germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the Allies than the [[unconditional surrender]] they insisted upon.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}} During January and February, Speer claimed that his ministry would deliver \"decisive weapons\" and a large increase in armaments production which would \"bring about a dramatic change on the battlefield\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=254}} Speer gained control over the railways in February, and asked Himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nBy mid-March, Speer had accepted that Germany's economy would collapse within the next eight weeks. While he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture, so that they could be used after the war, he still supported the war's continuation. Speer provided Hitler with a memorandum on March 15, which detailed Germany's dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure. Three days later, he also proposed to Hitler that Germany's remaining military resources be concentrated along the [[Rhine]] and [[Vistula]] rivers in an attempt to prolong the fighting. This ignored military realities, as the German armed forces were unable to match the Allies' firepower and were facing total defeat.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=652\u2013653}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=262\u2013263}} Hitler rejected Speer's proposal to cease demolitions. Instead, he issued the \"[[Nero Decree]]\" on March 19, which called for the destruction of all infrastructure as the army retreated. Speer was appalled by this order, and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=265\u2013267}} During a meeting with Speer on March 28/29, Hitler rescinded the decree and gave him authority over demolitions.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=269\u2013270}} Speer ended them, though the army continued to blow up bridges.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=291}}{{efn|For a treatise on this aspect of the war including Speer's involvement see: Randall, Hansen, ''Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance in the Last Year of WWII'', Faber & Faber, 2014, 1st edition, {{ISBN|978-0-571-28451-1}}.}}\n\nBy April, little was left of the armaments industry, and Speer had few official duties.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=275}} Speer visited the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' on April 22 for the last time. He met Hitler and toured the damaged Chancellery before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=263\u2013270}} On April 29, the day before committing suicide, Hitler dictated a [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|final political testament]] which dropped Speer from the successor government. Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl Saur|Karl-Otto Saur]].{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=234}} Speer was disappointed that Hitler had not selected him as his successor.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=277}} After Hitler's death, Speer offered his services to the so-called [[Flensburg government|Flensburg Government]], headed by Hitler's successor, [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]. He took a role in that short-lived regime as Minister of Industry and Production.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=273\u2013281}} Speer provided information to the Allies, regarding the effects of the air war, and on a broad range of subjects, beginning on May 10. On May 23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=288}}\n\n",

"Appointment and increasing power", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16636, Nordeuropa, Eduard Dietl, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|upright|Speer (wearing [[Organisation Todt]] armband) and Wehrmacht general [[Eduard Dietl]] at [[Rovaniemi Airport]] in Finland, December 1943]]\n\nOn February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments [[Fritz Todt]] died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler's [[Wolf's Lair|eastern headquarters]] at [[K\u0119trzyn|Rastenburg]]. Speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin. Speer cancelled some hours before take-off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with Hitler.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=117\u2013118}} Hitler appointed Speer in Todt's place. [[Martin Kitchen]], points out that the choice was not surprising. Speer was loyal to Hitler, and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=120\u2013121}} Hitler also appointed Speer as head of the [[Organisation Todt]], a massive, government-controlled construction company.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=6}} Characteristically Hitler did not give Speer any clear remit; he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control. He proved to be ambitious, unrelenting and ruthless.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} Speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army, but in the whole armed forces.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} It did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nSpeer was f\u00eated at the time, and in the post-war era, for performing an \"armaments miracle\" in which German war production dramatically increased. This \"miracle\" was brought to a halt in the summer of 1943 by, among other factors, the [[Battle of the Ruhr|first]] sustained [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=597\u2013598}} Other factors probably contributed to the increase more than Speer himself. Germany's armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor, Todt. Naval armaments were not under Speer's supervision until October 1943, nor the Luftwaffe's armaments until June of the following year. Yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under Speer's control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=368\u2013370}} Another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Production of every type of weapon peaked in June and July 1944, but there was now a severe shortage of fuel. In September 1944 the Romanian oil fields came into the range of bombers from the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Oil production became so low any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\nAs Minister of Armaments, Speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=127}} With Hitler's full agreement, he decided to prioritize tank production, and he was given unrivalled power to ensure success.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=145\u2013147}} Hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks, but kept changing his mind about the specifications. This delayed the program, and Speer was unable to remedy the situation. In consequence, despite tank production having the highest priority, relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it. This led to a significant German Army failure at the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]], a major turning point on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet [[Red Army]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nAs head of Organisation Todt, Speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps. He agreed to expand [[Auschwitz]] and some other camps, allocating 13.7 million Reichsmarks for the work to be carried out. This allowed an extra 300 huts to be built at Auschwitz, increasing the total human capacity to 132,000. Included in the building works was material to build [[Nazi gas chamber|gas chambers]], crematoria and morgues. The SS called this \"Professor Speer's Special Programme\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=156}}\n\nSpeer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces, there was a labor shortage in the war economy, and not enough workers for his factories. In response, Hitler appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]] as a \"manpower dictator\" to obtain new workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=150}} Speer and Sauckel cooperated closely to meet Speer's labor demands.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=151\u2013152}} Hitler gave Sauckel a free hand to obtain labor, something that delighted Speer, who had requested 1,000,000 \"voluntary\" laborers to meet the need for armament workers. Sauckel had whole villages in France, Holland and Belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to Speer's factories.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=159}} Sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=146\u2013150}} In occupied areas of the Soviet Union, that had been subject to partisan action, civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=165\u2013166}} By April 1943, Sauckel had supplied 1,568,801 \"voluntary\" laborers, forced laborers, prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to Speer for use in his armaments factories. It was for the maltreatment of these people, that Speer was principally convicted at the Nuremberg Trials.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=160}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "117\u2013118"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "120\u2013121"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "6"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "122"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "122"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "148\u2013149"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Tooze"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "597\u2013598"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "368\u2013370"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Tooze"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "575\u2013576"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "232\u2013233"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "127"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "145\u2013147"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "147\u2013148"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "156"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "150"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "151\u2013152"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "159"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Fest"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "146\u2013150"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "165\u2013166"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kitchen"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "160"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Consolidation of arms production", "paragraphs": "[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28426, A. Speer, E. Milch, W. Messerschmitt.jpg|thumb|Speer with Luftwaffe field marshal [[Erhard Milch]] and aircraft designer [[Willy Messerschmitt]], May 1944]]\nFollowing his appointment as Minister of Armaments, Speer was in control of armaments production solely for the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Army]]. He coveted control of the production of armaments for the [[Luftwaffe]] (airforce) and ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy). He set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7\u20138}} His close relationship with Hitler provided him with political protection, and he was able to outwit and outmanoeuver his rivals in the regime. Hitler's cabinet was dismayed at his tactics, but, regardless, he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7\u20138}} By July 1943, he had gained control of armaments production for the Luftwaffe and ''Kriegsmarine''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=167\u2013169}} In August 1943, he took control of most of the Ministry of Economics, to become, in [[Admiral D\u00f6nitz]]'s words, \"Europe's economic dictator\". His formal title was changed to \"Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production\". He had become one of the most powerful people in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nSpeer and his hand-picked director of submarine construction [[Otto Merker]] believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods, and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=614}} This belief proved incorrect, and Speer and Merker's attempt to build the ''Kriegsmarine''{{'}}s new generation of submarines, the [[Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] and [[Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]], as [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program. The designs were rushed into production, and the completed submarines were crippled by manufacturing flaws which resulted from the way they had been constructed. While dozens of submarines were built, few ever entered service.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=616\u2013618}}\n\nIn December 1943, Speer visited Organisation Todt workers in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], while there he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8\u20139}} He was under the dubious care of Professor [[Karl Gebhardt]] at a medical clinic called Hohenlychen where patients \"mysteriously failed to survive\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=188}} In mid-January 1944, Speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill. Concerned about retaining power, he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the Armaments Ministry from his bedside. Speer's illness coincided with the Allied \"[[Big Week]]\", a series of bombing raids on the German aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=188\u2013189}} His political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with Hitler. He lost Hitler's unconditional support and began to lose power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nIn response to the Allied Big Week, [[Adolf Hitler]] authorized the creation of a [[J\u00e4gerstab|Fighter Staff committee]]. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by the March 1, 1944, orders of Speer, with support from [[Erhard Milch]] of the Reich Aviation Ministry.{{sfn|Boog et al|p=347|2006}} Production of German fighter aircraft more than doubled between 1943 and 1944.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=343}} The growth, however, consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for Allied aircraft.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=582\u2013584}} On August 1, 1944, Speer merged the Fighter Staff into a newly formed [[R\u00fcstungsstab|Armament Staff committee]].{{sfn|Uziel|2012|p=82}}\n\n[[File:\u00dcberlebende KZ M\u00fchldorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Survivors of the [[M\u00fchldorf concentration camp complex|M\u00fchldorf concentration camp]] upon liberation in 1945. M\u00fchldorf supplied slave workers for the [[Weingut I]] project.]]\n\nThe Fighter Staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] in the war economy.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=45|2014}} The SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects from various concentration camps including [[Mittelbau-Dora]]. Prisoners worked for [[Junkers]], [[Messerschmitt]], [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]] and [[BMW#1939\u20131945: World War II|BMW]], among others.{{sfn|Buggeln|pp=46\u201348|2014}} To increase production, Speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce. Those who feigned illness, slacked off, sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps. In 1944 this became endemic; over half a million workers were arrested.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=215}} By this time, 140,000 people were working in Speer's underground factories. These factories were death-traps; discipline was brutal, with regular executions. There were so many corpses at the Dora underground factory, for example, that the crematorium was overwhelmed. Speer's own staff described the conditions there as \"hell\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}\n\nThe largest technological advance under Speer's command came through the rocket program. It began in 1932 but had not supplied any weaponry. Speer enthusiastically supported the program and in March 1942 made an order for A4 rockets, the predecessor of the world's first ballistic missile, the [[V2 rocket]]. The rockets were researched at a facility in [[Peenemunde]] along with the [[V-1 flying bomb]]. The V2's first target was Paris on September 8, 1944. The program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy. The large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=216}} The rockets were built at an underground factory at [[Mittelwerk]]. Labor to build the A4 rockets came from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp.

There was no communication.\"{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=664\u2013665}} He supported Hermann, his brother, financially after the war.

It had been edited by Wolters and made no mention of the Jews.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=339\u2013343}} [[David Irving]] discovered discrepancies between the deceptively edited ''Chronicle'' and independent documents. Speer asked Wolters to destroy the material he had omitted from his donation but Wolters refused and retained an original copy.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=226\u2013227}} Wolters' friendship with Speer deteriorated and one year before Speer's death Wolters gave Matthias Schmidt access to the unedited ''Chronicle''. Schmidt authored the first book that was highly critical of Speer.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=359\u2013361}}\n\nSpeer's memoirs were a phenomenal success. The public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight.

Speer liked the scenario so much that he wrote it into his memoirs. The journalist had unwittingly collaborated in one of his myths.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}}\n\nSpeer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of Hitler's leadership. Despite his opposition to the [[20 July plot]], he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to the plotters. He maintained Hitler was cool towards him for the remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers. This formed a key element of the myths Speer encouraged.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=205}} Speer also falsely claimed that he had realised the war was lost at an early stage, and thereafter worked to preserve the resources needed for the civilian population's survival.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}} In reality, he had sought to prolong the war until further resistance was impossible, thus contributing to the large number of deaths and the extensive destruction Germany suffered in the conflict's final months.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}}{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=653}}\n\n===Denial of responsibility===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-207, KZ Mauthausen, H\u00e4ftlinge bei der Desinfektion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group several hundred naked men is crowded in an enclosed courtyard, with garage doors visible on three sides.|New prisoners awaiting disinfection in the garage yard of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex|Mauthausen concentration camp]]]]\nSpeer maintained at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the Holocaust. He admitted only to being uncomfortable around Jews in the published version of the ''Spandau Diaries''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=322}} More broadly, Speer accepted responsibility for the Nazi regime's actions. Historian Martin Kitchen states that Speer was actually \"fully aware of what had happened to the Jews\" and was \"intimately involved in the '[[Final Solution]]'\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=100, 322}} Brechtken said Speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the Holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Speer was photographed with slave laborers at [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] in 1942. Taylor writes had the photo been available at the Nuremberg trials he would have been hanged.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=204-205}} In 2005, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were massacred.{{sfn|Connolly|2005}} Heinrich Breloer, discussing the construction of Auschwitz, said Speer was not just a cog in the work\u2014he was the \"terror itself\".{{sfn|Connolly|2005}}\n\nSpeer denied being present at the [[Posen speeches]] to Nazi leaders at a conference in Posen ([[Poznan]]) on October 6, 1943. Himmler said during his speech, \"The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth\".,{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=167\u2013168}} and later, \"The Jews must be exterminated\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=345}} Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler addresses him directly.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=345}} In 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a letter from Speer dated December 23, 1971, had been found in a collection of his correspondence with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jeanty, the widow of a Belgian resistance fighter. In the letter, Speer says, \"There is no doubt\u2014I was present as Himmler announced on October 6, 1943, that all Jews would be killed.\"{{sfn|Connolly|2007}}\n\n===Armaments \"miracle\"===\n[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|right|The German city of Cologne in ruins at the end of the war]]\nSpeer was credited with an \"armaments miracle\". During the winter of 1941&ndash;42, in the light of Germany's disastrous defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]], the German leadership including Fromm, Thomas and Todt had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}} The rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end the war without defeat. Speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of the war economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}} He produced spectacular statistics, claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production, a fourfold increase in artillery production, and he sent further propaganda to the newsreels of the country. He was able to curtail the discussion that the war should be ended.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}}\n\nThe armaments \"miracle\" was a myth; Speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=555}} The production of armaments did go up; however, this was due to the normal causes of reorganization before Speer came to office, the relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in the quality of output to favor quantity. By July 1943 Speer's armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on the battlefield meant the prospect of losing the war could no longer be hidden from the German public.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=552\u2013557}} Brechtken writes that Speer knew Germany was going to lose the war and deliberately extended its length, thus causing the deaths of millions of people in the death camps and on the battlefield who would have otherwise lived.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Kitchen said \"There can be no doubt that Speer did indeed help to prolong the war longer than many thought possible, as a result of which millions were killed and Germany reduced to a pile of rubble\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=364}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value":
