Preparing to depart from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], a port in [[Boeotia]], Agamemnon's army incurred the wrath of the goddess [[Artemis]]. There are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath: in [[Aeschylus]]' play ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', Artemis is angry for the young men who will die at Troy, whereas in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', Agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to Artemis, and subsequently boasted that he was Artemis' equal in hunting. Misfortunes, including a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and a lack of wind, prevented the army from sailing. Finally, the prophet [[Calchas]] announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter [[Iphigenia]].\n\n[[File:Achilles Briseis MAN Napoli Inv9105 n01.jpg|thumb|[[Achilles]]' surrender of [[Briseis]] to Agamemnon, from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, 1st century AD, now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]\n\nClassical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate; some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to [[Achilles]], but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis, and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the [[human sacrifice]] have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources, such as ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'', say that Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but that Artemis accepted a deer in her place, and whisked her away to Tauris in the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. [[Hesiod]] said she became the goddess [[Hecate]].\n\nAgamemnon was the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Greeks during the Trojan War. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed [[Antiphus]] and fifteen other Trojan soldiers, according to one source.<ref>[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 114.</ref> But in the \"[[Iliad]]\" itself, he's shown to slaughter hundreds more in Book 11 during his ''aristea'' loosely translated to \"day of glory\" which is the most similar to Achilles' ''aristea'' in Book 21 (they both are compared to lions and destructive fires in battle, their hands are described as \"splattered with gore\" and \"invincible,\" the Trojans flee to the walls, they both are appealed to by one of their victims, they are both avoided by Hector, they both get wounded in the arm or hand, and they both kill the one who wounded them). Even before his ''aristea,'' Agamemnon was considered to be one of the three best warriors on the Greek side as proven when Hector challenges any champion of the Greek side to fight him in Book 7, and Agamemnon (along with Diomedes and Big Aias) is one of the three most wished for to face him out of the nine strongest Greek warriors who volunteered. And after they reconciled, even Achilles admits in Book 23 that Agamemnon is \"the best in strength and in throwing the spear.\" That claim is further proven by the fact that Agamemnon was the only major warrior on either side never to need the gods' direct intervention to increase his strength or give him any unfair advantages in battle and yet he still caused incredible destruction almost on the scale of Achilles.\n\nThe ''[[Iliad]]'' tells the story about the quarrel between Agamemnon and [[Achilles]] in the final year of the war. Following one of the Achaean Army's raids, [[Chryseis]], daughter of [[Chryses]], one of Apollo's priests, was taken as a war prize by Agamemnon. Chryses pleaded with Agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success. Chryses then prayed to Apollo for the safe return of his daughter, which Apollo responded to by unleashing a plague over the Achaean Army. After learning from the Prophet Calchas that the plague could be dispelled by returning Chryseis to her father, Agamemnon reluctantly agreed (but first berated Calchas for previously forcing Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia) and released his prize. However, as compensation for his lost prize, Agamemnon demanded a new prize. He stole an attractive slave called [[Briseis]], one of the spoils of war, from Achilles.<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'' Translated by Robert Fagles, Penguin Classics, 1998</ref>\n\nIn response to being deprived of Briseis, Achilles withdrew from battle and put the Greek armies at risk of losing the war. Agamemnon, having realized Achilles's importance in winning the war against the Trojan Army, sent ambassadors begging for Achilles to return, offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage, but Achilles refused, only being spurred back into action when his closest friend, [[Patroclus]], was killed in battle.\n\nAlthough not the equal of Achilles in bravery, Agamemnon was a representative of \"kingly authority\". As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. His chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness; an over-exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult [[Chryses]] and Achilles, thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAfter the capture of Troy, [[Cassandra]], the doomed prophetess and daughter of [[Priam]], fell to Agamemnon's lot in the distribution of the prizes of war.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main article", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Trojan War"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": " Return to Greece ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Aegisthus.jpg|thumb|[[Orestes]] slaying [[Clytemnestra]]]]\nAfter a stormy voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra landed in [[Argolis]], or, in another version, were blown off course and landed in Aegisthus' country.

When Agamemnon came home he was slain by Aegisthus (in the oldest versions of the story)<ref>Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'' 3:266</ref> or by Clytemnestra.

Agamemnon's son [[Orestes]] later avenged his father's murder, with the help or encouragement of his sister [[Electra]], by murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra (his own mother), thereby inciting the wrath of the [[Erinyes]] (English: the Furies), winged goddesses who tracked down wrongdoers with their hounds' noses and drove them to insanity.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": " Other stories ", "paragraphs": "[[Athenaeus]] tells a tale of how Agamemnon mourned the loss of his friend or lover [[Argynnus]], when he drowned in the [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Cephisus]] river.<ref name=ArgynnusLD>{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Charlton T.|author2=Short, Charles|title=Argynnus|work=[[A Latin Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Perseus Project]]|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DArgynnus|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> He buried him, honored with a tomb and a shrine to [[Aphrodite]] Argynnis.<ref>''The Deipnosophists of [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]'', Book XIII Concerning Women, 80D (p. 603)</ref> This episode is also found in [[Clement of Alexandria]],<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'' II.38.2</ref> in [[Stephen of Byzantium]] ''(Kopai'' and ''Argunnos),'' and in [[Propertius]], III with minor variations.<ref>Butler, Harold Edgeworth & Barber, Eric Arthur, eds.
