The cooking traditions vary especially between the north and the south owing to differing [[topography]] and [[climate]] that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of [[herb]]s, [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Albania Mania|url=http://agroweb.org/archive//?id=10&l=248&ln=en&url=albania-mania|website=agroweb.org|language=English}}</ref> \n \n[[Albanians]] produce and use many varieties of [[fruit]]s such as [[Lemon (fruit)|lemon]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[Figs (fruit)|fig]]s and most notably [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]s which is perhaps the most important element of Albanian cooking. [[Spice]]s and other [[herb]]s such as [[Basil (herb)|basil]], [[lavender]], [[Spearmint|mint]], [[oregano]], [[rosemary]] and [[thyme]] are widely used, as are [[vegetable]]s such as [[garlic]]s, [[onion]]s, [[Bell pepper|pepper]]s, [[potato]]es and [[tomato]]es as well as [[legume]]s of all types.\n\nHaving a coastline along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast|Adriatic]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s and [[seafood]] are a popular and an integral part of the Albanian diet. Otherwise [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] is the traditional [[meat]] for different [[holiday]]s and [[religious festival]]s for both [[Christians]] and [[Muslim]]s, and [[poultry]], [[beef]], and [[pork]] are also in plentiful supply.\n\n[[Tav\u00eb Kosi]] is a national dish in Albania and consists of garlicky lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of [[yogurt]]. [[F\u00ebrges\u00eb of Tirana with Peppers|F\u00ebrges\u00eb]] is another national dish in the country and is made up with peppers, tomatoes and [[cottage cheese]]. Another beloved dish is Pite which is generally a filled and baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of [[spinach]] and [[curd|gjiz\u00eb]] or [[Ground meat|mish]] as it is known in Albania.\n\n[[File:Buk\u00eb_kollomoqe,_buk\u00eb_misri.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cornbread|Buk\u00eb Misri]] is a staple on the Albanian table.]]\n\nPetulla, a traditionally fried dough, is as well a popular speciality and is served with [[powdered sugar]] or [[feta cheese]] and different sorts of [[Fruit preserves|fruit jam]]s. Also popular is [[Flia]] consisting of multiple crepe-like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream. Krofne, similar to [[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]], are filled with jam, or chocolate and often eaten during the cold winter months.\n\n[[Coffee]] is very much a part of the people's lifestyle in Albania. Different variations of coffee is best enjoyed within the family or friends but also outside at caf\u00e9s or bars. A small country in size, Albania ranked first with the most coffee houses per capita in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocnal.com/2018/02/albania-ranked-first-in-world-for.html|title=Albania ranked first in the World for the number of Bars and Restaurants per inhabitant}}</ref>\n\n[[Tea]] is enjoyed both at home or outside at caf\u00e9s, bars or restaurants. [[Sideritis|\u00c7aj Mali]] is enormously beloved and is part of a daily routine for most of the Albanians. It is cultivated across Southern Albania and noted for its medicinal properties. [[Black tea]] with a slice of lemon and sugar, milk or honey is also a popular type of tea.\n\n[[Albanian wine|Wine]] drinking is popular throughout the Albanians.

Major cities in Albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [[architectural style]]s. In the 20th century, many historical as well as [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [[Communism in Albania|communist era]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg \u2013 [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania \u2013 An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|page=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient architecture]] is found throughout Albania and most visible in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkod\u00ebr]] and [[Durr\u00ebs Amphitheatre|Durr\u00ebs]]. Considering the long period of rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]], they introduced castles, citadels, churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of visible [[mural]]s and [[fresco]]s. Perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopoj\u00eb]] and [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]].

The 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern [[Italianate architecture|Italian style]], which is present in [[Tirana]] such as the [[Skanderbeg Square]] and Ministries. It is also present in Shkod\u00ebr, [[Vlor\u00eb]], [[Sarand\u00eb]] and [[Durr\u00ebs]]. Moreover, other towns received their present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or economic influences.\n\n[[Socialist classicism]] arrived during the [[Peoples Republic of Albania|communist era]] in Albania after the [[Second World War]]. At this period many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic and important buildings demolished. Notable examples of that style include the [[Mother Teresa Square (Tirana)|Mother Teresa Square]], [[Pyramid of Tirana]], [[Palace of Congresses]] and so on.\n\nThree Albanian archaeological sites are included in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged tone of the north and the relaxed form of the south.\n\nMany of the songs are about events from [[History of Albania|history]] and [[Culture of Albania|culture]], including the traditional themes about honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge. The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two [[Himara|Himariot]] musicians [[Ne\u00e7o Muko|Ne\u00e7o Muka]] and Ko\u00e7o \u00c7akali in [[Paris]], during their interpretations with the song [[Tefta Tashko-Ko\u00e7o|Diva Tefta Tashko Ko\u00e7o]].

The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the [[German language]]. [[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.\nThe earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pag\u00ebzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Pal Engj\u00eblli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.\n\n[[File:Parashqevi-qirjazi_152_186.jpg|thumb|[[Parashqevi Qiriazi]] teacher and feminist (1880\u20131970)]]\n\nAlbanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|Siege of Shkod\u00ebr]] (''Rrethimi i Shkodr\u00ebs'') from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti|Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis]] (''History of Skanderbeg'') from 1508. The ''History of Skanderbeg'' is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.\n\nDuring the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] (''E mb\u00ebsuame krishter\u00eb'') (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [[Lek\u00eb Matr\u00ebnga]], (''Doktrina e krishter\u00eb'') (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (''Rituale romanum'') 1621 by [[Pjet\u00ebr Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

During communism, the Albanian Film Institute that later became known as [[Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] was founded with Soviet assistance, focusing mostly on propaganda of wartime struggles. After 1945, the [[communist state|communist government]] founded the [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] in 1952. This was followed by the first Albanian [[epic film]], the [[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg|Great Warrior Skanderbeg]], a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]]. In addition the film was awarded the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nBy 1990, about 200 movies had been produced, and Albania had over 450 theaters. With the economic transition after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the Kinostudio was broken up and privatised. A new [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|National Center of Cinematography]] was established, while cities built modern cinema theatres showing mostly American movies. The [[Tirana International Film Festival]] was established in 2003 and has become the premier and largest film festival in the country as well as in the Balkans.

[[F\u00ebrges\u00eb of Tirana with Peppers|F\u00ebrges\u00eb]] is another national dish in the country and is made up with peppers, tomatoes and [[cottage cheese]].

Also popular is [[Flia]] consisting of multiple crepe-like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream. Krofne, similar to [[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]], are filled with jam, or chocolate and often eaten during the cold winter months.\n\n[[Coffee]] is very much a part of the people's lifestyle in Albania. Different variations of coffee is best enjoyed within the family or friends but also outside at caf\u00e9s or bars.

Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [[architectural style]]s. In the 20th century, many historical as well as [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [[Communism in Albania|communist era]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg \u2013 [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania \u2013 An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|page=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient architecture]] is found throughout Albania and most visible in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkod\u00ebr]] and [[Durr\u00ebs Amphitheatre|Durr\u00ebs]].

The 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern [[Italianate architecture|Italian style]], which is present in [[Tirana]] such as the [[Skanderbeg Square]] and Ministries. It is also present in Shkod\u00ebr, [[Vlor\u00eb]], [[Sarand\u00eb]] and [[Durr\u00ebs]]. Moreover, other towns received their present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or economic influences.\n\n[[Socialist classicism]] arrived during the [[Peoples Republic of Albania|communist era]] in Albania after the [[Second World War]]. At this period many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic and important buildings demolished.

The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the [[German language]]. [[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.\nThe earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pag\u00ebzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Pal Engj\u00eblli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.\n\n[[File:Parashqevi-qirjazi_152_186.jpg|thumb|[[Parashqevi Qiriazi]] teacher and feminist (1880\u20131970)]]\n\nAlbanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|Siege of Shkod\u00ebr]] (''Rrethimi i Shkodr\u00ebs'') from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti|Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis]] (''History of Skanderbeg'') from 1508. The ''History of Skanderbeg'' is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.\n\nDuring the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] (''E mb\u00ebsuame krishter\u00eb'') (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [[Lek\u00eb Matr\u00ebnga]], (''Doktrina e krishter\u00eb'') (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (''Rituale romanum'') 1621 by [[Pjet\u00ebr Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably [[Ismail Kadare]].

After 1945, the [[communist state|communist government]] founded the [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] in 1952. This was followed by the first Albanian [[epic film]], the [[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg|Great Warrior Skanderbeg]], a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]]. In addition the film was awarded the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nBy 1990, about 200 movies had been produced, and Albania had over 450 theaters. With the economic transition after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the Kinostudio was broken up and privatised. A new [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|National Center of Cinematography]] was established, while cities built modern cinema theatres showing mostly American movies.

Football arrived in Albania early in the 20th century when the inhabitants of the northern city of [[Shkod\u00ebr]] were surprised to see a strange game being played by students at a Christian mission.\n\nThe [[Albania national football team]], ranking 51st in the [[FIFA World Rankings|World]] in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22 August 2015) have won the [[1946 Balkan Cup]] and the [[Rothmans International Tournament 2000|Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000]], but had never participated in any major [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournament, until [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament. Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured their first ever win in European Championship when they beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]] by 1\u20130 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] match on 19 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/19/albania-vs-romania-euro-2016---live/|title=Euro 2016: Albania 0\u20131 Romania \u2013 Armando Sadiku scores the only goal to seal his country's first ever win at a major competition|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/romania-0-1-albania-armando-8233364|title=Romania 0\u20131 Albania \u2013 Sadiku scores landmark goal to provide last 16 hope|date=19 June 2016|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> The most successful football clubs in the country are [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]], [[KF Tirana]], [[FK Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]], [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani]] and [[KF Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]].\n\nWeightlifting is one of the most successful individual sport for the Albanians, with the national team winning medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships]] and the rest international competitions.
