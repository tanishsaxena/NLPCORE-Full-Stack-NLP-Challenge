If, in a single instance, this supreme being was represented in connection with powers of subordinate rank, nothing could have been more natural than to represent it also in combination with its emanations, the seven superior spirits, the thirty Aeons, and the three hundred and sixty-five cosmical Genii; and yet this occurs upon none of the relics as yet discovered, whilst those with Powers not belonging to the Gnostic system are frequently met with.\n*'''Abrasax with Jewish symbols.''' This combination predominates, not indeed with symbolical figures, but in the form of inscriptions, such as: ''[[Archon#Gnosticism|Iao]], [[Elohim|Eloai]], [[Adonai]], [[Sabaoth]], Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Onoel, Ananoel, Raphael, Japlael'', and many others.

Beside an Abrasax figure the following, for instance, is found: \u0399\u0391\u03a9 \u0391\u0392\u03a1\u0391\u03a3\u0391\u039e \u0391\u0394\u03a9\u039d \u0391\u03a4\u0391, \"Iao Abrasax, thou art the Lord\".<ref>Bellermann, ''Versuch,'' iii., No. 10.</ref> With the Abrasax-shield are also found the divine names Sabaoth Iao, Iao Abrasax, Adonai Abrasax, etc.<ref>Baudissin, ''Studien zur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte,'' i. 189 et seq.</ref>\n*'''Abrasax with Persian deities.''' Chiefly, perhaps exclusively, in combination with [[Mithras]], and possibly a few specimens with the mystical gradations of ''mithriaca'', upon Gnostic relics.\n*'''Abrasax with Egyptian deities.''' It is represented as a figure, with the sun-god Phre leading his chariot, or standing upon a lion borne by a crocodile; also as a name, in connection with [[Isis]], [[Ptah|Phtha]], [[Neith]], [[Hathor|Athor]], [[Thoth|Thot]], [[Anubis]], [[Horus]], and [[Harpocrates]] in a Lotus-leaf; also with a representation of the Nile, the symbol of prolificacy, with [[Agathodaemon]] ([[Chnuphis]]), or with [[scarabs]], the symbols of the revivifying energies of nature.\n*'''Abrasax with Grecian deities''', sometimes as a figure, and again with the simple name, in connection with the planets, especially [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Hecate]], and [[Zeus (mythology)|Zeus]], richly engraved.\n*'''Simple or ornamental representations of the journey of departed spirits through the starry world to [[Amenti]]''', borrowed, as those above-named, from the Egyptian religion. The spirit wafted from the earth, either with or without the corpse, and transformed at times into [[Osiris]] or [[Helios]], is depicted as riding upon the back of a crocodile, or lion, guided in some instances by Anubis, and other genii, and surrounded by stars; and thus attended hastening to judgment and a higher life.\n*'''Representations of the [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgment]]''', which, like the preceding, are either ornamental or plain, and imitations of Egyptian art, with slight modifications and prominent symbols, as the vessel in which Anubis weighs the human heart, as comprehending the entire life of man, with all its errors.\n*'''Worship and consecrating services''' were, according to the testimony of [[Origen]] in his description of tho [[Ophite Diagrams|ophitic diagram]], conducted with figurative representations in the secret assemblies of the Gnostics unless indeed the statement on which this opinion rests designates, as it readily may, a statue of glyptic workmanship. It is uncertain if any of the discovered specimens actually represent the Gnostic cultus and religious ceremonies, although upon some may be seen an Abrasax-figure laying its hand upon a person kneeling, as though for baptism or benediction.\n*'''Astrological groups'''. The Gnostics referred everything to astrology. Even the Bardesenists located the inferior powers, the seven, twelve and thirty-six, among the planets, in the zodiac and starry region, as rulers of the celestial phenomena which influence the earth and its inhabitants. Birth and health, wealth and allotment, are considered to be mainly under their control. Other sects betray still stronger partiality for astrological conceits. Many of these specimens also are improperly ascribed to Gnosticism, but the Gnostic origin of others is too manifest to allow of contradiction.\n*'''Inscriptions''', of which there are three kinds:\n**Those destitute of symbols or iconisms, engraved upon stone, iron, lead and silver plates, in Greek, Latin, Coptic or other languages, of amuletic import, and in the form of prayers for health and protection.\n**Those with some symbol, as a serpent in an oval form.\n**Those with iconisms, at times very small, but often made the prominent object, so that the legend is limited to a single word or name. Sometimes the legends are as important as the images. It is remarkable, however, that thus far none of the plates or medals found seem to have any of the forms or prayers reported by Origen. It is necessary to distinguish those specimens that belong to the proper Gnostic period from such as are indisputably of later origin, especially since there is a strong temptation to place those of more recent date among the older class.\n\n===Gallery===\n\n<gallery caption=\"Prints from [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'' (Band 2,2) page 358 ff.\">\nFile:Montfaucon 358 Abraxas.xcf|Plaque 144\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 145.xcf|Plaque 145\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 146.xcf|Plaque 146\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 147.xcf|Plaque 147\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 148.xcf|Plaque 148\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 149.xcf|Plaque 149\n</gallery>\n\n=== Anguipede ===\n[[File:Abraxas, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|Engraving from an Abrasax stone.]]\nIn a great majority of instances the name Abrasax is associated with a singular composite figure, having a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]-like appearance somewhat resembling a [[basilisk]] or the Greek primordial god [[Chronos]] (not to be confused with the Greek titan [[Cronus]]).

During the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense Gnostic, or specially Basilidian, or connected with Abrasax. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes:<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\">{{catholic|wstitle=Abrasax|inline=yes|last=Leclercq|first=Henri|volume=1|year=1913}}</ref>\n* ''Abrasax'', or stones of Basilidian origin<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\"/>\n* ''Abrasaxtes'', or stones originating in ancient forms of worship and adapted by the Gnostics<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\"/>\n* ''Abraxo\u00efdes'', or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of Basilides<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\"/>\n\nWhile it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of Gnostics, there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin. The fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what Irenaeus says about the followers of Basilides:\n\n{{quote|These men, moreover, practise magic, and use images, incantations, invocations, and every other kind of curious art.

[[Isaac de Beausobre]] properly calls attention to the significant silence of [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] in the two passages in which he instructs the Christians of [[Alexandria]] on the right use of rings and gems, and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them (''Paed''. 241 ff.; 287 ff.). But no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of Gnostic mythology has had any success, and ''Abrasax'' is the only Gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies. The present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the Basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown.\n\n=== Magical papyri ===\nHaving due regard to the [[Greek Magical Papyri|magic papyri]], in which many of the unintelligible names of the Abrasax-stones reappear, besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic.\n\nThe magic papyri reflect the same ideas as the Abrasax-gems and often bear Hebraic names of God.<ref name=\"BlauKohler\"/> The following example is illustrative: \"I conjure you by [[Yahweh|Ia\u014d]] [[Sabaoth|Saba\u014dth]] [[Adonai|Ad\u014dnai]] Abrasax, and by the great god, [[Yahweh|Iae\u014d]]\".<ref name=\"Betz\">ed.

Similarly, entities considered angels in Judaism are invoked as gods alongside Abrasax: thus \"I conjure you... by the god [[Michael (archangel)|Micha\u0113l]], by the god [[Sariel|Souri\u0113l]], by the god [[Gabriel|Gabri\u0113l]], by the god [[Raphael (archangel)|Rapha\u0113l]], by the god Abrasax Ablathanalba Akrammachari...\".<ref name=\"Betz\" />\n\nIn text PGM V. 96-172, Abrasax is identified as part of the \"true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of Israel\" of the \"Headless One, who created heaven and earth, who created night and day...

His first laughter created light; his second divided the [[Nu (mythology)|primordial waters]]; his third created the mind; his fourth created fertility and procreation; his fifth created fate; his sixth created time (as the sun and moon); and his seventh and final laughter created the soul.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> Then, from various sounds made by Abrasax, there arose the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]] who \"foreknew all things\", the first man (or [[Phobos (mythology)|Fear]]), and the god [[Yahweh|Ia\u014d]], \"who is lord of all\".<ref name=\"Betz\" /> The man fought with Ia\u014d, and Abrasax declared that Ia\u014d's power would derive from both of the others, and that Ia\u014d would take precedence over all the other gods.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> This text also describes [[Helios]] as an archangel of God/Abrasax.<ref name=\"Betz\" />\n\nThe [[Leyden papyrus X|Leyden Papyrus]] recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon:\n{{quote|[24] Ho!
