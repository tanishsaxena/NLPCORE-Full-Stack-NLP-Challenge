Solzhenitsyn was an outspoken critic of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Communism]] and helped to raise global awareness of its [[Gulag]] labor camp system.\n\nAfter serving in the Soviet Army during World War II, he was sentenced to spend eight years in a labour camp and then [[internal exile]] for criticizing [[Josef Stalin]] in a private letter. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, the novel ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' (1962). Although the reforms brought by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] freed him from exile in 1956, the publication of ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' (1968), ''[[August 1914 (novel)|August 1914]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' (1973) beyond the Soviet Union angered authorities, and Solzhenitsyn lost his Soviet citizenship in 1974. He was flown to West Germany, and in 1976 he moved with his family to the United States, where he continued to write. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], his citizenship was restored in 1990, and four years later he returned to Russia, where he remained until his death in 2008.\n\nHe was awarded the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \"for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature\".<ref name=\"Noble\">{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1970/ |title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1970|publisher=Nobel Foundation | accessdate =17 October 2008}}</ref> His ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was a highly influential work that \"amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Scammell |first1=Michael |title=The Writer Who Destroyed an Empire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/opinion/solzhenitsyn-soviet-union-putin.html |agency=NYT |publisher=NYT |date=11 December 2018 |quote=In 1973, still in the Soviet Union, he sent abroad his literary and polemical masterpiece, \"The Gulag Archipelago.\" The nonfiction account exposed the enormous crimes that had led to the wholesale incarceration and slaughter of millions of innocent victims, demonstrating that its dimensions were on a par with the Holocaust.

These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.\n\n''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West.  It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West\u2014not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for \"libelous speech\" about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Later years in the Soviet Union ===\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em | align = right\n| quote = Every time when we speak about Solzhenitsyn as the enemy of the Soviet regime, this just happens to coincide with some important [international] events and we postpone the decision.\n| source = [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]], a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] member.}}\n\nSolzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to have his novel ''Cancer Ward'' legally published in the Soviet Union. This required the approval of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Writers]]. Though some there appreciated it, the work was ultimately denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Oak and the Calf| title-link = The Oak and the Calf}}</ref>\n\nAfter Krushchev's removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. Publishing of Solzhenitsyn's work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a [[non-person]], and, by 1965, the [[KGB]] had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of ''The First Circle''. Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most well-known of all his writings, ''The Gulag Archipelago''.  The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an \"officially acclaimed\" writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\nAfter the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965\u201367, the preparatory drafts of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in [[Estonia]]. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended [[Arnold Susi]], a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] Prison cell.

In 1970, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He could not receive the prize personally in [[Stockholm]] at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow.  The Swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish-Soviet relations. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union.\n\n''The Gulag Archipelago'' was composed from 1958 to 1967.  It was a three-volume, seven-part work on the Soviet prison camp system.

After the KGB harassment in Z\u00fcrich, Solzhenitsyn settled in [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont, reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a [[barbed wire]] fence.  His influence and [[moral authority]] for the West diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of Western individualism.

By 1992, four \"knots\" (parts) had been completed and he had also written several shorter works.\n\nDespite spending almost two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother.{{Citation needed | date= August 2008}} More importantly, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well-received in Western conservative circles (e.g. Ford administration staffers [[Richard Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] advocated on Solzhenitsyn's behalf for him to speak directly to President [[Gerald Ford]] about the Soviet threat),<ref>{{cite book| last1 =Mann | first1 = James | last2 = Mann | first2 = Jim | title= Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet|url=https://archive.org/details/riseofvulcanshis00mannrich| url-access =registration |year=2004|publisher=Penguin |isbn = 978-0-14-303489-6 | pages= [https://archive.org/details/riseofvulcanshis00mannrich/page/64 64]\u201366}}</ref> prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by US President [[Ronald Reagan]]. At the same time, liberals and [[secularism|secularists]] became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his [[reactionary]] preference for [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] religion.\n\nSolzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant [[popular culture|pop culture]] of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: \"...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits... by TV stupor and by intolerable music.\" Despite his criticism of the \"weakness\" of the West, Solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of Western democratic societies. In a major speech delivered to the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993, Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to \"lose sight of its own values, its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law\u2014a hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen.\"<ref>[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] p. 599</ref>\n\nIn a series of writings, speeches, and interviews after his return to his native Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self-government he had witnessed first hand in Switzerland and New England.<ref>\"Russia in Collapse\" in [[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 480\u20131</ref><ref>\"The Cavendish Farewell\" in [[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 606\u201307</ref> He \"praised 'the sensible and sure process of [[grassroots democracy]], in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own, not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities.'\"<ref>{{Citation | author-link = Bill Kauffman| last = Kauffman | first = William 'Bill' | date = 19 December 2005 | url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ | title = Free Vermont | newspaper = [[The American Conservative]]}}</ref> Solzhenitsyn's patriotism was inward-looking.

Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his eldest son Yermolai returned to Russia). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a [[dacha]] in [[Troitse-Lykovo]] in west Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders [[Mikhail Suslov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. A staunch believer in traditional Russian culture, Solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post-Soviet Russia in works such as ''Rebuilding Russia'', and called for the establishment of a strong presidential republic balanced by vigorous institutions of local self-government.

Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret.

We must root out this evil.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = Benno | first = Peter | year = 1965 | chapter = The Political Aspect | editor1-first = Max | editor1-last = Hayward | editor2-first = Edward L | editor2-last = Crowley | title = Soviet Literature in the 1960s | place = London | page = 191}}</ref> The book quickly sold out and became an instant hit.{{Citation needed|date= July 2011}} In the 1960s, while he was publicly known to be writing ''Cancer Ward'', he was simultaneously writing ''The Gulag Archipelago''. During Khrushchev's tenure, ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' was studied in schools in the Soviet Union, as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn's, including his short story \"[[Matryona's Place|Matryona's Home]]\", published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.\n\n''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West.  It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West\u2014not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for \"libelous speech\" about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041204155242/http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "4 December 2004"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1970"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Laureates"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Literature"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Nobel prize"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "14 February 2010"}]}, {"name": "Citation ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Benno"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Peter"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1965"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "The Political Aspect"}, {"name": "editor1-first", "value": "Max"}, {"name": "editor1-last", "value": "Hayward"}, {"name": "editor2-first", "value": "Edward L"}, {"name": "editor2-last", "value": "Crowley"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Soviet Literature in the 1960s"}, {"name": "place", "value": "London"}, {"name": "page", "value": "191"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2011"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2015"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": " Later years in the Soviet Union ", "paragraphs": "\n{{quote box | width = 22em | align = right\n| quote = Every time when we speak about Solzhenitsyn as the enemy of the Soviet regime, this just happens to coincide with some important [international] events and we postpone the decision.\n| source = [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]], a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] member.}}\n\nSolzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to have his novel ''Cancer Ward'' legally published in the Soviet Union. This required the approval of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Writers]]. Though some there appreciated it, the work was ultimately denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Oak and the Calf| title-link = The Oak and the Calf}}</ref>\n\nAfter Krushchev's removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. Publishing of Solzhenitsyn's work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a [[non-person]], and, by 1965, the [[KGB]] had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of ''The First Circle''. Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most well-known of all his writings, ''The Gulag Archipelago''.  The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an \"officially acclaimed\" writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\nAfter the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965\u201367, the preparatory drafts of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in [[Estonia]]. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended [[Arnold Susi]], a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] Prison cell. After completion, Solzhenitsyn's original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi's daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression Under the Soviets, 1945\u20131991|last1 =Rosenfeld|first1 =Alla| first2=Norton T | last2 = Dodge|year= 2001 | publisher = Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3042-0|pages=55, 134 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r73fmcC5itkC&pg}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title= Invisible Allies| last = Solzhenitsyn| first = Aleksandr I | year = 1995| publisher= Basic Books| isbn = 978-1-887178-42-6 | pages =46\u201364 | chapter = The Estonians|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5yYBZ35HPo4C&dq}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He could not receive the prize personally in [[Stockholm]] at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow.  The Swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish-Soviet relations. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union.\n\n''The Gulag Archipelago'' was composed from 1958 to 1967.  It was a three-volume, seven-part work on the Soviet prison camp system. The book drew from Solzhenitsyn's experiences and the testimony of 256<ref>{{Citation | title = The Gulag Archipelago | chapter = Ekaterinburg: U-Faktoriia}}</ref> former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the Russian penal system.  It discusses the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with [[Vladimir Lenin]] having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, [[Kengir uprising|prisoner uprisings and revolts]], and the practice of internal [[exile]]. According to Gulag historian [[Anne Applebaum]], ''The Gulag Archipelago'''s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made it one of the most influential books of the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation | first = Anne | last = Applebaum | year = 2007 | contribution = Foreword | publisher = Harper | series = Perennial Modern Classics | title = The Gulag Archipelago}}</ref> ''The Gulag Archipelago'' has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages.\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 6624 Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Mstislav Rostropovich.jpg|thumb|Solzhenitsyn (right) and his long-time friend [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] (left) at the celebration of Solzhenitsyn's 80th birthday]]\n\nOn 8 August 1971, the [[KGB]] allegedly attempted to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown chemical agent (most likely [[ricin]]) with an experimental gel-based delivery method.<ref>{{cite book |title = The First Directorate |last = Kalugin |first = Oleg |year = 1994 |publisher = Diane |page = [https://archive.org/details/firstdirectorate00kalu/page/180 180] |isbn = 978-0-312-11426-8 |url = https://archive.org/details/firstdirectorate00kalu/page/180 }}</ref><ref>{{cite techreport | last = Carus | first = Seth | year = 1998 | title= Bioterrorism and Biocrimes | url = https://fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf | publisher = Federation of American Scientists |page=84 | format = PDF}}</ref> The attempt left him seriously ill but he survived.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Toxic Politics: The Secret History of the Kremlin's Poison Laboratory\u2014from the Special Cabinet to the Death of Litvinenko |last=Vaksberg |first=Arkadi\u012d|date=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-38747-0|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|pages=130\u2013131}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| edition = Rev. and updated| publisher = Ignatius Press| isbn = 978-1-58617-496-5| last = Pearce| first = Joseph| title = Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile| location = San Francisco| date = 2011|page=57}}</ref>\n\nAlthough ''The Gulag Archipelago'' was not published in the Soviet Union, it was extensively criticized by the Party-controlled Soviet press.

I replied that I was unable to receive an award from a government that had led Russia into such dire straits.\"<ref name=\"Solzhenitsyn 2007\"/> In a 2003 interview with Joseph Pearce, Solzhenitsyn said: \"We are exiting from communism in a most unfortunate and awkward way.

The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance, while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations, with present-day Moscow [as] a convenient target. They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now, while Moscow has remained communist.

This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of Eastern Europe. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West.\nDelivering the commencement address at [[Harvard University]] in 1978, he called the United States spiritually weak and mired in vulgar [[Economic materialism|materialism]]. Americans, he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, suffered from a \"decline in courage\" and a \"lack of manliness.\" Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He condemned both the United States government and American society for its \"hasty\" capitulation in the [[Vietnam War]]. He criticized the country's music as intolerable and attacked its [[freedom of the press|unfettered press]], accusing it of violations of privacy. He said that the West erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model.  While faulting Soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people, he also faulted the West for being too legalistic: \"A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities.\" Solzhenitsyn also argued that the West erred in \"denying [Russian culture's] autonomous character and therefore never understood it\".<ref name=harvard />\n\nSolzhenitsyn was critical of [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO's eastward expansion]] towards Russia's borders.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> In 2006, Solzhenitsyn accused [[NATO]] of trying to bring Russia under its control; he claimed this was visual because of its \"ideological support for the '[[colour revolutions]]' and the paradoxical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia\".<ref name=\"bbc\">{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4953690.stm | title = Solzhenitsyn warns of Nato plot | newspaper = [[BBC News]] | date = 28 April 2006}}</ref> In a 2006 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' he stated \"This was especially painful in the case of Ukraine, a country whose closeness to Russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples, relatives living on different sides of the national border.

During his speech, Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin's [[Bolshevik]]s with the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin Party]] during the [[French Revolution]]. He also compared the Vendean rebels with the Russian, Ukrainian, and Cossack peasants who rebelled against the Bolsheviks, saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by revolutionary despotism. However, he commented that, while the French [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the [[Thermidorian reaction|toppling of the Jacobins]] and the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the [[Khrushchev thaw]] of the 1950s.<ref>''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings 1947\u20132005'', (2008), [[ISI Books]]. pp. 602\u201305.</ref>\n\nAccording to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and Marxist\u2013Leninism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Russian Nationalism |first= David G | last= Rowley | journal = Journal of Contemporary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages=321\u201337 |jstor= 260964 | doi=10.1177/002200949703200303}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Rebuilding Russia,\" an essay first published in 1990 in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' Solzhenitsyn urged the Soviet Union to grant independence to all the non-Slav [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]], which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] that he considered to be [[Russified]].<ref name= RFLSolUKma>{{Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Solzhenitsyn_Leaves_Troubled_Legacy_Across_Former_Soviet_Union/1188876.html | title = Solzhenitsyn Leaves Troubled Legacy Across Former Soviet Union | newspaper = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | date = 6 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Daniel J. Mahoney, \"if one opens almost any page of Solzhenitsyn's 1994 essay ''\"The Russian Question\" at the End of the Twentieth Century'' one finds Solzhenitsyn attacking the cruelties and injustice of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]], faulting Tsarist authorities for their blindness about the need for political liberty in Russia, and for their wasting of the nation's strength in unnecessary and counterproductive foreign adventures.

However, he commented that, while the French [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the [[Thermidorian reaction|toppling of the Jacobins]] and the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the [[Khrushchev thaw]] of the 1950s.<ref>''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings 1947\u20132005'', (2008), [[ISI Books]]. pp. 602\u201305.</ref>\n\nAccording to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and Marxist\u2013Leninism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Russian Nationalism |first= David G | last= Rowley | journal = Journal of Contemporary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages=321\u201337 |jstor= 260964 | doi=10.1177/002200949703200303}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Rebuilding Russia,\" an essay first published in 1990 in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' Solzhenitsyn urged the Soviet Union to grant independence to all the non-Slav [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]], which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] that he considered to be [[Russified]].<ref name= RFLSolUKma>{{Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Solzhenitsyn_Leaves_Troubled_Legacy_Across_Former_Soviet_Union/1188876.html | title = Solzhenitsyn Leaves Troubled Legacy Across Former Soviet Union | newspaper = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | date = 6 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Daniel J.
