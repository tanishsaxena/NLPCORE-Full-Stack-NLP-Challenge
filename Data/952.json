He was born in the castle of Mont P\u00e8lerin in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] while his father was on the [[First Crusade]]. He was given the name \"Jourdain\" after being baptised in the [[Jordan River]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAlfonso's father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, [[Guillaume Jourdain|William Jordan]], [[Count of Cerdagne]], until he was five. He was then taken to Europe, where his half-brother [[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]] had given him the county of Rouergue. Upon Bertrand's death in 1112, Alfonso succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence. \n\nIn 1114, Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]], who claimed Toulouse by right of his wife Philippa, daughter of Count [[William IV of Toulouse|William IV]], invaded the county and conquered it. Alfonso recovered a part in 1119, but he was not in full control until 1123. When at last successful, he was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Callixtus II]] for having expelled the monks of [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]], who had aided his enemies.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Carte provence 1125.png|thumb|upright|left|Division of Provence obtained by Alfonso Jordan in 1125.

Not until September 1125 did their war end in \"peace and concord\" (''pax et concordia'').<ref>Adam Kosto, ''Making Agreements in Medieval Catalonia: Power, Order, and the Written Word, 1000\u20131200'' (Cambridge, 2001), 256\u201358.</ref> At this stage, Alfonso was master of the regions lying between the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]], the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and the sea. His ascendancy was, according to one commentator, an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \nIn March 1126, Alfonso was at the court of [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]] when he acceded to the throne. \nAccording to the ''[[Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris]]'', Alfonso and [[Suero Verm\u00fadez]] took the city of [[Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] from opposition magnates and handed it over to Alfonso VII.{{sfn|Barton|1997|pp=126\u201328|ps=.

His daughter [[Faidiva of Toulouse|Faydiva]] (died 1154) married Count [[Humbert III of Savoy]]. He left two other daughters: the legitimate Agnes (died 1187) and the illegitimate Laurentia, who married Count [[Bernard III of Comminges]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Barton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "126\u201328"}, {"name": "ps", "value": ".
