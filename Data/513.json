Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been [[Turing-complete]] as later defined by [[Alan Turing]]. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards. Babbage developed some two dozen programs for the Analytical Engine between 1837 and 1840, and one program later.{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}{{sfn|Bromley|1990|p=89}} These programs treat polynomials, iterative formulas, [[Gaussian elimination]], and [[Bernoulli numbers]].{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}{{sfn|Bromley|2000|p=11}}\n\nIn 1842, the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Federico Menabrea]] published a description of the engine based on a lecture by Babbage in French. In 1843, the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by [[Ada Lovelace]], who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier. In recognition of her additions to Menabrea's paper, which included a way to calculate [[Bernoulli number]]s using the machine (widely considered to be the first complete computer program), she has been described as the first [[computer programmer]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Collier"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1970"}, {"name": "p", "value": "chapter 3"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=ocx4Jc12mkgC&pg=PA176"}, {"name": "title", "value": "International Biographical Dictionary of Computer Pioneers"}, {"name": "first", "value": "John A.n"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Lee"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 August 2012"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781884964473"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1995"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/science100scient0000balc"}, {"name": "url-access", "value": "registration"}, {"name": "page", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/science100scient0000balc/page/105 105]"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Science: 100 Scientists Who Changed the World"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Enchanted Lion Books"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Jon"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Balchin"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 August 2012"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781592700172"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2003"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Collier"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1970"}, {"name": "p", "value": "chapter 3"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=gkWunaISTsgC&lpg=PA197&dq=Analytical%20Engine%201833&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q=Analytical%20Engine%201833&f=false"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Mathematical Work of Charles Babbage"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Dubbey"}, {"name": "first", "value": "J.

Instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution, showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided.\n\n[[Allan G. Bromley]] has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions, which would make the engine Turing-complete:\n\n<blockquote>...the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse (and hence to loop)...{{sfn|Bromley|1982|p=215}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The introduction for the first time, in 1845, of user operations for a variety of service functions including, most importantly, an effective system for user control of looping in user programs.\n\nThere is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified. In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbage's sample programs. There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user.{{sfn|Bromley|2000}}</blockquote>\n\nIn their emulator of the engine, [[Fourmilab]] say:\n\n<blockquote>The Engine's Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish. It can, in addition, directed by the very cards it reads and advised by whether the Mill's run-up lever is activated, either advance the card chain forward, skipping the intervening cards, or backward, causing previously-read cards to be processed once again.</blockquote>\n\nThis emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set, though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbage's original works.  For example, a factorial program would be written as:\n\n N0 6\n N1 1\n N2 1\n \u00d7\n L1\n L0\n S1\n \u2013\n L0\n L2\n S0\n L2\n L0\n CB?11\n\nwhere the CB is the conditional branch instruction or \"combination card\" used to make the control flow jump, in this case backwards by 11 cards.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bromley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1982"}, {"name": "p", "value": "215"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bromley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2000"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": " Influence ", "paragraphs": "\n=== Predicted influence ===\n\nBabbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as [[algorithmic efficiency]], writing in his ''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'', \"As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science.

The novel explores the consequences and implications of the early introduction of computational technology.\n* There is also mention of the Analytical Engine (or the Clockwork Ouroboros as it is also known there) in ''[[The Book of the War]]'', a [[Faction Paradox]] anthology edited by [[Lawrence Miles]]. This machine was used to calculate a way into the \"Eleven Day Empire\". Its use resulted in the destruction of the original [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]].\n* In the novel ''[[Perdido Street Station]]'', by British author [[China Mi\u00e9ville]], engines similar to Babbage's serve as \"brains\" for the robotic constructs of the city of New Crobuzon. One such engine even develops sentient thought due to a recursive algorithmic loop.\n* The [[British Empire]] of ''[[The Peshawar Lancers]]'' by [[S. M. Stirling]] features a massive water-powered analytical engine at [[Srinagar|Oxford]], used by two of the main characters. It is noted that most of the engines run on steam, and that an even larger one is under construction at the British Capital in Delhi.\n* In the [[Michael Flynn (author)|Michael Flynn]] novel ''[[In the Country of the Blind]]'', a secret society calling itself the Babbage Society secretly financed the building of Babbage Engines in the mid-19th century. In the novel, the Society uses the Babbage engines along with a statistical science called Cliology to predict and manipulate future history. In the process, they predict the rise of the Nazis and accidentally start the US Civil War.\n* In the [[Neal Stephenson]] novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', ubiquitous molecular nanotechnology is described to make use of \"rod logic\" similar to that imagined by Babbage's design for the Analytical Engine.\n* ''Moriarty by Modem'', a short story by Jack Nimersheim, describes an alternate history where Babbage's Analytical Engine was indeed completed and had been deemed highly classified by the British government. The characters of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] had in reality been a set of prototype programs written for the Analytical Engine. This short story follows Holmes as his program is implemented on modern computers and he is forced to compete against his nemesis yet again in the modern counterparts of Babbage's Analytical Engine.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Nimersheim |title=Moriarty by Modem |url=http://www.cheznims.com/moriarty.htm |publisher=cheznims.com |year=1995 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A similar setting is used by [[Sydney Padua]] in the webcomic ''[[The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2dgoggles.com/ |title=Dangerous experiments in comics |publisher=2D Goggles |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=58111 |title=Experiments in Comics with Sydney Padua |publisher=Tor.com |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> It features an [[alternate history]] where Ada Lovelace and Babbage have built the Analytical Engine and use it to fight crime at [[Queen Victoria]]'s request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/category/the-client/ |title=The Client &#124; 2D Goggles |publisher=Sydneypadua.com |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> The comic is based on thorough research on the biographies of and correspondence between Babbage and Lovelace, which is then twisted for humorous effect.\n* ''[[Georgia on My Mind (novelette)|Georgia on My Mind]]'' is a [[Novella|novelette]] by [[Charles Sheffield]] which involves two major themes: being widowed and the quest for a legendary Babbage computer.\n* [[Hugh Cook (science fiction author)|Hugh Cook]]'s fantasy novels ''[[The Wishstone and the Wonderworkers]]'' and ''[[The Wazir and the Witch]]'' feature an Analytical Engine created by the scientist Ivan Petrov. It is used to calculate income tax.\n* The [[Orion's Arm]] online project features the ''Machina Babbagenseii'', fully sentient Babbage inspired mechanical computers. Each is the size of a large asteroid, only capable surviving in microgravity conditions, and processes data at 0.5% the speed of a human brain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Machina Babbagenseii |url=http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47f1ab093f416 |publisher=[[Orion's Arm]] |year=2014 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n* The flying ships in the anime ''[[Last Exile]]'' are seen to have analytical engines inside of them. Although some have more advanced technology, the common ships use analytical engines, and even some of the advanced ships are seen to have clockwork mechanisms as well.\n* A working version of the Analytical Engine, created by fictional inventor Ernest Harding (and based on the Babbage concept) was featured on the ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'' (also called The Artful Detective), in Season 5, Episode 9, ''Invention Convention''.<ref>{{IMDb episode |2203157 |Invention Convention}}</ref>\n* In the 12 season episode of Doctor Who \"Spyfall Part 2\", the Analytical machine is shown along with Babbage and Ada Lovelace.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "fiction trivia", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "August 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Jack"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Nimersheim"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Moriarty by Modem"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.cheznims.com/moriarty.htm"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "cheznims.com"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "7 May 2016"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://2dgoggles.com/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Dangerous experiments in comics"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "2D Goggles"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 August 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=58111"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Experiments in Comics with Sydney Padua"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Tor.com"}, {"name": "date", "value": "26 October 2009"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 August 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/category/the-client/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Client &#124; 2D Goggles"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Sydneypadua.com"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 August 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Machina Babbagenseii"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47f1ab093f416"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Orion's Arm]]"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2014"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "7 May 2016"}]}, {"name": "IMDb episode ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2203157"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Invention Convention"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": " References ", "paragraphs": "\n{{reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": "{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Babbage |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Babbage |title=Passages from the Life of a Philosopher |chapter=Chapter VIII \u2013 Of the Analytical Engine |year=1864 |chapter-url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/lpae.html |location=London |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green |pages= 112\u2013141 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Babbage |first=Charles |editor-last=Babbage |editor-first=Henry P. |url=http://monoskop.org/images/4/40/Babbage_Charles_Calculating_Engines.pdf |title=Babbage's Calculating Engines \u2013 Being a Collection of Papers Relating to Them; Their History, and Construction |year=1889 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-00096-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Allan G. |authorlink=Allan G.
