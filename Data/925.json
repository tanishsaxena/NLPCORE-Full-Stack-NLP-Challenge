The son of a [[pottery|potter]] who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army along with his brother [[Antander]]. In 333 BC he married the [[widow]] of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. He was twice [[Exile|banished]] for attempting to overthrow the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] party in Syracuse.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 317 BC he returned with an army of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] under a solemn oath to observe the [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitution]] which was established after they took the city. Having massacred the oligarchs and the richest of the citizenry, he thus made himself master of Syracuse, and he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of Sicily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nWar with [[Carthage]] followed. In 311 BC Agathocles was defeated in the [[Battle of the Himera River (311 BC)|Battle of the Himera River]] and [[siege|besieged]] in Syracuse. In 310 BC he made a desperate effort to break through the [[blockade]] and attack the enemy in [[Africa]].\n\nIn 309/8 BC, Agathocles turned his attention towards [[Ophellas]], ruler of [[Cyrenaica]] as likely to prove a useful ally in his war against the Carthaginians. In order to gain him over he promised to cede to him whatever conquests their combined forces might make in Africa, reserving to himself only the possession of Sicily.<ref>Diodorus xx. 40.1-4</ref> Ophellas gathered a powerful army from the homeland of his wife Euthydike (a descendant of [[Miltiades]]), [[Athens]], where many citizens felt disgruntled after having lost their voting rights.{{sfn|Habicht|1998|p=95}} Notwithstanding all the natural obstacles which presented themselves on his route, Ophellas succeeded in reaching the Carthaginian territories after a toilsome and perilous march of more than two months' duration.<ref>Diodorus xx. 41-42</ref> He was received by Agathocles with every demonstration of friendship, and the two armies encamped near each other: but not many days had elapsed when Agathocles betrayed his new ally, attacked the camp of the Cyrenaeans, and had Ophellas himself killed.<ref>Diodorus xx. 42.4-5; 43.3-4</ref> The Cyrenean troops, left without a leader, went over to Agathocles.{{sfn|Habicht|1998|p=95}}\n\nFollowing several victories he was at last completely defeated (307 BC) and fled secretly to Sicily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After concluding peace with Carthage in 306 BC, Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in 304 BC, and established his rule over the [[Greece|Greek]] cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the [[Halycus|Halycus River]]. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.\n\nHis last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson [[Archagathus (grandson of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]], at whose instigation he is said to have been [[poison]]ed; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular \"tyrant\". Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.\n\nAgathocles was married three times. His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas by whom he had two sons: [[Archagathus (son of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]] and his brother, who were both murdered in 307 BC. His second wife was Alcia and they had a daughter called [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], who married as the second wife of King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], and a son, Agathocles, who was murdered in a succession dispute shortly before his father's death. His third wife was the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greek Ptolemaic Princess]] [[Theoxena of Syracuse|Theoxena]], who was the second daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice I]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]] and was a stepdaughter of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. Theoxena bore Agathocles two children: [[Archagathus of Libya|Archagathus]] and [[Theoxena of Egypt|Theoxena]]. Theoxena survived Agathocles. He had further descendants from his second and third marriage.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Habicht"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "p", "value": "95"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Habicht"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "p", "value": "95"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Legacy", "paragraphs": "Agathocles was cited as an example \"Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes\" in Chapter VIII of [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s treatise on politics -  ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513). \nHe was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career.
