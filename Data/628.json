Khentiamentiu's name became an [[epithet]] of Osiris. King [[Mentuhotep II]] was the first to build a [[Mahat chapel of Nebhetepre Mentuhotep II|royal chapel]].

There were significant names deliberately left off of the list.

These included three chapels for the \"state\" deities Ptah, Re-Horakhty, and (centrally positioned) Amun-Re and the challenge for the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form known of the Daily Ritual, which was performed daily in temples across Egypt throughout the pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the [[Osireion]], which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of [[Osiris]] as an \"Osiris tomb\".<ref>Caulfield, ''Temple of the Kings''</ref>  It is possible that from those chambers was led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah.<ref>Murray, ''The Osireion at Abydos''</ref> The temple was originally {{convert|550|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about\n{{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, including the wing at the side.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}  Magazines for food and offerings storage were built to either side of the forecourts, as well as a small palace for the king and his retinue, to the southeast of the first forecourt (Ghazouli, The Palace and Magazines Attached to the Temple of Sety I at Abydos and the Facade of This Temple.

The temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement, utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late 18th Dynasty reliefs.

Others tombs also built before Menes are {{convert|15|x|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The probable tomb of [[Menes]] is of the latter size.\n\nAfterward, the tombs increased in size and complexity. The tomb-pit was surrounded by chambers to hold offerings, the [[sepulchre]] being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh, surrounded the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} Some of the offerings included sacrificed animals, such as the [[Asinus|asses]] found in the tomb of [[Merneith]]. Evidence of [[human sacrifice]] exists in the early tombs, such as the 118 servants in the tomb of Merneith, but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later.\n\nBy the end of the Second Dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over {{convert|3000|m2|acre|abbr=off}}, however it is possible for this to have been several tombs which abutted one another during construction; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns.

A large number of fine tombs were made in the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] to [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth]] Dynasties, and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]].

Others tombs also built before Menes are {{convert|15|x|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The probable tomb of [[Menes]] is of the latter size.\n\nAfterward, the tombs increased in size and complexity. The tomb-pit was surrounded by chambers to hold offerings, the [[sepulchre]] being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh, surrounded the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} Some of the offerings included sacrificed animals, such as the [[Asinus|asses]] found in the tomb of [[Merneith]]. Evidence of [[human sacrifice]] exists in the early tombs, such as the 118 servants in the tomb of Merneith, but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later.\n\nBy the end of the Second Dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over {{convert|3000|m2|acre|abbr=off}}, however it is possible for this to have been several tombs which abutted one another during construction; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.<ref>Petrie, ''Royal Tombs'', i. and ii.</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\nA cemetery for private persons was put into use during the First Dynasty, with some [[pit-tomb]]s in the town. It was extensive in the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth]] and [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth]] Dynasties and contained many rich tombs. A large number of fine tombs were made in the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] to [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth]] Dynasties, and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]]. Many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by [[Auguste Mariette]]'s workmen, without any details of the burials being noted.<ref>Mariette, ''Abydos'', ii. and iii.</ref> Later excavations have been recorded by [[Edward R.
