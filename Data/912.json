He was a Professor at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]]. Kolbe coined the term [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] and contributed to the philosophical demise of [[vitalism]] through synthesis of the [[organic chemical|organic substance]] acetic acid from [[carbon disulfide]], and also contributed to the development of [[structural theory]]. This was done via modifications to the idea of \"radicals\" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his [[Kolbe electrolysis]] of carboxylate salts, the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] in the preparation of [[aspirin]] and the [[Kolbe nitrile synthesis]]. After studies with [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler|W\u00f6hler]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]], Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London (with [[Edward Frankland|Frankland]]), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the [[:de:Journal f\u00fcr praktische Chemie|''Journal f\u00fcr Praktische Chemie'']]. As such, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  won the [[Royal Society of London]]'s Davy Medal in the year of his death. Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists (including [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev|Zaitsev]], [[Theodor Curtius|Curtius]], [[Ernst Otto Beckmann|Beckmann]], [[Carl Graebe|Graebe]], [[Vladimir Markovnikov|Markovnikov]], etc.), Kolbe is remembered for editing the ''Journal'' for more than a decade, where his rejection of [[August Kekul\u00e9|Kekul\u00e9]]'s structure of benzene, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van't Hoff]]'s theory on the origin of [[chirality]] and [[Adolf von Baeyer|von Baeyer]]'s reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. Kolbe died of a heart attack in [[Leipzig]] at age 68, six years after the death of his wife, Charlotte. He was survived by four children.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox scientist \n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Hermann Kolbe"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Hermann Kolbe2.jpg"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Hermann Kolbe"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{Birth date|1818|9|27|df=y}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "Elliehausen, near [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]]"}, {"name": "residence", "value": "Germany, England"}, {"name": "nationality", "value": "German"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|1884|11|25|1818|9|27|df=y}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Leipzig]], [[German Empire]]"}, {"name": "field", "value": "[[Chemist]]"}, {"name": "work_institutions", "value": "[[University of Marburg]]<br/>[[University of Leipzig]]"}, {"name": "alma_mater", "value": "[[University of Marburg]]"}, {"name": "doctoral_advisor", "value": "[[Robert Bunsen]]<br/> [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]]"}, {"name": "doctoral_students", "value": "[[Peter Griess]]<br/> [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev]]<br/> [[Theodor Curtius]]<br/> [[Ernst Otto Beckmann]]<br/> [[Carl Graebe]]<br/> [[Oscar Loew]]<br/> [[Constantin Fahlberg]]<br/> [[Nikolai Menshutkin]]<br/> [[Vladimir Markovnikov]]<br/> [[Jacob Volhard]]<br/> [[Ludwig Mond]]<br/> [[Alexander Crum Brown]]<br/> [[Maxwell Simpson]]<br/> [[Frederick Guthrie]] [Note, not primary advisor for all in this list]"}, {"name": "known_for", "value": "[[Kolbe electrolysis]],<br/> [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]]<br/> [[Kolbe nitrile synthesis]]"}, {"name": "prizes", "value": "[[Davy Medal]] {{small|(1884)}}"}]}, {"name": "Birth date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1818"}, {"name": "2", "value": "9"}, {"name": "3", "value": "27"}, {"name": "df", "value": "y"}]}, {"name": "death date and age", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1884"}, {"name": "2", "value": "11"}, {"name": "3", "value": "25"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1818"}, {"name": "5", "value": "9"}, {"name": "6", "value": "27"}, {"name": "df", "value": "y"}]}, {"name": "small", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "(1884)"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Life", "paragraphs": "\nKolbe was born in Elliehausen, near [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (Germany) as the eldest son of a [[Protestant]] pastor.

He took his doctoral degree in 1843 at the same university.  A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] at the new ''Museum of Economic Geology'' in London and  a close friend of [[Edward Frankland]].

Kolbe promoted the idea that [[organic compound]]s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this \"organic\" context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. (Hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one [[organic compound|organic molecule]] to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting \"inorganic\"\u2014''anorganisch''\u2014substances into \"organic\" ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) He validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]] to [[acetic acid]] in several steps (1843\u201345). Kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural [[radical theory|radicals]], so contributing to the development of [[structural theory]]. A dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. Kolbe was the first person to use the word [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] in its present-day meaning,<ref>Kolbe coined the word \"synthesis\" during his attempt to transform carbon disulfide into acetic acid.
