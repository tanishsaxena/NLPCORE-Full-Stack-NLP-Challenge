During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]] of Moab in attacking Israel.\n\nThe Ammonites maintained their claim to part of [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]], after it was occupied by the Israelites who obtained it from [[Sihon]]. During the days of [[Jephthah]], the Ammonites occupied the lands east of the River Jordan and started to invade Israelite lands west of the river. Jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions.\n\nThe constant harassment of the Israelite communities east of the Jordan by the Ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul]]. King [[Nahash of Ammon]] ({{circa|1010}}{{snd}}990 BC) lay siege to [[Jabesh-Gilead]]. Eventually this led to an alliance with Saul and The Israelites, led by Saul relieved the siege and defeated the Ammonite king, eventually resulting in the formation of the Israelite Kingdom.\n\nDuring the reign of [[King David]], the Ammonites humiliated David's messengers, and hired the Aramean armies to attack Israel. This eventually ended in a war and a year-long siege of [[Rabbah]], the capital of Ammon.

Their hostility to Judah is shown in their joining the Chaldeans to destroy it ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:2|NIV}}). Their cruelty is denounced by the prophet Amos\n({{bibleverse||Amos|1:13|NIV}}), and their destruction (with their return in the future) by Jeremiah ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|49:1-6|NIV}}); Ezekiel ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|21:28-32|NIV}}); and Zephaniah ({{bibleverse||Zephaniah|2:8-11|NIV}}). Their murder of Gedaliah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:22-26|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:14|NIV}}) was a dastardly act.

They also joined the Syrians in their wars with the Maccabees and were defeated by Judas.<ref name=\"C\" />\n\n===Rabbanic Literature===\nThe Ammonites, still numerous in the south of Palestine in the second Christian century according to [[Justin Martyr]] (\"Dialogus cum Tryphone,\" ch. cxix.), presented a serious problem to the Pharisaic scribes because of the fact that many marriages with Ammonite and Moabite wives had taken place in the days of [[Nehemiah]] (Neh. xiii. 23). Still later, it is not improbable that when [[Judas Maccabeus]] had inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Ammonites, Jewish warriors took Ammonite women as wives, and their sons, sword in hand, claimed recognition as Jews notwithstanding the law (Deut. xxiii. 4) that \"an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.\" Such a condition or a similar incident is reflected in the story told in the Talmud (Yeb. 76b, 77a; Ruth R. to ii. 5) that in the days of King [[Saul]], the legitimacy of David's claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], the Moabite; whereupon Ithra, the Israelite (II Sam. xvii. 25; compare I Chron. ii. 17), girt with his sword, strode like an Ishmaelite into the schoolhouse of Jesse, declaring upon the authority of [[Samuel]], the prophet, and his bet din (court of justice), that the law excluding the Ammonite and Moabite from the Jewish congregation referred only to the men\u2014who alone had sinned in not meeting Israel with bread and water\u2014and not to the women. The story reflects actual conditions in pre-Talmudic times, conditions that led to the fixed rule stated in the Mishnah (Yeb. viii. 3): \"Ammonite and Moabite men are excluded from the Jewish community for all time; their women are admissible.\"\n\nThe fact that [[Rehoboam]], the son of King [[Solomon]], was born of an Ammonite woman (I Kings, xiv. 21-31) also made it difficult to maintain the Messianic claims of the [[Davidic line|house of David]]; but it was adduced as an illustration of divine Providence which selected the \"two doves,\" Ruth, the Moabite, and [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], the Ammonitess, for honorable distinction (B. \u1e32. 38b).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1414-ammon-ammonites Jewish encyclopedia Ammonites]</ref> Ruth's kindness as noted in the Book of Ruth by Boaz is seen in the Jewish Tradition as in rare contradistinction to the peoples of Moab (where Ruth comes from) and Amon in general, who were noted by the Torah for their distinct ''lack'' of kindness. Deut. 23:5: \"Because they [the peoples of Amon and Moab] did not greet you with bread and water on the way when you left Egypt, and because he [the people of Moab] hired Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim against you, to curse you.\" Rashi notes regarding Israel's travels on the way: \"when you were in [a state of] extreme exhaustion.\"\n\nBaalis, king of the Ammonites, envious of the Jewish colony's prosperity, or jealous of the might of the Babylonian king, instigated [[Ishmael son of Nethaniah|Ishmael, son of Nathaniel]], \"of the royal seed,\" to make an end of the Judean rule in Palestine, Ishmael, being an unscrupulous character, permitted himself to become the tool of the Ammonite king in order to realize his own ambition to become the ruler of the deserted land. Information of this conspiracy reached [[Gedaliah]] through Johanan, son of Kareah, and Johanan undertook to slay Ishmael before he had had time to carry out his evil design; but the governor disbelieved the report, and forbade Johanan to lay hands upon the conspirator. Ishmael and his ten companions were royally entertained at Gedaliah's table. In the midst of the festivities Ishmael slew the unsuspecting Gedaliah, the Chaldean garrison stationed in Mizpah, and all the Jews that were with him, casting their bodies into the pit of Asa (Josephus, \"Ant.\" x. 9, \u00a7 4). The Rabbis condemn the overconfidence of Gedaliah, holding him responsible for the death of his followers (Niddah 61a; comp. Jer. xli. 9). Ishmael captured many of the inhabitants of Mizpah, as well as \"the daughters of the king\" entrusted to Gedaliah's care by the Babylonian general, and fled to Ammon. Johanan and his followers, however, on receiving the sad tidings, immediately pursued the murderers, overtaking them at the lake of Gibeon. The captives were rescued, but Ishmael and eight of his men escaped to the land of Ammon.

Still later, it is not improbable that when [[Judas Maccabeus]] had inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Ammonites, Jewish warriors took Ammonite women as wives, and their sons, sword in hand, claimed recognition as Jews notwithstanding the law (Deut. xxiii. 4) that \"an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.\" Such a condition or a similar incident is reflected in the story told in the Talmud (Yeb. 76b, 77a; Ruth R. to ii. 5) that in the days of King [[Saul]], the legitimacy of David's claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], the Moabite; whereupon Ithra, the Israelite (II Sam. xvii. 25; compare I Chron. ii. 17), girt with his sword, strode like an Ishmaelite into the schoolhouse of Jesse, declaring upon the authority of [[Samuel]], the prophet, and his bet din (court of justice), that the law excluding the Ammonite and Moabite from the Jewish congregation referred only to the men\u2014who alone had sinned in not meeting Israel with bread and water\u2014and not to the women. The story reflects actual conditions in pre-Talmudic times, conditions that led to the fixed rule stated in the Mishnah (Yeb. viii. 3): \"Ammonite and Moabite men are excluded from the Jewish community for all time; their women are admissible.\"\n\nThe fact that [[Rehoboam]], the son of King [[Solomon]], was born of an Ammonite woman (I Kings, xiv. 21-31) also made it difficult to maintain the Messianic claims of the [[Davidic line|house of David]]; but it was adduced as an illustration of divine Providence which selected the \"two doves,\" Ruth, the Moabite, and [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], the Ammonitess, for honorable distinction (B. \u1e32. 38b).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1414-ammon-ammonites Jewish encyclopedia Ammonites]</ref> Ruth's kindness as noted in the Book of Ruth by Boaz is seen in the Jewish Tradition as in rare contradistinction to the peoples of Moab (where Ruth comes from) and Amon in general, who were noted by the Torah for their distinct ''lack'' of kindness. Deut. 23:5: \"Because they [the peoples of Amon and Moab] did not greet you with bread and water on the way when you left Egypt, and because he [the people of Moab] hired Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim against you, to curse you.\" Rashi notes regarding Israel's travels on the way: \"when you were in [a state of] extreme exhaustion.\"\n\nBaalis, king of the Ammonites, envious of the Jewish colony's prosperity, or jealous of the might of the Babylonian king, instigated [[Ishmael son of Nethaniah|Ishmael, son of Nathaniel]], \"of the royal seed,\" to make an end of the Judean rule in Palestine, Ishmael, being an unscrupulous character, permitted himself to become the tool of the Ammonite king in order to realize his own ambition to become the ruler of the deserted land. Information of this conspiracy reached [[Gedaliah]] through Johanan, son of Kareah, and Johanan undertook to slay Ishmael before he had had time to carry out his evil design; but the governor disbelieved the report, and forbade Johanan to lay hands upon the conspirator. Ishmael and his ten companions were royally entertained at Gedaliah's table. In the midst of the festivities Ishmael slew the unsuspecting Gedaliah, the Chaldean garrison stationed in Mizpah, and all the Jews that were with him, casting their bodies into the pit of Asa (Josephus, \"Ant.\" x. 9, \u00a7 4). The Rabbis condemn the overconfidence of Gedaliah, holding him responsible for the death of his followers (Niddah 61a; comp. Jer. xli. 9). Ishmael captured many of the inhabitants of Mizpah, as well as \"the daughters of the king\" entrusted to Gedaliah's care by the Babylonian general, and fled to Ammon. Johanan and his followers, however, on receiving the sad tidings, immediately pursued the murderers, overtaking them at the lake of Gibeon. The captives were rescued, but Ishmael and eight of his men escaped to the land of Ammon. The plan of Baalis thus succeeded, for the Jewish refugees, fearing lest the Babylonian king should hold them responsible for the murder, never returned to their native land.
