The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.\n\n[[File:The Powis gate Old Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 421948.jpg|thumb|upright|The Powis gate, Old Aberdeen, built in 1834]]\nDuring the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides.

The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.<ref name=\"fraser\"/> The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1891.

This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian \"Old Red\" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the [[Dalradian]] period (approximately 480\u2013600&nbsp;million years ago) with sporadic areas of [[igneous rock|igneous]] [[Diorite]] granites to be found, such as that at the [[Rubislaw quarry]] which was used to build much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |title=Details of Aberdeen City |author=Gazetter for Scotland |accessdate=10 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035411/http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee]] and the [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|Don]], which turns into high [[sand dunes]] north of the Don stretching as far as [[Fraserburgh]]; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets.

These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the [[oil industry]], which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy. Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the [[Paper mills of Aberdeen|Stoneywood Paper Mill]] with a workforce of approximately 500.

The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rain water from the quarry with the aim of developing a heritage centre on the site.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|title=Water pumping work starts at Rubislaw Quarry in Aberdeen|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=2012-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713191152/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:NDBQ 26 - 10th Jan 2015.JPG|thumb|Neptune Energy and Aker Solutions Buildings, North Dee Business Quarter.

The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to [[Peterhead]]. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen Harbour from Air.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Aberdeen Harbour from the Air]]\n\nGeologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, {{convert|110|mi}} east of Aberdeen.\n\nBy late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.\n\nThe industry supports about 47,000 jobs locally, and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century. As a major port in the UK, Aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port. Seafarers' welfare organisation, [[Apostleship of the Sea]] has a port chaplain in Aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them.\n\n===Business===\nIn 2011, the Centre for Cities named Aberdeen as the best placed city for growth in Britain, as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|title=Aberdeen 'best-placed city for growth' in Britain|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127074124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|archive-date=27 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> With energy still providing the backbone of the local economy, recent years have seen very large new investment in the North Sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|title=Record rise in North Sea oil and gas investment expected|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=3 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010084615/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|archive-date=10 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> This has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang=en|title=Construction gets underway for new GDF Suez E&P UK Aberdeen premises|publisher=GDF Suez E&P|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830085637/http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang%3Den|archive-date=30 August 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAberdeen City and Shire's Gross Domestic Product is estimated at over \u00a311.4 billion, accounting for over 17% of the overall Scottish GDP.

first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to [[Peterhead]]. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen Harbour from Air.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Aberdeen Harbour from the Air]]\n\nGeologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, {{convert|110|mi}} east of Aberdeen.\n\nBy late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.\n\nThe industry supports about 47,000 jobs locally, and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century. As a major port in the UK, Aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port. Seafarers' welfare organisation, [[Apostleship of the Sea]] has a port chaplain in Aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "110"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "Business", "paragraphs": "In 2011, the Centre for Cities named Aberdeen as the best placed city for growth in Britain, as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|title=Aberdeen 'best-placed city for growth' in Britain|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127074124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|archive-date=27 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> With energy still providing the backbone of the local economy, recent years have seen very large new investment in the North Sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|title=Record rise in North Sea oil and gas investment expected|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=3 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010084615/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|archive-date=10 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> This has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang=en|title=Construction gets underway for new GDF Suez E&P UK Aberdeen premises|publisher=GDF Suez E&P|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830085637/http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang%3Den|archive-date=30 August 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAberdeen City and Shire's Gross Domestic Product is estimated at over \u00a311.4 billion, accounting for over 17% of the overall Scottish GDP.

The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where [[sandstone]] has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry. The buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years. There has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their fa\u00e7ade being restored back to much how they looked originally.\n\nAmongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]], are the Town and County Bank, [[The Music Hall (Aberdeen)|the Music Hall]], the [[Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen|Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades]] (originating between 1398 and 1527, although completely rebuilt in the 1860s), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the [[National Bank of Scotland]].

The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to [[Edinburgh]], Dundee, [[Brechin]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the south and [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire|Ellon]], [[Peterhead]] and [[Fraserburgh]] in the north. The A96 links [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Inverness]] and the north west. The A93 is the main route to the west, heading towards Royal Deeside and the [[Cairngorms]]. After [[Braemar]], it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west, through [[Westhill, Aberdeenshire|Westhill]] and on to [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]]. The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, and is now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Arbroath]] and on the east coast. The A947 exits the city at [[Dyce]] and goes on to [[Newmachar]], [[Oldmeldrum]] and [[Turriff]] finally ending at [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]].\n\n[[File:River Dee Railway Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 1445234.jpg|thumb|left|River Dee Railway Bridge]]\n\nAfter first being mooted some 60 years ago and being held up for the past five years by a number of legal challenges, Aberdeen's long-awaited [[Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route|Western Peripheral Route]] was given the go-ahead after campaigners lost their appeal to the UK Supreme Court in October 2012.

Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became [[Robert Gordon University]]. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It was previously ''The Sunday Times'' Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: \"With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year\".<ref>''The Sunday Times'', 12 September 2010 (subscription only).</ref>\n\n[[File:RGU Riverside East building 1.jpg|thumb|Sir Ian Wood building, Robert Gordon University]]\n\nRGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at [[Garthdee]] and currently has approximately 15,500 students.

The [[Scottish Agricultural College]] is based just outside Aberdeen, on the Craibstone Estate. This is situated beside the roundabout for Aberdeen Airport on the A96. The college provides three services\u2014Learning, Research and Consultancy. The college features many land based courses such as Agriculture, Countryside Management, Sustainable Environmental Management and Rural Business Management. There are a variety of courses from diplomas through to master's degrees. The [[Marine Laboratory Aberdeen]], which specialises in fisheries, [[Macaulay Land Use Research Institute]] (soil science), and the [[Rowett Research Institute]] (animal nutrition) are some other higher education institutions.<ref name=EB/>\n\nThe Aberdeen College of Performing Arts also provides full-time Drama and Musical Theatre training at Further Education level.\n\n===Schools===\n[[File:Aberdeen Grammar School - geograph.org.uk - 118948.jpg|thumb|Aberdeen Grammar School]]\n[[File:SchoolBuilding.JPG|thumb|left|Woodside School, dating from 1890]]\n\nThere are currently 12 secondary schools and 54 primary schools which are run by the city council.

Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became [[Robert Gordon University]]. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It was previously ''The Sunday Times'' Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: \"With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year\".<ref>''The Sunday Times'', 12 September 2010 (subscription only).</ref>\n\n[[File:RGU Riverside East building 1.jpg|thumb|Sir Ian Wood building, Robert Gordon University]]\n\nRGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at [[Garthdee]] and currently has approximately 15,500 students.

Both are now part of [[Robert Gordon University]] and are based at its Garthdee campus. [[North East Scotland College]] has several campuses in the city and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications in science.

The college provides three services\u2014Learning, Research and Consultancy. The college features many land based courses such as Agriculture, Countryside Management, Sustainable Environmental Management and Rural Business Management.
