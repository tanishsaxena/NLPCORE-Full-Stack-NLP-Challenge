In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also heavily used for [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]] and [[special effect]]s. Animation is also prevalent in information technology interfaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance the moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Method of creating moving pictures"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "multiple image\n", "values": [{"name": "align", "value": "right"}, {"name": "direction", "value": "vertical"}, {"name": "width", "value": "150"}, {"name": "image1", "value": "Animexample3edit.png"}, {"name": "width1", "value": "150"}, {"name": "caption1", "value": "The [[bouncing ball]] animation (below) consists of these six frames."}, {"name": "image2", "value": "Animexample.gif"}, {"name": "width2", "value": "85"}, {"name": "caption2", "value": "This animation moves at 10 frames per second."}, {"name": "footer_align", "value": "center"}, {"name": "height1", "value": "160"}, {"name": "height2", "value": "80"}, {"name": "alt1", "value": "Weare"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Pervasive Animation"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Suzanne"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Buchan"}, {"name": "date", "value": "22 August 2013"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Routledge"}]}, {"name": "TOC limit", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Etymology", "paragraphs": "The word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The definition of animation on dictionary.com"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": " History ", "paragraphs": "{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view their creations in motion before 1833. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much succes with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns, usually with images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with stop-motion animation, possibly since around 1899. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge success that baffled audiences with objects apparently moving by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]]. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963). Apart from their success in theaters, such characters would also prove very lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise.\n\n===Animated features===\nIn 1937, Disney released their first animated feature film \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\". It was a tremendous success worldwide. The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until competition arose in 1986 with Sullivan-Bluth Studios' 'An American Tail' and furthermore with Pixar in 1995.\n\n===Early animated series on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television. In the United States and many other countries, cartoons were [[Saturday-morning cartoon|programmed on Saturday-mornings]] and other time slots that were convenient for children.\n\nThe back catalog of animated cartoons, originally produced for a short theatrical run, now proved very valuable for television broadcast and many classical series thus found a new life, with many reruns.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, production of animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. The constraints of American television programming resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods.\n\n[[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific on television with programs such as ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'' (1957-1960),''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' (1958, the first half-hour television program to feature only animation),{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=234\u201335}} ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' (1959-1961), ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'' (1961-1962), ''[[The Jetsons]]'' (1962) and ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]''.\n\nOther early televised hit series were Terrytoons' ''[[Tom Terrific]]'' (1958) and ''[[Deputy Dawg]]'' (1962).\n\n===Since 1960s===\n\nJapanese [[anime]] productions became very popular since the 1970s. Relatively cheap licensing ensured wide international distribution.\n\n[[Computer animation]] has become popular since ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=432}}\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the mid-2010s because well-made animated projects can find audiences across borders and in all [[Four-quadrant movie|four quadrants]]. Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s in 2004\u20132013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}}\n\nTraditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films since the 1990s, as box office statistics deemed cheaper and more profitable. However 3d animation is not without its limitations; the unique attractions of 2d art like [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s cannot be rendered properly. Studio sought to evolve the medium and overcome some of the technical limitations that traditional animation had, focusing on organic and volumetric lighting and texturing to give their films a unique look, while maintaining a hand-crafted feel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html

The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by a computer, manually ...).\n\nAnimators can be divided into animators of '''characters''' (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of '''special effects''' (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Animator"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": " Techniques ", "paragraphs": "\n=== Traditional animation ===\n\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957\u20131967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974\u20132005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977\u20132000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984).

O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).\n** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named \"Vermithrax\" from ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91\u201395}}\n* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51\u201357}}\n** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.\n** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357\u201363}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}\n* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[academy award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{Main|Computer animation}}\n'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}\n\n==== 2D animation ====\n{{main|2D computer graphics}}\n[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]\n\n[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71\u201372}} and interpolated rotoscoping.\n\n2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}\n\nFinal line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246\u201347}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127\u201328}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that \"Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.\"{{sfn|Beck|2012}}\n\n==== 3D animation ====\n{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}\n3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78\u201380}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}\n\nOther techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}\n\n===== 3D terms =====\n* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}</ref> Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors.

The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006).

The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22\u201323}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.\n* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}\n* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since Christiaan Huygens invented this early image projector in 1659.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pilling"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "p", "value": "249"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "O'Keefe"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2014"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Parent"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "22\u201323"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kenyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}]}], "id": 26}, {"title": " Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches ", "paragraphs": "[[File:World of Color overview.jpg|thumb|''[[World of Color]]'' hydrotechnics at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using 1200 fountains with high-definition projections on mist screens.]]\n* '''Hydrotechnics''': a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.\n* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].\n* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, [[William Kentridge]] is famous for his [[charcoal]] erasure films,{{sfn|Carbone|2010}} and [[Piotr Duma\u0142a]] for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.\n* '''[[Pinscreen animation]]''': makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen.{{sfn|Neupert|2011}} The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=204}}\n* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=7}} This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the [[light]] [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=30\u201333}}\n* '''[[Flip book]]''': a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22\u201324}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=8\u201310}} Flip books are often illustrated books for children,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=xiv}} they also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22\u201324}} Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.{{sfn|White|2006|p=203}}\n* '''[[Character animation]]'''\n* '''[[Multi-sketch]]ing'''\n* '''[[Special effects animation]]'''\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Faber"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Walters"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "p", "value": "1979"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pilling"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "p", "value": "222"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Carbone"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Neupert"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pilling"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "p", "value": "204"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Brown"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2003"}, {"name": "p", "value": "7"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Furniss"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "30\u201333"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Laybourne"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "22\u201324"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Solomon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1989"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "8\u201310"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Laybourne"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "p", "value": "xiv"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Laybourne"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "22\u201324"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "White"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "203"}]}], "id": 27}, {"title": " See also ", "paragraphs": "{{Portal|size=tiny|Animation}}\n{{Wikipedia books|1=Animation}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[12 basic principles of animation]]\n* [[War film#Animated|Animated war film]]\n* [[Animation department]]\n* [[Animation software]]\n* [[Anime]]\n* [[Architectural animation]]\n* [[Avar (animation variable)]]\n* [[Computer-generated imagery]]\n* [[Independent animation]]\n* [[International Animated Film Association]]\n* [[International Tourn\u00e9e of Animation]]\n* [[List of film-related topics|List of motion picture topics]]\n* [[Model sheet]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[Society for Animation Studies]]\n* [[Tradigital art]]\n* [[Wire-frame model]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Portal", "values": [{"name": "size", "value": "tiny"}, {"name": "1", "value": "Animation"}]}, {"name": "Wikipedia books", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Animation"}]}, {"name": "Div col", "values": [{"name": "colwidth", "value": "20em"}]}], "id": 28}, {"title": " References ", "paragraphs": "=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|22em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Harryhausen_Dalton18\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|page=18}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Harryhausen_Dalton222\u2013226\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=222\u201326}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n;
