The city had long been ruled by kings born to the Penthilid clan but, during the poet's life, the Penthilids were a spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power. Alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success. Their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession:\n* Melanchrus \u2013 he was overthrown sometime between 612&nbsp;BC and 609&nbsp;BC by a faction that, in addition to the brothers of Alcaeus, included [[Pittacus]] (later renowned as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]); Alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved;\n* Myrsilus \u2013 it is not known when he came to power but some verses by Alcaeus (frag. 129) indicate that the poet, his brothers and Pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that Pittacus subsequently betrayed them; Alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote a drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrant's death (frag. 332);\n* Pittacus \u2013 the dominant political figure of his time, he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of Mytilene and appears to have governed well (590-580&nbsp;BC), even allowing Alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace.\n\nSometime before 600&nbsp;BC, Mytilene fought Athens for control of [[Sigeion]] and Alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting. According to the historian [[Herodotus]],<ref>''Histories'' 5.95</ref> the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious Athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend, Melanippus. It is thought that Alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile, including at least one visit to Egypt. His older brother, Antimenidas, appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and probably took part in the conquest of Askelon. Alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of Antimenides' return, including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent (frag. 350), and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home (frag. 357).\n{{Quotation|\"Alcaeus was in some respects not unlike a [[Royalist]] soldier of the age of the [[Stuarts]].

(1996), Intro. xiii</ref>\n* They composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them;\n* They wrote in their native dialects (Alcaeus and Sappho in Aeolic dialect, Anacreon in Ionic);\n* They preferred quite short, metrically simple stanzas or 'strophes' which they re-used in many poems \u2014 hence the 'Alcaic' and 'Sapphic' stanzas, named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them.\nThe other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions, performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses. However, this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited, or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance. Even the private reflections of Alcaeus, ostensibly sung at dinner parties, still retain a public function.<ref name=\"university19\">{{cite book|first=Gregory |last=Nagy|title=Lyric and Greek Myth (The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology)|publisher= ed.

Alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own 'down-to-earth' style and Sappho's more 'celestial' qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess (as cited above), and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane, each emphasising different elements in that balance.<ref name=\"university19\"/>\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] exhorts us to \"Observe in Alcaeus the sublimity, brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power, his splendid figures, and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect; and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs,\"<ref>''Imit. 422'', quoted from Easby-Smith in ''Songs of Alcaeus''</ref> while [[Quintilian]], after commending Alcaeus for his excellence \"in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals; in his language he is concise, exalted, careful and often like an orator;\" goes on to add: \"but he descended into wantonness and amours, though better fitted for higher things.\"<ref>Quintillian 10.1.63, quoted by D.Campbell in ''G.L.P'', p. 288</ref>\n\n===Poetic genres===\nThe works of Alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres.\n* '''Political songs''': Alcaeus often composed on a political theme, covering the power struggles on Lesbos with the passion and vigour of a partisan, cursing his opponents,<ref>fr. 129</ref> rejoicing in their deaths,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">fr. 332</ref> delivering blood-curdling homilies on the consequences of political inaction<ref>fr. S262</ref> and exhorting his comrades to heroic defiance, as in one of his 'ship of state' allegories.<ref>fr. 6</ref> Commenting on Alcaeus as a political poet, the scholar [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] once observed that \"...if you removed the meter you would find political rhetoric.\"<ref>''Imit. 422'', quoted by Campbell in ''G.L.P.'', p. 286</ref>\n* '''Drinking songs''': According to the grammarian [[Athenaeus]], Alcaeus made every occasion an excuse for drinking and he has provided posterity several quotes in proof of it.<ref>Athenaeus 10.430c</ref> Alcaeus exhorts his friends to drink in celebration of a tyrant's death,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">fr. 332</ref> to drink away their sorrows,<ref>Frs. 335, 346</ref> to drink because life is short<ref>fr. 38A</ref> and along the lines ''in vino veritas'',<ref>fr. 333</ref> to drink through winter storms<ref>fr. 338</ref> and to drink through the heat of summer.<ref>fr. 347</ref> The latter poem in fact paraphrases verses from [[Hesiod]],<ref>Hesiod ''Op.'' 582\u20138</ref> re-casting them in Asclepiad meter and Aeolian dialect.\n* '''Hymns''': Alcaeus sang about the gods in the spirit of the [[Homeric hymns]], to entertain his companions rather than to glorify the gods and in the same meters that he used for his 'secular' lyrics.<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), p. 286</ref> There are for example fragments in 'Sapphic' meter praising the [[Dioscuri]],<ref>fr. 34a</ref> [[Hermes]]<ref>fr. 308c</ref> and the river [[Maritsa|Hebrus]]<ref>fr. 45</ref> (a river significant in Lesbian mythology since it was down its waters that the head of [[Orpheus]] was believed to have floated singing, eventually crossing the sea to Lesbos and ending up in a temple of Apollo, as a symbol of Lesbian supremacy in song).<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), pp. 292\u20133</ref> According to [[Porphyrion]], the hymn to Hermes was imitated by Horace in one of his own 'sapphic' odes (C.1.10: ''Mercuri, facunde nepos Atlantis'').<ref>David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 213</ref>\n* '''Love songs''': Almost all Alcaeus' amorous verses, mentioned with disapproval by Quintilian above, have vanished without trace. There is a brief reference to his love poetry in a passage by [[Cicero]].<ref>Cicero, ''Tusc. Disp.'' 4.71</ref> [[Horace]], who often wrote in imitation of Alcaeus, sketches in verse one of the Lesbian poet's favourite subjects \u2014 Lycus of the black hair and eyes (C.1.32.11-12: ''nigris oculis nigroque/crine decorum''). It is possible that Alcaeus wrote amorously about Sappho, as indicated in an earlier quote.<ref>fr. 384; however, Liberman (1999) reads \"Aphro\" (\u1f0c\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9; a diminutive of \"Aphrodite\"), instead of \"Sappho\".</ref>\n* '''Miscellaneous''': Alcaeus wrote on such a wide variety of subjects and themes that contradictions in his character emerge. The grammarian Athenaeus quoted some verses about perfumed ointments to prove just how unwarlike Alcaeus could be<ref>fr. 362, Athenaeus 15.687d</ref> and he quoted his description of the armour adorning the walls of his house<ref>fr. 357</ref> as proof that he could be unusually warlike for a lyric poet.<ref>Athenaeus 14.627a</ref> Other examples of his readiness for both warlike and unwarlike subjects are lyrics celebrating his brother's heroic exploits as a Babylonian mercenary<ref>fr. 350</ref> and  lyrics sung in a rare meter (Sapphic Ionic in minore) in the voice of a distressed girl,<ref>fr. 10B</ref> \"Wretched me, who share in all ills!\" \u2014 possibly imitated by Horace in an ode in the same meter (C.3.12: ''Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci'').<ref name=\"literature214\">David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P.

The language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences \u2014 the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning, comprising an exhortation (\"Let's drink!), a rhetorical question (\"Why are we waiting for the lamps?\") and a justifying statement (Only an inch of daylight left.)<ref>David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and E.

Like many of his poems (e.g., frs. 38, 326, 338, 347, 350), it begins with a verb (in this case \"Let's drink!\") and it includes a proverbial expression (\"Only an inch of daylight left\") though it is possible that he coined it himself.<ref name=\"David A 1982 page 287\"/>\n\n===A hymn (fr. 34)===\nAlcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm-tossed ship of state.

Thus for example Heraclitus 'The Allegorist'<ref>Donald. A. Russell and David Konstan (ed.s and tran.s.), ''Heraclitus:Homeric Problems'', Society of Biblical Literature (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pLf2PNEy53AC&pg=PP14 Introduction]</ref> quoted fr. 326 and part of fr. 6, about ships in a storm, in his study on Homer's use of allegory.<ref>Heraclitus ''All''.5</ref> The hymn to Hermes, fr308(b), was quoted by [[Hephaestion (grammarian)]]<ref>Hephaestion ''Ench.'' xiv.1</ref> and both he and [[Libanius]], the rhetorician, quoted the first two lines of fr. 350,<ref>Hephaestion ''Ench.'' x 3; Libanus ''Or.'' 13.5</ref> celebrating the return from Babylon of Alcaeus' brother. The rest of fr. 350 was paraphrased in prose by the historian/geographer [[Strabo]].<ref>Strabo 13.617</ref> Many fragments were supplied in quotes by [[Athenaeus]], principally on the subject of wine-drinking, but fr. 333, \"wine, window into a man\", was quoted much later by the Byzantine grammarian, [[John Tzetzes]].<ref>Tzetzes ''Alex.'' 212</ref>\n\nThe first 'modern' publication of Alcaeus' verses appeared in a Greek and Latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by Michael Neander, published at Basle in 1556. This was followed by another edition of the nine poets, collected by [[Henricus Stephanus]] and published in Paris in 1560. Fulvius Ursinus compiled a fuller collection of Alcaic fragments, including a commentary, which was published at Antwerp in 1568. The first separate edition of Alcaeus was by Christian David Jani and it was published at Halle in 1780. The next separate edition was by August Matthiae, Leipzig 1827.\n\nSome of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century. Thus for example two separate quotes by Athenaeus<ref>Athenaeus 15.674cd, 15.687d</ref> were united by [[Theodor Bergk]] to form fr. 362. Three separate sources were combined to form fr. 350, as mentioned above, including a prose paraphrase from Strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter, a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of Otto Hoffmann, [[Karl Otfried Muller]]<ref>M\u00fcller, Karl Otfried, \"Ein Bruder des Dichters Alk\u00e4os ficht unter Nebukadnezar,\" ''Rheinisches Museum'' 1 (1827):287.</ref> and [[Franz Heinrich Ludolf Ahrens]]. The discovery of the Oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research. In fact, eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri \u2014 frs. 9, 38A, 42, 45, 34, 129, 130 and most recently S262. These fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with 'educated guesses', including for example a \"brilliant supplement\" by [[Maurice Bowra]] in fr. 34, a hymn to the Dioscuri that includes a description of [[St Elmo's fire]] in the ship's rigging.<ref>David.
