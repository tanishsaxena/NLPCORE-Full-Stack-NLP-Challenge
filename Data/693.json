Numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in the Indian Subcontinent and in East Africa.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn=0-7486-0687-4 |pages=199\u2013206}}</ref> Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Im\u0101ms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] Im\u0101m and his followers. Although the Jubilees have no religious significance, they serve to reaffirm the Imamat's worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life, especially in the developing countries.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nThe Jubilees of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, are well remembered. During his 72 years of Imamat (1885\u20131957), the community celebrated his Golden (1937), Diamond (1946) and Platinum (1954) Jubilees. To show their appreciation and affection, the Ism\u0101'\u012bliyya weighed their Imam in gold, diamonds and, symbolically, in platinum, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn [[British Raj|India]] and later in [[Pakistan]], social development institutions were established, in the words of Aga Khan III, \"for the relief of humanity\". They included institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and the Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies. ''Diamond Jubilee High School for Girls'' were established throughout the remote Northern Areas of what is now Pakistan. In addition, scholarship programs, established at the time of the Golden Jubilee to give assistance to needy students, were progressively expanded. In East Africa, major social welfare and economic development institutions were established. Those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres, and a modern, fully equipped [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|hospital]] in [[Nairobi]]. Among the economic development institutions established in East Africa were companies such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company, which are quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and have become major players in national development.\n\nSir Sultan Mahomed Shah also introduced organizational forms that gave Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/> These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], far-reaching social, economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs resided. In 1947, British rule in the Indian Subcontinent was replaced by the sovereign, independent nations of [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and later [[Bangladesh]], resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property. In the Middle East, the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956 as well as the preceding crisis in Iran, demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism, which was as assertive of the region's social and economic aspirations as of its political independence. Africa was also set on its course to [[decolonisation]], swept by what [[Harold Macmillan]], the then British prime minister, termed the \"wind of change\". By the early 1960s, most of East and Central Africa, where the majority of the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] population on the continent resided, including [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Madagascar]], Rwanda, Burundi and [[Zaire]], had attained their political independence.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Ismailism", "values": [{"name": "collapsed", "value": "1"}]}, {"name": "cite
