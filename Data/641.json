First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]] which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to the national goal set by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It achieved its goal of crewed lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on another celestial body, while the final [[Apollo 17]] mission marked the sixth [[Moon landing]] and the ninth crewed mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Apollo project"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Baidu's autonomous vehicle Apollo project"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Apolong"}]}, {"name": "Short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1961\u20131972 United States human spaceflight program, which landed the first humans on the lunar surface"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2014"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2012"}]}, {"name": "Infobox space program\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Apollo program"}, {"name": "image", "value": "[[File:Apollo program.svg|frameless|upright]]"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "The letter \"A\" printed with a depiction of a trans-lunar trajectory streaking across; the Moon and Earth are depicted on opposite sides of the \"A\", with Apollo's face outlined on the Moon"}, {"name": "country", "value": "United States"}, {"name": "organization", "value": "[[NASA]]"}, {"name": "purpose", "value": "Crewed [[lunar landing]]"}, {"name": "cost", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  | $25.4 billion (1973)<ref name=\"ApolloCost\" />\n  | ${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|25400000000|1966|r=2}}}} ({{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}){{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}}\n  }}"}, {"name": "status", "value": "Completed"}, {"name": "duration", "value": "1961\u20131972"}, {"name": "firstflight", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  | [[Saturn I SA-1|SA-1]]\n  | {{Start date|1961|10|27}}\n  }}"}, {"name": "firstcrewed", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  | [[Apollo 7]]\n  | {{Start date|1968|10|11}}\n  }}"}, {"name": "lastflight", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  | [[Apollo 17]]\n  | {{Start date|1972|12|19}}\n  }}"}, {"name": "successes", "value": "32"}, {"name": "failures", "value": "2 ([[Apollo 1]] and [[Apollo 13|13]])"}, {"name": "partialfailures", "value": "1 ([[Apollo 6]])"}, {"name": "launchsite", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  | [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy]]\n  | [[Kennedy Space Center]]\n  | [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands]]\n  }}"}, {"name": "crewvehicle", "value": "{{Hlist|[[Apollo command and service module|Apollo CSM]]|[[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo LM]]}}"}, {"name": "launcher", "value": "{{Hlist|[[Little Joe II]]|[[Saturn I]]|[[Saturn IB]]|[[Saturn V]]}}"}]}, {"name": "Unbulleted list\n  ", "values": [{"name": "$25.4 billion (1973)<ref name", "value": "\"ApolloCost\" />"}, {"name": "1", "value": "${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|25400000000|1966|r=2}}}} ({{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}){{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}}"}]}, {"name": "format price", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{Inflation|US-GDP|25400000000|1966|r=2}}"}]}, {"name": "Inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US-GDP"}, {"name": "2", "value": "25400000000"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1966"}, {"name": "r", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "Inflation-year", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US-GDP"}]}, {"name": "Inflation-fn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US-GDP"}]}, {"name": "Unbulleted list\n  ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Saturn I SA-1|SA-1]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "{{Start date|1961|10|27}}"}]}, {"name": "Start date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "2", "value": "10"}, {"name": "3", "value": "27"}]}, {"name": "Unbulleted list\n  ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Apollo 7]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "{{Start date|1968|10|11}}"}]}, {"name": "Start date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1968"}, {"name": "2", "value": "10"}, {"name": "3", "value": "11"}]}, {"name": "Unbulleted list\n  ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Apollo 17]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "{{Start date|1972|12|19}}"}]}, {"name": "Start date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1972"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12"}, {"name": "3", "value": "19"}]}, {"name": "Unbulleted list\n  ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Kennedy Space Center]]"}, {"name": "3", "value": "[[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands]]"}]}, {"name": "Hlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Apollo command and service module|Apollo CSM]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo LM]]"}]}, {"name": "Hlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Little Joe II]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Saturn I]]"}, {"name": "3", "value": "[[Saturn IB]]"}, {"name": "4", "value": "[[Saturn V]]"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "842"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lb"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kg"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Background", "paragraphs": "===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D.

Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L.

Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F.

Many engineers feared that rendezvous and docking, maneuvers which had not been attempted in [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]], would be nearly impossible in [[lunar orbit]]. LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], who became a champion of LOR.<ref name=\"hansen24\">[[#Hansen|Hansen 1999]], pp. 35-39</ref> The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.6: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-6.html \"Settling the Mode Issue\"]. pp. 81-83</ref>\n\nBut even after NASA reached internal agreement, it was far from smooth sailing.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.<ref>[[#Wilford|Wilford 1969]], p. 167</ref> Also, there was no provision for docking with the lunar module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/apsr/Apollopt2-2.pdf |title=Apollo Program Summary Report |date=April 1975 |publisher=NASA |location=Houston, TX |pages=3-66\u20134-12 |format=PDF |id=JSC-09423 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Apollo command and service module"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "11.42"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "12.83"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "12250"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lb"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kg"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "24.6"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "12.83"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "51300"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lb"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kg"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "54000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lb"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kg"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://history.nasa.gov/apsr/Apollopt2-2.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo Program Summary Report"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 1975"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Houston, TX"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "3-66\u20134-12"}, {"name": "format", "value": "PDF"}, {"name": "id", "value": "JSC-09423"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "August 1, 2013"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "Apollo Lunar Module", "paragraphs": "{{main|Apollo Lunar Module}}\n[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Lander - 5927 NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] [[Lunar Module]] ''Eagle'' on the Moon, photographed by [[Neil Armstrong]]]]\n\nThe [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module.

The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second uncrewed test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be crewed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=George M. |authorlink=George Low |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Office, NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |lccn=75600071 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=Testing and Retesting To Get Ready For flight |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-4-6.html}}</ref>\n\nThis was followed on April 4, 1968, by [[Apollo 6]] (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo{{nbsp}}6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo{{nbsp}}6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ready to fly men, canceling a third uncrewed test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal\"]</ref>\n\n===Crewed development missions===\n\n<imagemap>\nFile:Apollo manned development missions insignia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Apollo crewed development mission patches.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers. The '''A''' missions were uncrewed Saturn V validation; '''B''' was uncrewed LM validation using the Saturn IB; '''C''' was crewed CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB; '''D''' was the first crewed CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch); '''E''' would be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight; '''F''' would be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a \"dress rehearsal\"); and '''G''' would be the first crewed landing. The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include '''H''' lunar landings, '''I''' for lunar orbital survey missions, and '''J''' for extended-stay lunar landings.<ref name=\"3Q1967\">[[#Ertel et al.|Ertel et al. 1978]], p. 157</ref>\n\nThe delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on human-rating the LM and Saturn{{nbsp}}V. Apollo{{nbsp}}4 (AS-501) was the first uncrewed flight of the Saturn{{nbsp}}V, carrying a Block{{nbsp}}I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second uncrewed test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be crewed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=George M. |authorlink=George Low |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Office, NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |lccn=75600071 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=Testing and Retesting To Get Ready For flight |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-4-6.html}}</ref>\n\nThis was followed on April 4, 1968, by [[Apollo 6]] (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo{{nbsp}}6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo{{nbsp}}6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ready to fly men, canceling a third uncrewed test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress

Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers. The '''A''' missions were uncrewed Saturn V validation; '''B''' was uncrewed LM validation using the Saturn IB; '''C''' was crewed CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB; '''D''' was the first crewed CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch); '''E''' would be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight; '''F''' would be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a \"dress rehearsal\"); and '''G''' would be the first crewed landing.

Apollo{{nbsp}}4 (AS-501) was the first uncrewed flight of the Saturn{{nbsp}}V, carrying a Block{{nbsp}}I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second uncrewed test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be crewed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=George M. |authorlink=George Low |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Office, NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |lccn=75600071 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=Testing and Retesting To Get Ready For flight |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-4-6.html}}</ref>\n\nThis was followed on April 4, 1968, by [[Apollo 6]] (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo{{nbsp}}6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo{{nbsp}}6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ready to fly men, canceling a third uncrewed test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal\"]</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 11 30th Anniversary: Manned Apollo Missions"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA History Office"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "March 3, 2011"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110220232013/https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/missions.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "February 20, 2011"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Low"}, {"name": "first", "value": "George M."}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "George Low"}, {"name": "editor-last", "value": "Cortright"}, {"name": "editor-first", "value": "Edgar M"}, {"name": "editor-link", "value": "Edgar Cortright"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo Expeditions to the Moon"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "August 1, 2013"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1975"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Scientific and Technical Information Office, NASA"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Washington, D.C."}, {"name": "oclc", "value": "1623434"}, {"name": "lccn", "value": "75600071"}, {"name": "id", "value": "NASA SP-350"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Testing and Retesting To Get Ready For flight"}, {"name": "chapterurl", "value": "http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-4-6.html"}]}], "id": 25}, {"title": "Crewed development missions", "paragraphs": "\n<imagemap>\nFile:Apollo manned development missions insignia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Apollo crewed development mission patches.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth.

These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM.

While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high.{{sfn|Mindell|2008|pp=125-131}}\n\nTechnologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by [[Project Gemini]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=181\u2013182, 205\u2013208}} The Apollo project was enabled by NASA's adoption of new advances in [[semiconductor]] [[electronic technology]], including [[metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs) in the [[Interplanetary Monitoring Platform]] (IMP)<ref>{{cite book |title=Interplanetary Monitoring Platform |date=29 August 1989 |publisher=[[NASA]] |pages=1, 11, 134 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800012928.pdf |accessdate=12 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=H.
