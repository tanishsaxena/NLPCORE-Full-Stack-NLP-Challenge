The group's name is an [[acronym]] of the first letters of their first names. They became one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|most commercially successful acts]] in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]], giving [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] its first triumph in the contest. They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition.\n\nDuring the band's main active years, it was composed of two married couples: F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus, and Lyngstad and Andersson. With the increase of their popularity, their personal lives suffered which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages. The relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with latter compositions featuring darker and more introspective lyrics.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbf9zlm9tNE Comments about this period start around time 1:10].

Virginmedia.com. Retrieved 19 April 2014.</ref> They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of [[Apple Corps]]. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including \"No Response\" that hit number-three in 1965, \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", and \"Consolation\", all of which hit number-one in 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=86\u201387}}</ref> Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote his first [[Svensktoppen]] entry, \"Sagan om lilla Sofie\" (\"The Story of Little Sophie\"), in 1968.\n\n[[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]] (born 25 April 1945 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden) also began his musical career at the age of 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted [[the Hootenanny Singers]], a popular Swedish [[folk music|folk]]\u2013[[skiffle]] group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and the Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was \"Isn't It Easy to Say\", a song later recorded by the Hep Stars. [[Stig Anderson]] was the manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of the [[Polar Music]] label.<ref name=\":0\" /> He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (\"Sweet Sixties\"), recorded by Brita Borg, and the Hep Stars' 1969 hit \"Speleman\" (\"Fiddler\").\n\nAndersson wrote and submitted the song \"Hej, Clown\" for [[Melodifestivalen 1969]], the national festival to select the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Swedish entry]] to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=110}}</ref> On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called ''[[Lycka]]'' (\"Happiness\"), which included original songs sung by both men. Their partners were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; F\u00e4ltskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the Hootenanny Singers until the middle of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.\n\n[[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]] (born 5 April 1950 in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]], Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: \"Jag var s\u00e5 k\u00e4r\" (\"I Was So in Love\"). Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of [[schlager music|schlager]] style songs. F\u00e4ltskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as [[Connie Francis]]. Along with her own compositions, she recorded [[Cover version|covers]] of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish [[folkpark]]s. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.\n\nDuring filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, F\u00e4ltskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971. F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=162}}</ref> and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to F\u00e4ltskog's third studio album, ''[[Som jag \u00e4r]]'' (\"As I Am\") (1970). In 1972, F\u00e4ltskog starred as [[Mary Magdalene]] in the original Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, F\u00e4ltskog released five studio albums.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=112\u2013129 and 135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid \"Frida\" Lyngstad]] (born 15 November 1945 in Bj\u00f8rk\u00e5sen in [[Ballangen]], Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the middle of 1967, she won a national talent competition with \"En ledig dag\" (\"A Day Off\") a Swedish version of the bossa nova song \"A Day in Portofino\", which is included in the EMI compilation ''[[Frida 1967\u20131972]]''. The first prize was a recording contract with [[EMI]] Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3{{sfrac|1|2}}-hour documentary ''[[Frida \u2013 The DVD]]''. Lyngstad released several [[schlager]] style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, \"Min egen stad\" (\"My Own Town\"), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and F\u00e4ltskog during a TV show in early 1968.\n\nLyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single \"Peter Pan\" in September 1969\u2014her first collaboration with Benny & Bj\u00f6rn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, ''[[Frida (album)|Frida]]'', which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, ''[[Frida ensam]]'', which included a Swedish rendition of \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=41\u201358}}</ref>\n\n====First live performance and the start of \"Festfolket\"====\nAn attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, ''Lycka'', which was to be released in September 1970. F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, \"Festfolket\" (which translates from Swedish to mean both \"Party People\" and \"Engaged Couples\"), on 1 November 1970 in [[Gothenburg]].\n\nThe cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit \"Hej, gamle man\" (\"Hello, Old Man\")\u2013the first Bj\u00f6rn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====First record together \"Hej, gamle man\"====\n\"Hej, gamle man\", a song about an old [[Salvation Army]] soldier, became the quartet's first hit. The record was credited to '''Bj\u00f6rn & Benny''' and reached number five on the sales charts and number one on [[Svensktoppen]], staying on the latter chart (which was not a chart linked to sales or airplay) for 15 weeks.\n\nIt was during 1971 that the four artists began working together more, adding vocals to the others' recordings. F\u00e4ltskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own. Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=163\u2013170}}</ref>\n\n===1970\u20131973: Forming the group===\nAfter the 1970 release of ''Lycka'', two more singles credited to \"Bj\u00f6rn & Benny\" were released in Sweden, \"Det kan ingen doktor hj\u00e4lpa\" (\"No Doctor Can Help with That\") and \"T\u00e4nk om jorden vore ung\" (\"Imagine If Earth Was Young\"), with more prominent vocals by F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad\u2013and moderate chart success.\n\nF\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus, now married, started performing together with Andersson on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks in the middle of 1971.\n\n[[Stig Anderson]], founder and owner of [[Polar Music]], was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. \"One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit,\" he predicted.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=150}}</ref> Stig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=173}}</ref> Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song \"S\u00e4g det med en s\u00e5ng\" (\"Say It with a Song\") for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform.

Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited to ''Bj\u00f6rn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid''. The song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=185}}</ref> The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number 114 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' singles chart and number 117 on the ''[[Record World]]'' singles chart. Labeled as ''Bj\u00f6rn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka)'', it was released there through [[Playboy Records]]. However, according to Stig Anderson, \"People Need Love\" could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers.<ref>Interview with ''Songwriter'' magazine, 6, 1981, pp.23\u201325.</ref>\n\n====\"Ring Ring\"====\n[[File:ABBA - Popzien 1973 4.png|thumb|left|ABBA (known as Bj\u00f6rn & Benny Agnetha & Anni-Frid/Frida) at Popzien, 1973]]\nIn 1973, the band and their manager Stig Anderson decided to have another try at Melodifestivalen, this time with the song \"[[Ring Ring (ABBA song)|Ring Ring]]\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The studio sessions were handled by [[Michael B. Tretow]], who experimented with a \"[[wall of sound]]\" production technique that became the wholly new sound. Stig Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by [[Neil Sedaka]] and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a surefire winner. However, on 10 February 1973, the song came third in Melodifestivalen; thus it never reached the Eurovision Song Contest itself. Nevertheless, the group released their debut studio album, also called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''. The album did well and the \"Ring Ring\" single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa. However, Stig Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=191\u2013211}}</ref>\n\nWhen Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog gave birth to her daughter Linda in 1973,<ref name=\":0\" /> she was replaced for a short period by Inger Brundin on a trip to West Germany.\n\n====Official naming====\nIn 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA (a [[palindrome]]). At first, this was a play on words, as [[Abba Seafood|Abba]] is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an abbreviation. However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets. A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as \"ABBA\". The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=210}}</ref> [[Fred Bronson]] reported for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that F\u00e4ltskog told him in a 1988 interview that \"[ABBA] had to ask permission and the factory said, 'O.K., as long as you don't make us feel ashamed for what you're doing{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"Fred Bronson, Billboard\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8505890/abba-waterloo-global-conquest-eurovision-win |title=45 Years Ago Today, ABBA Started Its Global Conquest With Eurovision Win for 'Waterloo' |last=Bronson |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Bronson |date=April 6, 2019 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> \"ABBA\" is an [[acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: '''A'''gnetha, '''B'''j\u00f6rn, '''B'''enny, and '''A'''nni-Frid.<ref name=\"official_bio_2\">{{cite web|title=ABBA's biography, page 2 |publisher=abbasite.com |url=http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626205305/http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 June 2003 |accessdate=16 January 2008 }}</ref> The earliest known example of \"ABBA\" written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in [[Stockholm]] dated 16 October 1973. This was first written as \"Bj\u00f6rn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida\", but was subsequently crossed out with \"ABBA\" written in large letters on top.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n====Official logo====\n[[File:ABBA-Logo.svg|right|thumb|This well-known logo for ABBA was designed by Rune S\u00f6derqvist in 1976]]\nTheir official logo, distinct with the backward \u2018B', was designed by Rune S\u00f6derqvist, who designed most of ABBA's record sleeves. The logo first appeared on the French compilation album, Golden Double Album, released in May 1976 by [[Disques Vogue]], and would henceforth be used for all official releases.<ref>Abba Fan Club Magazine, Helga van de Kar, \"1976 \u2013 Year in Review,\" December 2016, p. 12</ref>\n\nThe idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang \"Bubi\" Heilemann ([[:de:Wolfgang Heilemann|de]]) on a velvet jumpsuit photo shoot for the teenage magazine [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]. On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that Benny Andersson reversed his letter \"B\"; this prompted discussions about the mirrored \"B\", and the members of ABBA agreed on the mirrored letter. From 1976 onward, the first \"B\" in the logo version of the name was \"mirror-image\" reversed on the band's promotional material, thus becoming the group's [[registered trademark]].\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the group's catalogue, PolyGram began using variations of the ABBA logo, employing a different font. In 1992, Polygram added a crown emblem to it for the first release of the ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'' compilation. After Universal Music purchased PolyGram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalogue returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080721023557/http://abbamail.com/feature/logo25th.htm ABBA Logo 25th Anniversary] Retrieved from Internet Archive 10 January 2014.</ref>\n\n===1973\u20131976: Breakthrough===\n\n====Eurovision Song Contest 1974====\n[[File:ABBA - TopPop 1974 1.png|thumb|right|ABBA on Dutch TV in April 1974: Clockwise from top left [[Benny Andersson]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]], [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]]]]\nAs the group entered the Melodifestivalen with \"[[Ring Ring (ABBA song)|Ring Ring]]\" but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry, Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest.\n\nUlvaeus, Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters, as well as the band itself. In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the [[Melodifestivalen 1974]] and from a number of new songs, the upbeat song \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" was chosen; the group was now inspired by the growing [[glam rock]] scene in England.\n\nABBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Eurovision Song Contest. Winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]] on 6 April 1974 (and singing \"Waterloo\" in English instead of their native tongue) gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows; thus the band saw the \"Waterloo\" single chart in many European countries. \"Waterloo\" was ABBA's first number-one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany. In the United States, the song peaked at number-six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there. Albeit a short promotional visit, it included their first performance on American television, ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. The album ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' only peaked at number 145 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, but received unanimous high praise from the US critics: ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively ... an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project\", while ''[[Creem]]'' characterised it as \"a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions\".{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nABBA's follow-up single, \"[[Honey, Honey]]\", peaked at number 27 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a number-two hit in West Germany. However, in the United Kingdom, ABBA's British record label, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of \"Ring Ring\" instead of \"Honey, Honey\", and a cover version of the latter by [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] peaked at number 10. Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other. \"Ring Ring\" failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Eurovision [[one-hit wonder]].\n\n====Post-Eurovision====\nIn November 1974, ABBA embarked on their first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany and Austria. It was not as successful as the band had hoped, since most of the venues did not sell out. Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland. The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was very different. They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for. Live performances continued in the middle of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a fourteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland. Their [[Stockholm]] show at the [[Gr\u00f6na Lund]] amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=268}}</ref> Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus later said that \"If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo, we were trying to be more like [[The Sweet]], a semi-glam rock group, which was stupid because we were always a pop group.\"<ref name=Guardian2014>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/10/abba-interview-bjorn-ulvaeus-frida-lyngstad |title=Abba on Drugs, Eminem and Why Writing Great Pop is a Job for Young People|first= Tim|last= Jonze |work=The Guardian |date= 10 April 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1974, \"So Long\" was released as a single in the United Kingdom but it received no airplay from Radio 1 and failed to chart. In the middle of 1975, ABBA released \"[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]\", which again received little airplay on Radio 1 but managed to climb the charts, to number 38. Later that year, the release of their self-titled third studio album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and single \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\" brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13. \"SOS\" also became ABBA's second number-one single in Germany and their third in Australia. Success was further solidified with \"[[Mamma Mia (ABBA song)|Mamma Mia]]\" reaching number-one in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. In the United States, \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\" peaked at number 10 on the [[Record World]] Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, picking up the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975.\n\nThe success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases. By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack. The eponymous ''ABBA '' album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at number 165 on the ''Cashbox'' album chart and number 174 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Opinions were voiced, by ''Creem'' in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured \"a very sloppy promotional campaign\". Nevertheless, the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press. ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' went as far as saying that \"there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abba's marketing, creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts\", while ''Creem'' wrote: \"SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles.\"\n\nIn Australia, the airing of the music videos for \"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\" and \"Mamma Mia\" on the nationally broadcast TV pop show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' (which premiered in November 1974) saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity, and ''Countdown'' become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos. This started an immense interest for ABBA in Australia, resulting in both the single and album holding down the No. 1 positions on the charts for months.\n\n===1976\u20131981: Superstardom===\nIn March 1976, the band released the compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]''. It became their first UK number-one album, and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time, eventually selling more than a million copies there. Also included on ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'' was a new single, \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", which went to number-one in at least thirteen countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, and the single went on to sell over 10&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Collins, Karen  |url=http://www.tagg.org/mmmsp/fernando.html |title=Fernando the Flute&nbsp;\u2013 Details |publisher=Tagg.org |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> In Australia, \"Fernando\" occupied the top position for a then record breaking 14 weeks (and stayed in the chart for 40 weeks), and was the longest-running chart-topper there for over 40 years until it was overtaken by [[Ed Sheeran]]'s \"[[Shape of You]]\" in May 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/ed-sheeran-breaks-australian-music-chart-record-with-shape-of-you/news-story/d2d55f5a04b09dab9db04b795b2e9512 |title=Ed Sheeran breaks Australian music chart record with Shape of You |date=2 May 2017 |publisher=News Corp |location=Australia |first=Cameron |last=Adams |access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref> It still remains as one of the best-selling singles of all time in Australia. Also in 1976, the group received its first international prize, with \"Fernando\" being chosen as the \"Best Studio Recording of 1975\". In the United States, \"Fernando\" reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It topped the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart, ABBA's first American number-one single on any chart. At the same time, Germany released a compilation named ''The Very Best of ABBA'', also becoming a number-one album there whereas the ''Greatest Hits'' compilation followed a few months later to number-two on the German charts, despite all similarities with ''The Very Best'' album.\n\n[[File:Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson 1976b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benny Andersson]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], 1976|left]]\n\nThe group's fourth studio album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', a number-one best-seller in Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', and mostly appreciative notices from US critics. Hit after hit flowed from ''Arrival'': \"[[Money, Money, Money]]\", another number-one in Germany and Australia, and \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\", ABBA's sixth consecutive German number-one as well as another UK number-one. The real sensation was \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK, Germany and Australia, but also reaching number-one in the United States. In South Africa, ABBA had astounding success with \"Fernando\", \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" being among the top 20 best-selling singles for 1976\u201377. In 1977, ''Arrival'' was nominated for the inaugural [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] in the category \"Best International Album of the Year\". By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In ''Frida \u2013 The DVD'', Lyngstad explains how she and F\u00e4ltskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years.\n\nThe band's popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and \"Dancing Queen\" became the only ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number-one position on other ''Billboard'' charts, including ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary and [[Hot Dance Club Play]]). Nevertheless, ''Arrival'' finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\n====European and Australian tour====\nIn January 1977, ABBA embarked on their first major tour. The group's status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. They opened their much anticipated tour in [[Oslo]], Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta ''The Girl with the Golden Hair''. The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting [[Gothenburg]], Copenhagen, Berlin, [[Cologne]], Amsterdam, [[Antwerp]], [[Essen]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hamburg]] and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in [[Manchester]], Birmingham, Glasgow and two sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5&nbsp;million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. Along with praise (\"ABBA turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records\", wrote ''[[Creem]]''), there were complaints that \"ABBA performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage\" (''[[Melody Maker]]''). One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed.\n\n[[File:Abba 28011977 15 200.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]] at the opening concert of ABBA's European and Australian Tour in [[Oslo]], 28 January 1977]]\nAfter the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert. However, all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career. Upon their arrival in [[Melbourne]], a civic reception was held at the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000. In Melbourne, the group played three concerts at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]] with 14,500 at each including the Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] and his family. At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert. In [[Adelaide]], the group performed one concert at [[Football Park|West Lakes Football Stadium]] in front of 20,000 people, with another 10,000 listening outside. During the first of five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the [[Perth Entertainment Centre|Entertainment Centre]]. The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention (\"Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour...and the media coverage of the quartet rivals that set to cover the upcoming Royal tour of Australia\", wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''), and is captured on film in ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', directed by [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]].\n\nThe Australian tour and its subsequent ''ABBA: The Movie'' produced some ABBA lore, as well. F\u00e4ltskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's \"pin-up girl\", a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline \"Agnetha's bottom tops dull show\". When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: \"Don't they have bottoms in Australia?\"<ref>DVD documentaries: ''The Winner Takes It All'' (2002) and ''Super Troupers'' (2004)</ref>\n\nIn December 1977, ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more ambitious fifth album ''[[ABBA: The Album]]'', released to coincide with the debut of ''ABBA: The Movie''. Although the album was less well received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: \"[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]\" and \"[[Take a Chance on Me]]\", which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number three, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart in the US. Although \"Take a Chance on Me\" did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single there, selling more copies than \"Dancing Queen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=382}}</ref> ''The Album'' also included \"[[Thank You for the Music]]\", the B-side of \"[[Eagle (song)|Eagle]]\" in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and was belatedly released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983. \"[[Thank You for the Music]]\" has become one of the best loved and best known ABBA songs without being released as a single during the group's lifetime.\n\n====Polar Music Studio formation====\n[[File:Sportpalatset Stockholm 2010.jpg|thumb|Polar Music Studios was situated in this building at 58 Sankt Eriksgatan in Stockholm until 2004]]\n\nBy 1978 ABBA were one of the biggest bands in the world. They converted a vacant cinema into the [[Polar Music]] Studio, a state-of-the-art studio in [[Stockholm]]. The studio was used by several other bands; notably [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' were recorded there. During May, the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign, performing alongside [[Andy Gibb]] on [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s TV show. Recording sessions for the single \"[[Summer Night City]]\" were an uphill struggle,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} but upon release the song became another hit for the group. The track would set the stage for ABBA's foray into [[disco]] with their next album.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=383\u2013386}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 January 1979, the group performed \"[[Chiquitita]]\" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] held at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to celebrate UNICEF's Year of the Child. ABBA donated the [[copyright]] of this worldwide hit to the [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]; see [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].<ref>\"Bee Gees, Olivia were a hit with the VIPs\" (11 January 1979).

The news caused interest from the media and led to speculation about the band's future. ABBA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group and that the divorce would not affect them.<ref>\"ABBA divorce&nbsp;\u2013 Agnetha moves out\" (17 January 1979). ''The Sun'' (Sydney); p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Nonetheless, the media continued to confront them with this in interviews. To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Andersson and Ulvaeus secretly travelled to [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], where for two weeks they prepared their next album's songs.\n\nThe group's sixth studio album, ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', was released in April 1979, the title track of which was recorded at the famous [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, with the assistance of recording engineer [[Tom Dowd]] amongst others. The album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico, hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the United States. None of the singles from the album reached number-one on the UK charts, but \"[[Chiquitita]]\", \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\", \"[[Angeleyes]]\" (with \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\", released as a double A-side) and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" were all UK Top 5 hits. In Canada, \"I Have a Dream\" became ABBA's second number-one on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart (after \"Fernando\" hit the top previously). Also in 1979, the group released their second compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'', which featured a brand new track: \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", another number-three hit in both the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, the group was paid in oil commodities because of an [[embargo]] on the [[Soviet ruble|ruble]].<ref>Rodgers, Peter (16 March 1980). \"Pop Goes ABBA's $2m Oil Gamble: ABBA May Lose Enormous Amount of Money Following Venture into Oil Market. \" ''The Sunday Times''; Business News, p&nbsp;53</ref>\n\nOn 13 September 1979, ABBA began [[ABBA: The Tour]] at [[Northlands Coliseum]] in Edmonton, Canada, with a full house of 14,000. \"The voices of the band, Agnetha's high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning\", raved ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''.\n\nDuring the next four weeks they played a total of 17 sold-out dates, 13 in the United States and four in Canada. The last scheduled ABBA concert in the United States in Washington, D.C. was cancelled due to F\u00e4ltskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston, when the group's private plane was subjected to [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado|extreme weather conditions]] and was unable to land for an extended period. They appeared at the [[Citi Performing Arts Center|Boston Music Hall]] for the performance 90 minutes late. The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] before a capacity crowd of 18,000. \"ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone who's been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied\", wrote ''[[Record World]]''.\n\nOn 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's [[Wembley Arena]].\n\n====Progression====\n[[File:ABBA - Super Trouper (Polar).jpg|thumbnail|''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', seventh studio album released by the group in 1980]]\nIn March 1980, ABBA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at [[Narita International Airport]], they were besieged by thousands of fans. The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]]. This tour was the last \"on the road\" adventure of their career.\nIn July 1980, ABBA released the single \"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\", the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978). The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and F\u00e4ltskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics, but has stated they were not about his own divorce; F\u00e4ltskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce. In the United States, the single peaked at number-eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary number-one. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse [[Mireille Mathieu]] at the end of 1980&nbsp;\u2013 as \"Bravo tu as gagn\u00e9\", with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. November the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release. The second single from the album, \"[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]\", also hit number-one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from the album, \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", released in 1981 as a [[Twelve-inch single]] single only in selected territories, managed to top the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number-seven on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting 12-inch release in UK chart history.\n\nAlso in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called ''[[Gracias Por La M\u00fasica (album)|Gracias Por La M\u00fasica]]''. This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of \"Chiquitita\", this signalled the group's breakthrough in Latin America. ''ABBA Oro: Grandes \u00c9xitos'', the Spanish equivalent of ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'', was released in 1999.\n\n===1981\u20131982: Final album and performances===\n[[File:ABBA Last Interveiw - Cavett.png|thumb| left|ABBA during the TV special ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' in April 1981]]\n\nIn January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena K\u00e4llersj\u00f6, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party. For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track \"Hovas Vittne\" (a pun on the Swedish name for [[Jehovah's Witness]] and Anderson's birthplace, [[Hova, Sweden|Hova]]) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectable. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona N\u00f6rklit, whom he married in November 1981.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions in early 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March. At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' with the US talk show host [[Dick Cavett]]. ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'', ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies. Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, aging, and loss of innocence. The album's only major single release, \"[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]\", proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. \"One of Us\" was also ABBA's final Top 3 hit in the UK, reaching number-one on some charts (such as Record Mirror).\n\nAlthough it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including Ireland, the UK and Germany, ''The Visitors'' was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia and Japan. A track from the album, \"[[When All Is Said and Done (song)|When All Is Said and Done]]\", was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number-four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with \"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\" and \"One of Us\", dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of ''The Visitors'', which hit the Top Ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\n====Final recording sessions====\nIn the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: \"You Owe Me One\", \"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=455\u201356}}</ref>\n\nBack in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]''. New songwriting and recording sessions took place,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=456\u201357}}</ref> and during October and December, they released the singles \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\"/\"[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]\" and \"[[Under Attack]]\"/\"[[You Owe Me One]]\", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to number-one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. \"Under Attack\", the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n\"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\" were left unreleased on ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. \"I Am the City\" was eventually released on the compilation album ''[[More Gold: More Hits|More ABBA Gold]]'' in 1993, while \"Just Like That\" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=490}}</ref> The chorus section of \"Just Like That\" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the ''ABBA Undeleted'' medley featured on disc 9 of ''The Complete Studio Recordings''. Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of \"Just Like That\" in its entirety, even though the complete version has surfaced on bootlegs.\n\nThe group travelled to London to promote ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' in the first week of November 1982, appearing on ''[[Saturday Superstore]]'' and ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme N\u00f6jesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.bt.com/news/showbiz-news/abba-together-on-stage-again-but-only-to-open-a-taverna-11364034663670|title=ABBA together on stage again \u2013 but only to open a taverna |first=Michael|last=Moran | publisher=Bt.com|date=21 January 2016| access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> through a live link from a TV studio in [[Stockholm]].\n\n====Final performances====\nAndersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with [[Tim Rice]] in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' that was produced in France for television. It was a children's musical utilising 14&nbsp;ABBA songs. [[Alain Boublil|Alain]] and Daniel Boublil, who wrote ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of \"The Winner Takes It All\".\n\nLyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, \"Belle\", a duet with French singer [[Daniel Balavoine]]. The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"[[Arrival (song)|Arrival]]\". As the single \"Belle\" sold well in France, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, \"I Am the Seeker\". \"Abbacadabra\" premiered on 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording \"Belle\" in English as \"Time\", a duet with actor and singer [[B. A. Robertson]]: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Mike Batt. In May 1984, Lyngstad performed \"I Have a Dream\" with a children's choir at the United Nations Organisation Gala, in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|title=Gala de l'ONU (Organisation des Nations Unis) \u2013 United Nations Organisation Gala part 1|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=ABBAONTV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220022027/http://www.abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|archive-date=20 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAll four members made their (at the time, final) public appearance as four friends more than as ABBA in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of \"Tivedshambo\" (which was the first song written by their manager Stig Anderson), for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, [[Claes af Geijerstam]]. They sang a self-written song titled \"Der Kleine Franz\" that was later to resurface in ''Chess''. Also in 1986, ''[[ABBA Live]]'' was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of G\u00f6rel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring G\u00f6rel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song \"Med En Enkel Tulipan\" [[a cappella]].<ref>[http://www.raffem.com/BjornUlvaeusBiogr.htm Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]. raffem.com \u2013 ABBA's last known appearance (1999)</ref>\n\nAndersson has on several occasions performed ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with [[U2]] at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", and a few years later during the final performance of the B & B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]] band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\" with opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], and \"When All Is Said and Done\" with Swede [[Viktoria Tolstoy]]. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of \"Fernando\" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of \"Dancing Queen\" with the Swedish group [[the Real Group]] in 1993, and also re-recorded \"I Have a Dream\" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.\n\n====Break and reunion====\nABBA never officially announced the end of the group or an indefinite break, but it was long considered dissolved after their final public performance together in 1982. Their final public performance together as ABBA before their 2016 reunion was on the British TV programme ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'' (live from Stockholm) on 11 December 1982. While reminiscing on \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\", Ulvaeus said: \"we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one\".<ref>{{cite news | work=YouTube.com| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBG4H6M8alw | title=ABBA The History 1999 Documentary}}</ref> In January 1983, F\u00e4ltskog started recording sessions for a solo album, as Lyngstad had successfully released her album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' some months earlier. Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical ''Chess''. In interviews at the time, Bj\u00f6rn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (\"Who are we without our ladies? Initials of [[Brigitte Bardot]]?\"), and Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in [[Polar Music]] during 1983. Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' movie on 4 July 2008. The individual members' endeavours shortly before and after their final public performance coupled with the collapse of both marriages and the lack of significant activity in the following few years after that widely suggested that the group had broken up.\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson said that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. Ulvaeus said: \"We will never appear on stage again. [...] There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition. I remember [[Robert Plant]] saying [[Led Zeppelin]] were a [[cover band]] now because they cover all their own stuff. I think that hit the nail on the head.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/05/bmabba105.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=ABBA's Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson: We Will Never Reform | first=Chris | last=Hastings | date=5 July 2008}}</ref>\nHowever, on 3 January 2011, F\u00e4ltskog, long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement. She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members. In April 2013, she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with ''[[Die Zeit]]'', stating: \"If they ask me, I'll say yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/musikk/artikkel.php?artid=10102871 |title=Agnetha \u00e5pner for ABBA-gjenforening \u2013 VG Nett |publisher=Vg.no |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a May 2013 interview, F\u00e4ltskog, aged 63 at the time, stated that an ABBA reunion would never occur: \"I think we have to accept that it will not happen, because we are too old and each one of us has their own life. Too many years have gone by since we stopped, and there's really no meaning in putting us together again.\" F\u00e4ltskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms: \"It's always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic.\"<ref name=\"Dave\" /> In an April 2014 interview, F\u00e4ltskog, when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said: \"It's difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: 'ABBA is going to record another song!' But as long as we can sing and play, then why not? I would love to, but it's up to Bj\u00f6rn and Benny.\"<ref name=Guardian2014/>\n\n====Resurgence of public interest====\nThe same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a \"tribute\" show (a children's TV musical named ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' using 14 ABBA songs) spawned new interest in the group's music.\n\nAfter receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo [[Erasure]], who released ''[[Abba-esque]]'', a four track [[extended play]] release featuring cover versions of ABBA songs which topped several European charts in 1992. As [[U2]] arrived in [[Stockholm]] for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of \"Dancing Queen\", playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', a new compilation album. The single \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" received radio airplay in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album. The song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at number 16. With sales of 30 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ie/competitions/display.asp?CompID=7471|title=Win an ABBA GOLD 40th Anniversary Edition + The Singles CD Boxset \u2013 entertainment.ie|last=Entertainment.ie|publisher=}}</ref> ''Gold'' is the best-selling ABBA album, as well as one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums worldwide]].

The same year, ''[[Thank You for the Music (album)|Thank You for the Music]]'', a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members. \"By the end of the twentieth century,\" American critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] wrote a decade later, \"it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them.\"<ref name=\"Klosterman quote\">{{cite book|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|url=https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-4421-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos/page/172 172]|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=T6cFBs1TU9gC&pg=PT203 online copy])</ref>\n\nABBA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts: [[Evan Dando]] of [[the Lemonheads]] recorded a cover version of \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\";<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=504}}</ref> [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and Boyzone's [[Stephen Gately]] have recorded \"[[Chiquitita]]\"; [[Tanita Tikaram]], [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] and [[Steven Wilson]] paid tribute to \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\". [[Cliff Richard]] covered \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", while [[Dionne Warwick]], Peter Cetera, and [[Celebrity Skin (band)|Celebrity Skin]] recorded their versions of \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\". US alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" in concert appearances, while legendary English [[Latin pop]] songwriter [[Richard Daniel Roman]] has recognised ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] covered \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\" with slightly altered lyrics.\n\nTwo different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released. ''ABBA: A Tribute'' coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's \"One of Us\", Army of Lovers \"[[Hasta Ma\u00f1ana]]\", Information Society's \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", Erasure's \"Take a Chance on Me\" (with [[MC Kinky]]), and Lyngstad's a cappella duet with the Real Group of \"Dancing Queen\". A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled ''[[ABBAmania]]'', with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness (\"Money, Money, Money\"), [[Culture Club]] (\"Voulez-Vous\"), [[the Corrs]] (\"The Winner Takes It All\"), Steps (\"Lay All Your Love on Me\", \"I Know Him So Well\"), and a medley entitled \"Thank ABBA for the Music\" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.\n\nIn 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the [[A-Teens]] to allow the group some independence. The group's first album, \"[[The ABBA Generation]]\", consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums. The group disbanded in 2004 due to a gruelling schedule and intentions to go solo. In Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 ''B & B Concerts'', a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but hits both before and after ABBA. The concert was a success, and was ultimately released on CD. It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts. In 2000, ABBA was reported to have turned down an offer of approximately one billion US dollars to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Basham |first=David |date=2 February 2000 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1424667/abba-nixes-billion-dollar-offer-to-reunite/ |title=ABBA Nixes Billion-Dollar Offer To Reunite |work=MTV News }}</ref>\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, all four members made cameo appearances in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video Ever\". Other well-known stars such as [[Rik Mayall]], [[Cher]] and [[Iron Maiden]]'s [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] also made appearances in the video.

Virginmedia.com. Retrieved 19 April 2014.</ref> They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of [[Apple Corps]]. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including \"No Response\" that hit number-three in 1965, \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", and \"Consolation\", all of which hit number-one in 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=86\u201387}}</ref> Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote his first [[Svensktoppen]] entry, \"Sagan om lilla Sofie\" (\"The Story of Little Sophie\"), in 1968.\n\n[[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]] (born 25 April 1945 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden) also began his musical career at the age of 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted [[the Hootenanny Singers]], a popular Swedish [[folk music|folk]]\u2013[[skiffle]] group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and the Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was \"Isn't It Easy to Say\", a song later recorded by the Hep Stars. [[Stig Anderson]] was the manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of the [[Polar Music]] label.<ref name=\":0\" /> He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (\"Sweet Sixties\"), recorded by Brita Borg, and the Hep Stars' 1969 hit \"Speleman\" (\"Fiddler\").\n\nAndersson wrote and submitted the song \"Hej, Clown\" for [[Melodifestivalen 1969]], the national festival to select the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Swedish entry]] to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=110}}</ref> On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called ''[[Lycka]]'' (\"Happiness\"), which included original songs sung by both men. Their partners were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; F\u00e4ltskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the Hootenanny Singers until the middle of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.\n\n[[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]] (born 5 April 1950 in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]], Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: \"Jag var s\u00e5 k\u00e4r\" (\"I Was So in Love\"). Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of [[schlager music|schlager]] style songs. F\u00e4ltskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as [[Connie Francis]]. Along with her own compositions, she recorded [[Cover version|covers]] of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish [[folkpark]]s. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.\n\nDuring filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, F\u00e4ltskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971. F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=162}}</ref> and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to F\u00e4ltskog's third studio album, ''[[Som jag \u00e4r]]'' (\"As I Am\") (1970). In 1972, F\u00e4ltskog starred as [[Mary Magdalene]] in the original Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, F\u00e4ltskog released five studio albums.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=112\u2013129 and 135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid \"Frida\" Lyngstad]] (born 15 November 1945 in Bj\u00f8rk\u00e5sen in [[Ballangen]], Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the middle of 1967, she won a national talent competition with \"En ledig dag\" (\"A Day Off\") a Swedish version of the bossa nova song \"A Day in Portofino\", which is included in the EMI compilation ''[[Frida 1967\u20131972]]''. The first prize was a recording contract with [[EMI]] Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3{{sfrac|1|2}}-hour documentary ''[[Frida \u2013 The DVD]]''. Lyngstad released several [[schlager]] style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, \"Min egen stad\" (\"My Own Town\"), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and F\u00e4ltskog during a TV show in early 1968.\n\nLyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single \"Peter Pan\" in September 1969\u2014her first collaboration with Benny & Bj\u00f6rn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, ''[[Frida (album)|Frida]]'', which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, ''[[Frida ensam]]'', which included a Swedish rendition of \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=41\u201358}}</ref>\n\n====First live performance and the start of \"Festfolket\"====\nAn attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, ''Lycka'', which was to be released in September 1970. F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, \"Festfolket\" (which translates from Swedish to mean both \"Party People\" and \"Engaged Couples\"), on 1 November 1970 in [[Gothenburg]].\n\nThe cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit \"Hej, gamle man\" (\"Hello, Old Man\")\u2013the first Bj\u00f6rn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====First record together \"Hej, gamle man\"====\n\"Hej, gamle man\", a song about an old [[Salvation Army]] soldier, became the quartet's first hit.

Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including \"No Response\" that hit number-three in 1965, \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", and \"Consolation\", all of which hit number-one in 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=86\u201387}}</ref> Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote his first [[Svensktoppen]] entry, \"Sagan om lilla Sofie\" (\"The Story of Little Sophie\"), in 1968.\n\n[[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]] (born 25 April 1945 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden) also began his musical career at the age of 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted [[the Hootenanny Singers]], a popular Swedish [[folk music|folk]]\u2013[[skiffle]] group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and the Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was \"Isn't It Easy to Say\", a song later recorded by the Hep Stars. [[Stig Anderson]] was the manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of the [[Polar Music]] label.<ref name=\":0\" /> He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (\"Sweet Sixties\"), recorded by Brita Borg, and the Hep Stars' 1969 hit \"Speleman\" (\"Fiddler\").\n\nAndersson wrote and submitted the song \"Hej, Clown\" for [[Melodifestivalen 1969]], the national festival to select the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Swedish entry]] to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=110}}</ref> On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called ''[[Lycka]]'' (\"Happiness\"), which included original songs sung by both men. Their partners were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; F\u00e4ltskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the Hootenanny Singers until the middle of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.\n\n[[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]] (born 5 April 1950 in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]], Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: \"Jag var s\u00e5 k\u00e4r\" (\"I Was So in Love\"). Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of [[schlager music|schlager]] style songs. F\u00e4ltskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as [[Connie Francis]]. Along with her own compositions, she recorded [[Cover version|covers]] of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish [[folkpark]]s. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.\n\nDuring filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, F\u00e4ltskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971. F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=162}}</ref> and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to F\u00e4ltskog's third studio album, ''[[Som jag \u00e4r]]'' (\"As I Am\") (1970). In 1972, F\u00e4ltskog starred as [[Mary Magdalene]] in the original Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, F\u00e4ltskog released five studio albums.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=112\u2013129 and 135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid \"Frida\" Lyngstad]] (born 15 November 1945 in Bj\u00f8rk\u00e5sen in [[Ballangen]], Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the middle of 1967, she won a national talent competition with \"En ledig dag\" (\"A Day Off\") a Swedish version of the bossa nova song \"A Day in Portofino\", which is included in the EMI compilation ''[[Frida 1967\u20131972]]''. The first prize was a recording contract with [[EMI]] Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3{{sfrac|1|2}}-hour documentary ''[[Frida \u2013 The DVD]]''. Lyngstad released several [[schlager]] style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, \"Min egen stad\" (\"My Own Town\"), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and F\u00e4ltskog during a TV show in early 1968.\n\nLyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single \"Peter Pan\" in September 1969\u2014her first collaboration with Benny & Bj\u00f6rn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, ''[[Frida (album)|Frida]]'', which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, ''[[Frida ensam]]'', which included a Swedish rendition of \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=41\u201358}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Guinness Book of Rock Stars"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Rees"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Dafydd"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Crampton"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Luke"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Guinness Publishing"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-85112-971-6"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Enfield"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1\u20132"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "86\u201387"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "110"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "162"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "112\u2013129 and 135\u2013136"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "41\u201358"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "First live performance and the start of \"Festfolket\"", "paragraphs": "An attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus.

However, on 10 February 1973, the song came third in Melodifestivalen; thus it never reached the Eurovision Song Contest itself. Nevertheless, the group released their debut studio album, also called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''. The album did well and the \"Ring Ring\" single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa.

At first, this was a play on words, as [[Abba Seafood|Abba]] is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an abbreviation. However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets. A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as \"ABBA\". The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=210}}</ref> [[Fred Bronson]] reported for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that F\u00e4ltskog told him in a 1988 interview that \"[ABBA] had to ask permission and the factory said, 'O.K., as long as you don't make us feel ashamed for what you're doing{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"Fred Bronson, Billboard\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8505890/abba-waterloo-global-conquest-eurovision-win |title=45 Years Ago Today, ABBA Started Its Global Conquest With Eurovision Win for 'Waterloo' |last=Bronson |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Bronson |date=April 6, 2019 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> \"ABBA\" is an [[acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: '''A'''gnetha, '''B'''j\u00f6rn, '''B'''enny, and '''A'''nni-Frid.<ref name=\"official_bio_2\">{{cite web|title=ABBA's biography, page 2 |publisher=abbasite.com |url=http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626205305/http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 June 2003 |accessdate=16 January 2008 }}</ref> The earliest known example of \"ABBA\" written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in [[Stockholm]] dated 16 October 1973.

The logo first appeared on the French compilation album, Golden Double Album, released in May 1976 by [[Disques Vogue]], and would henceforth be used for all official releases.<ref>Abba Fan Club Magazine, Helga van de Kar, \"1976 \u2013 Year in Review,\" December 2016, p. 12</ref>\n\nThe idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang \"Bubi\" Heilemann ([[:de:Wolfgang Heilemann|de]]) on a velvet jumpsuit photo shoot for the teenage magazine [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]. On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that Benny Andersson reversed his letter \"B\"; this prompted discussions about the mirrored \"B\", and the members of ABBA agreed on the mirrored letter. From 1976 onward, the first \"B\" in the logo version of the name was \"mirror-image\" reversed on the band's promotional material, thus becoming the group's [[registered trademark]].\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the group's catalogue, PolyGram began using variations of the ABBA logo, employing a different font. In 1992, Polygram added a crown emblem to it for the first release of the ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'' compilation. After Universal Music purchased PolyGram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalogue returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080721023557/http://abbamail.com/feature/logo25th.htm ABBA Logo 25th Anniversary] Retrieved from Internet Archive 10 January 2014.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "150"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "173"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "174"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1149457"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Cover Art for Bj\u00f6rn and Benny Single \"En Carousel\"/\"Lycka\""}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "discogs"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "23 August 2010"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "182"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "185"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "191\u2013211"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "210"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8505890/abba-waterloo-global-conquest-eurovision-win"}, {"name": "title", "value": "45 Years Ago Today, ABBA Started Its Global Conquest With Eurovision Win for 'Waterloo'"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Bronson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Fred"}, {"name": "author-link", "value": "Fred Bronson"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 6, 2019"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "August 21, 2019"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "ABBA's biography, page 2"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "abbasite.com"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20030626205305/http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "26 June 2003"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "16 January 2008"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2017"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "First hit as Bj\u00f6rn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid/Frida", "paragraphs": "Ulvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements. \"[[People Need Love]]\" was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence.

On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that Benny Andersson reversed his letter \"B\"; this prompted discussions about the mirrored \"B\", and the members of ABBA agreed on the mirrored letter. From 1976 onward, the first \"B\" in the logo version of the name was \"mirror-image\" reversed on the band's promotional material, thus becoming the group's [[registered trademark]].\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the group's catalogue, PolyGram began using variations of the ABBA logo, employing a different font. In 1992, Polygram added a crown emblem to it for the first release of the ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'' compilation.

Later that year, the release of their self-titled third studio album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and single \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\" brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13. \"SOS\" also became ABBA's second number-one single in Germany and their third in Australia. Success was further solidified with \"[[Mamma Mia (ABBA song)|Mamma Mia]]\" reaching number-one in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia.

It topped the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart, ABBA's first American number-one single on any chart. At the same time, Germany released a compilation named ''The Very Best of ABBA'', also becoming a number-one album there whereas the ''Greatest Hits'' compilation followed a few months later to number-two on the German charts, despite all similarities with ''The Very Best'' album.\n\n[[File:Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson 1976b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benny Andersson]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], 1976|left]]\n\nThe group's fourth studio album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', a number-one best-seller in Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', and mostly appreciative notices from US critics. Hit after hit flowed from ''Arrival'': \"[[Money, Money, Money]]\", another number-one in Germany and Australia, and \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\", ABBA's sixth consecutive German number-one as well as another UK number-one. The real sensation was \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK, Germany and Australia, but also reaching number-one in the United States. In South Africa, ABBA had astounding success with \"Fernando\", \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" being among the top 20 best-selling singles for 1976\u201377. In 1977, ''Arrival'' was nominated for the inaugural [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] in the category \"Best International Album of the Year\". By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In ''Frida \u2013 The DVD'', Lyngstad explains how she and F\u00e4ltskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years.\n\nThe band's popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and \"Dancing Queen\" became the only ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number-one position on other ''Billboard'' charts, including ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary and [[Hot Dance Club Play]]). Nevertheless, ''Arrival'' finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\n====European and Australian tour====\nIn January 1977, ABBA embarked on their first major tour. The group's status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. They opened their much anticipated tour in [[Oslo]], Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta ''The Girl with the Golden Hair''. The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting [[Gothenburg]], Copenhagen, Berlin, [[Cologne]], Amsterdam, [[Antwerp]], [[Essen]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hamburg]] and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in [[Manchester]], Birmingham, Glasgow and two sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5&nbsp;million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. Along with praise (\"ABBA turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records\", wrote ''[[Creem]]''), there were complaints that \"ABBA performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage\" (''[[Melody Maker]]''). One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed.\n\n[[File:Abba 28011977 15 200.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]] at the opening concert of ABBA's European and Australian Tour in [[Oslo]], 28 January 1977]]\nAfter the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert. However, all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career. Upon their arrival in [[Melbourne]], a civic reception was held at the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000. In Melbourne, the group played three concerts at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]] with 14,500 at each including the Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] and his family. At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert. In [[Adelaide]], the group performed one concert at [[Football Park|West Lakes Football Stadium]] in front of 20,000 people, with another 10,000 listening outside. During the first of five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the [[Perth Entertainment Centre|Entertainment Centre]]. The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention (\"Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour...and the media coverage of the quartet rivals that set to cover the upcoming Royal tour of Australia\", wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''), and is captured on film in ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', directed by [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]].\n\nThe Australian tour and its subsequent ''ABBA: The Movie'' produced some ABBA lore, as well. F\u00e4ltskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's \"pin-up girl\", a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline \"Agnetha's bottom tops dull show\". When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: \"Don't they have bottoms in Australia?\"<ref>DVD documentaries: ''The Winner Takes It All'' (2002) and ''Super Troupers'' (2004)</ref>\n\nIn December 1977, ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more ambitious fifth album ''[[ABBA: The Album]]'', released to coincide with the debut of ''ABBA: The Movie''. Although the album was less well received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: \"[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]\" and \"[[Take a Chance on Me]]\", which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number three, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart in the US. Although \"Take a Chance on Me\" did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single there, selling more copies than \"Dancing Queen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=382}}</ref> ''The Album'' also included \"[[Thank You for the Music]]\", the B-side of \"[[Eagle (song)|Eagle]]\" in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and was belatedly released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983. \"[[Thank You for the Music]]\" has become one of the best loved and best known ABBA songs without being released as a single during the group's lifetime.\n\n====Polar Music Studio formation====\n[[File:Sportpalatset Stockholm 2010.jpg|thumb|Polar Music Studios was situated in this building at 58 Sankt Eriksgatan in Stockholm until 2004]]\n\nBy 1978 ABBA were one of the biggest bands in the world.

The studio was used by several other bands; notably [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' were recorded there. During May, the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign, performing alongside [[Andy Gibb]] on [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s TV show. Recording sessions for the single \"[[Summer Night City]]\" were an uphill struggle,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} but upon release the song became another hit for the group.

To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Andersson and Ulvaeus secretly travelled to [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], where for two weeks they prepared their next album's songs.\n\nThe group's sixth studio album, ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', was released in April 1979, the title track of which was recorded at the famous [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, with the assistance of recording engineer [[Tom Dowd]] amongst others. The album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico, hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the United States. None of the singles from the album reached number-one on the UK charts, but \"[[Chiquitita]]\", \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\", \"[[Angeleyes]]\" (with \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\", released as a double A-side) and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" were all UK Top 5 hits. In Canada, \"I Have a Dream\" became ABBA's second number-one on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart (after \"Fernando\" hit the top previously). Also in 1979, the group released their second compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'', which featured a brand new track: \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", another number-three hit in both the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, the group was paid in oil commodities because of an [[embargo]] on the [[Soviet ruble|ruble]].<ref>Rodgers, Peter (16 March 1980). \"Pop Goes ABBA's $2m Oil Gamble: ABBA May Lose Enormous Amount of Money Following Venture into Oil Market. \" ''The Sunday Times''; Business News, p&nbsp;53</ref>\n\nOn 13 September 1979, ABBA began [[ABBA: The Tour]] at [[Northlands Coliseum]] in Edmonton, Canada, with a full house of 14,000. \"The voices of the band, Agnetha's high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning\", raved ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''.\n\nDuring the next four weeks they played a total of 17 sold-out dates, 13 in the United States and four in Canada. The last scheduled ABBA concert in the United States in Washington, D.C. was cancelled due to F\u00e4ltskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston, when the group's private plane was subjected to [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado|extreme weather conditions]] and was unable to land for an extended period. They appeared at the [[Citi Performing Arts Center|Boston Music Hall]] for the performance 90 minutes late. The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] before a capacity crowd of 18,000. \"ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone who's been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied\", wrote ''[[Record World]]''.\n\nOn 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's [[Wembley Arena]].\n\n====Progression====\n[[File:ABBA - Super Trouper (Polar).jpg|thumbnail|''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', seventh studio album released by the group in 1980]]\nIn March 1980, ABBA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at [[Narita International Airport]], they were besieged by thousands of fans. The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]]. This tour was the last \"on the road\" adventure of their career.\nIn July 1980, ABBA released the single \"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\", the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978). The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and F\u00e4ltskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics, but has stated they were not about his own divorce; F\u00e4ltskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce. In the United States, the single peaked at number-eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary number-one. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse [[Mireille Mathieu]] at the end of 1980&nbsp;\u2013 as \"Bravo tu as gagn\u00e9\", with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. November the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release. The second single from the album, \"[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]\", also hit number-one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from the album, \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", released in 1981 as a [[Twelve-inch single]] single only in selected territories, managed to top the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number-seven on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting 12-inch release in UK chart history.\n\nAlso in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called ''[[Gracias Por La M\u00fasica (album)|Gracias Por La M\u00fasica]]''. This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of \"Chiquitita\", this signalled the group's breakthrough in Latin America. ''ABBA Oro: Grandes \u00c9xitos'', the Spanish equivalent of ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'', was released in 1999.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Collins, Karen"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.tagg.org/mmmsp/fernando.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Fernando the Flute&nbsp;\u2013 Details"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Tagg.org"}, {"name": "date", "value": "25 August 2009"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "31 January 2010"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/ed-sheeran-breaks-australian-music-chart-record-with-shape-of-you/news-story/d2d55f5a04b09dab9db04b795b2e9512"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ed Sheeran breaks Australian music chart record with Shape of You"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2 May 2017"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "News Corp"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Australia"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Cameron"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Adams"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "13 December 2019"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "382"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2014"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "383\u2013386"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": "European and Australian tour", "paragraphs": "In January 1977, ABBA embarked on their first major tour.

For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track \"Hovas Vittne\" (a pun on the Swedish name for [[Jehovah's Witness]] and Anderson's birthplace, [[Hova, Sweden|Hova]]) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectable. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona N\u00f6rklit, whom he married in November 1981.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions in early 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March. At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' with the US talk show host [[Dick Cavett]]. ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'', ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies. Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, aging, and loss of innocence. The album's only major single release, \"[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]\", proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. \"One of Us\" was also ABBA's final Top 3 hit in the UK, reaching number-one on some charts (such as Record Mirror).\n\nAlthough it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including Ireland, the UK and Germany, ''The Visitors'' was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia and Japan. A track from the album, \"[[When All Is Said and Done (song)|When All Is Said and Done]]\", was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number-four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with \"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\" and \"One of Us\", dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of ''The Visitors'', which hit the Top Ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\n====Final recording sessions====\nIn the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: \"You Owe Me One\", \"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=455\u201356}}</ref>\n\nBack in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]''. New songwriting and recording sessions took place,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=456\u201357}}</ref> and during October and December, they released the singles \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\"/\"[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]\" and \"[[Under Attack]]\"/\"[[You Owe Me One]]\", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to number-one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. \"Under Attack\", the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n\"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\" were left unreleased on ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. \"I Am the City\" was eventually released on the compilation album ''[[More Gold: More Hits|More ABBA Gold]]'' in 1993, while \"Just Like That\" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=490}}</ref> The chorus section of \"Just Like That\" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the ''ABBA Undeleted'' medley featured on disc 9 of ''The Complete Studio Recordings''. Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of \"Just Like That\" in its entirety, even though the complete version has surfaced on bootlegs.\n\nThe group travelled to London to promote ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' in the first week of November 1982, appearing on ''[[Saturday Superstore]]'' and ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme N\u00f6jesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.bt.com/news/showbiz-news/abba-together-on-stage-again-but-only-to-open-a-taverna-11364034663670|title=ABBA together on stage again \u2013 but only to open a taverna |first=Michael|last=Moran | publisher=Bt.com|date=21 January 2016| access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> through a live link from a TV studio in [[Stockholm]].\n\n====Final performances====\nAndersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with [[Tim Rice]] in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' that was produced in France for television. It was a children's musical utilising 14&nbsp;ABBA songs. [[Alain Boublil|Alain]] and Daniel Boublil, who wrote ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of \"The Winner Takes It All\".\n\nLyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, \"Belle\", a duet with French singer [[Daniel Balavoine]]. The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"[[Arrival (song)|Arrival]]\". As the single \"Belle\" sold well in France, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, \"I Am the Seeker\". \"Abbacadabra\" premiered on 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording \"Belle\" in English as \"Time\", a duet with actor and singer [[B. A. Robertson]]: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Mike Batt. In May 1984, Lyngstad performed \"I Have a Dream\" with a children's choir at the United Nations Organisation Gala, in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|title=Gala de l'ONU (Organisation des Nations Unis) \u2013 United Nations Organisation Gala part 1|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=ABBAONTV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220022027/http://www.abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|archive-date=20 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAll four members made their (at the time, final) public appearance as four friends more than as ABBA in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of \"Tivedshambo\" (which was the first song written by their manager Stig Anderson), for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, [[Claes af Geijerstam]]. They sang a self-written song titled \"Der Kleine Franz\" that was later to resurface in ''Chess''. Also in 1986, ''[[ABBA Live]]'' was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of G\u00f6rel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring G\u00f6rel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song \"Med En Enkel Tulipan\" [[a cappella]].<ref>[http://www.raffem.com/BjornUlvaeusBiogr.htm Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]. raffem.com \u2013 ABBA's last known appearance (1999)</ref>\n\nAndersson has on several occasions performed ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with [[U2]] at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", and a few years later during the final performance of the B & B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]] band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\" with opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], and \"When All Is Said and Done\" with Swede [[Viktoria Tolstoy]]. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of \"Fernando\" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of \"Dancing Queen\" with the Swedish group [[the Real Group]] in 1993, and also re-recorded \"I Have a Dream\" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.\n\n====Break and reunion====\nABBA never officially announced the end of the group or an indefinite break, but it was long considered dissolved after their final public performance together in 1982. Their final public performance together as ABBA before their 2016 reunion was on the British TV programme ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'' (live from Stockholm) on 11 December 1982. While reminiscing on \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\", Ulvaeus said: \"we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one\".<ref>{{cite news | work=YouTube.com| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBG4H6M8alw | title=ABBA The History 1999 Documentary}}</ref> In January 1983, F\u00e4ltskog started recording sessions for a solo album, as Lyngstad had successfully released her album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' some months earlier. Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical ''Chess''. In interviews at the time, Bj\u00f6rn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (\"Who are we without our ladies? Initials of [[Brigitte Bardot]]?\"), and Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in [[Polar Music]] during 1983. Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' movie on 4 July 2008. The individual members' endeavours shortly before and after their final public performance coupled with the collapse of both marriages and the lack of significant activity in the following few years after that widely suggested that the group had broken up.\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson said that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. Ulvaeus said: \"We will never appear on stage again. [...] There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition. I remember [[Robert Plant]] saying [[Led Zeppelin]] were a [[cover band]] now because they cover all their own stuff. I think that hit the nail on the head.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/05/bmabba105.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=ABBA's Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson: We Will Never Reform | first=Chris | last=Hastings | date=5 July 2008}}</ref>\nHowever, on 3 January 2011, F\u00e4ltskog, long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement. She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members. In April 2013, she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with ''[[Die Zeit]]'', stating: \"If they ask me, I'll say yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/musikk/artikkel.php?artid=10102871 |title=Agnetha \u00e5pner for ABBA-gjenforening \u2013 VG Nett |publisher=Vg.no |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a May 2013 interview, F\u00e4ltskog, aged 63 at the time, stated that an ABBA reunion would never occur: \"I think we have to accept that it will not happen, because we are too old and each one of us has their own life. Too many years have gone by since we stopped, and there's really no meaning in putting us together again.\" F\u00e4ltskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms: \"It's always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic.\"<ref name=\"Dave\" /> In an April 2014 interview, F\u00e4ltskog, when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said: \"It's difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: 'ABBA is going to record another song!' But as long as we can sing and play, then why not? I would love to, but it's up to Bj\u00f6rn and Benny.\"<ref name=Guardian2014/>\n\n====Resurgence of public interest====\nThe same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a \"tribute\" show (a children's TV musical named ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' using 14 ABBA songs) spawned new interest in the group's music.\n\nAfter receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo [[Erasure]], who released ''[[Abba-esque]]'', a four track [[extended play]] release featuring cover versions of ABBA songs which topped several European charts in 1992. As [[U2]] arrived in [[Stockholm]] for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of \"Dancing Queen\", playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', a new compilation album. The single \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" received radio airplay in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album. The song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at number 16. With sales of 30 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ie/competitions/display.asp?CompID=7471|title=Win an ABBA GOLD 40th Anniversary Edition + The Singles CD Boxset \u2013 entertainment.ie|last=Entertainment.ie|publisher=}}</ref> ''Gold'' is the best-selling ABBA album, as well as one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums worldwide]].

The same year, ''[[Thank You for the Music (album)|Thank You for the Music]]'', a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members. \"By the end of the twentieth century,\" American critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] wrote a decade later, \"it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them.\"<ref name=\"Klosterman quote\">{{cite book|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|url=https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-4421-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos/page/172 172]|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=T6cFBs1TU9gC&pg=PT203 online copy])</ref>\n\nABBA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts: [[Evan Dando]] of [[the Lemonheads]] recorded a cover version of \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\";<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=504}}</ref> [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and Boyzone's [[Stephen Gately]] have recorded \"[[Chiquitita]]\"; [[Tanita Tikaram]], [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] and [[Steven Wilson]] paid tribute to \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\". [[Cliff Richard]] covered \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", while [[Dionne Warwick]], Peter Cetera, and [[Celebrity Skin (band)|Celebrity Skin]] recorded their versions of \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\". US alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" in concert appearances, while legendary English [[Latin pop]] songwriter [[Richard Daniel Roman]] has recognised ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] covered \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\" with slightly altered lyrics.\n\nTwo different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released. ''ABBA: A Tribute'' coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's \"One of Us\", Army of Lovers \"[[Hasta Ma\u00f1ana]]\", Information Society's \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", Erasure's \"Take a Chance on Me\" (with [[MC Kinky]]), and Lyngstad's a cappella duet with the Real Group of \"Dancing Queen\". A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled ''[[ABBAmania]]'', with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness (\"Money, Money, Money\"), [[Culture Club]] (\"Voulez-Vous\"), [[the Corrs]] (\"The Winner Takes It All\"), Steps (\"Lay All Your Love on Me\", \"I Know Him So Well\"), and a medley entitled \"Thank ABBA for the Music\" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.\n\nIn 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the [[A-Teens]] to allow the group some independence. The group's first album, \"[[The ABBA Generation]]\", consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums. The group disbanded in 2004 due to a gruelling schedule and intentions to go solo. In Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 ''B & B Concerts'', a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but hits both before and after ABBA. The concert was a success, and was ultimately released on CD. It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts. In 2000, ABBA was reported to have turned down an offer of approximately one billion US dollars to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Basham |first=David |date=2 February 2000 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1424667/abba-nixes-billion-dollar-offer-to-reunite/ |title=ABBA Nixes Billion-Dollar Offer To Reunite |work=MTV News }}</ref>\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, all four members made cameo appearances in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video Ever\". Other well-known stars such as [[Rik Mayall]], [[Cher]] and [[Iron Maiden]]'s [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] also made appearances in the video. It was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release, retitled ''The Last Video'' at the request of the former ABBA members. The video was made using puppet models of the members of the band. The video has surpassed 8 millions views on [[YouTube]] as of November 2019. \n\nIn 2005, all four members of ABBA appeared at the Stockholm premiere of the musical ''Mamma Mia!''.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4263745.stm|title= Abba Reunite for Musical Premiere|accessdate=16 July 2008|date= 14 February 2005|work= BBC News | location=London}}</ref> On 22 October 2005, at the [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest|50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest]], \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.<ref name=50th>{{cite news| work= BBC News| date= 23 October 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm |title= Abba Win 'Eurovision 50th' Vote|accessdate=20 July 2006}}</ref> On 4 July 2008, all four ABBA members were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the film ''[[Mamma Mia!

Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: \"You Owe Me One\", \"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=455\u201356}}</ref>\n\nBack in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]''. New songwriting and recording sessions took place,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=456\u201357}}</ref> and during October and December, they released the singles \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\"/\"[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]\" and \"[[Under Attack]]\"/\"[[You Owe Me One]]\", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to number-one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. \"Under Attack\", the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n\"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\" were left unreleased on ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. \"I Am the City\" was eventually released on the compilation album ''[[More Gold: More Hits|More ABBA Gold]]'' in 1993, while \"Just Like That\" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=490}}</ref> The chorus section of \"Just Like That\" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the ''ABBA Undeleted'' medley featured on disc 9 of ''The Complete Studio Recordings''. Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of \"Just Like That\" in its entirety, even though the complete version has surfaced on bootlegs.\n\nThe group travelled to London to promote ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' in the first week of November 1982, appearing on ''[[Saturday Superstore]]'' and ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme N\u00f6jesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.bt.com/news/showbiz-news/abba-together-on-stage-again-but-only-to-open-a-taverna-11364034663670|title=ABBA together on stage again \u2013 but only to open a taverna |first=Michael|last=Moran | publisher=Bt.com|date=21 January 2016| access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> through a live link from a TV studio in [[Stockholm]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "455\u201356"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "456\u201357"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "490"}]}, {"name": "Cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://home.bt.com/news/showbiz-news/abba-together-on-stage-again-but-only-to-open-a-taverna-11364034663670"}, {"name": "title", "value": "ABBA together on stage again \u2013 but only to open a taverna"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Michael"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Moran"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Bt.com"}, {"name": "date", "value": "21 January 2016"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "22 July 2016"}]}], "id": 20}, {"title": "Final performances", "paragraphs": "Andersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with [[Tim Rice]] in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' that was produced in France for television. It was a children's musical utilising 14&nbsp;ABBA songs. [[Alain Boublil|Alain]] and Daniel Boublil, who wrote ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of \"The Winner Takes It All\".\n\nLyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, \"Belle\", a duet with French singer [[Daniel Balavoine]]. The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"[[Arrival (song)|Arrival]]\". As the single \"Belle\" sold well in France, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, \"I Am the Seeker\". \"Abbacadabra\" premiered on 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording \"Belle\" in English as \"Time\", a duet with actor and singer [[B. A. Robertson]]: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Mike Batt. In May 1984, Lyngstad performed \"I Have a Dream\" with a children's choir at the United Nations Organisation Gala, in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|title=Gala de l'ONU (Organisation des Nations Unis) \u2013 United Nations Organisation Gala part 1|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=ABBAONTV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220022027/http://www.abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|archive-date=20 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAll four members made their (at the time, final) public appearance as four friends more than as ABBA in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of \"Tivedshambo\" (which was the first song written by their manager Stig Anderson), for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, [[Claes af Geijerstam]]. They sang a self-written song titled \"Der Kleine Franz\" that was later to resurface in ''Chess''. Also in 1986, ''[[ABBA Live]]'' was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of G\u00f6rel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring G\u00f6rel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song \"Med En Enkel Tulipan\" [[a cappella]].<ref>[http://www.raffem.com/BjornUlvaeusBiogr.htm Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]. raffem.com \u2013 ABBA's last known appearance (1999)</ref>\n\nAndersson has on several occasions performed ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with [[U2]] at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", and a few years later during the final performance of the B & B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]] band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\" with opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], and \"When All Is Said and Done\" with Swede [[Viktoria Tolstoy]]. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of \"Fernando\" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of \"Dancing Queen\" with the Swedish group [[the Real Group]] in 1993, and also re-recorded \"I Have a Dream\" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Gala de l'ONU (Organisation des Nations Unis) \u2013 United Nations Organisation Gala part 1"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "11 October 2017"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "ABBAONTV"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220022027/http://www.abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "20 February 2018"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}], "id": 21}, {"title": "Break and reunion", "paragraphs": "ABBA never officially announced the end of the group or an indefinite break, but it was long considered dissolved after their final public performance together in 1982.

While reminiscing on \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\", Ulvaeus said: \"we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one\".<ref>{{cite news | work=YouTube.com| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBG4H6M8alw | title=ABBA The History 1999 Documentary}}</ref> In January 1983, F\u00e4ltskog started recording sessions for a solo album, as Lyngstad had successfully released her album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' some months earlier. Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical ''Chess''. In interviews at the time, Bj\u00f6rn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (\"Who are we without our ladies? Initials of [[Brigitte Bardot]]?\"), and Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in [[Polar Music]] during 1983. Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' movie on 4 July 2008. The individual members' endeavours shortly before and after their final public performance coupled with the collapse of both marriages and the lack of significant activity in the following few years after that widely suggested that the group had broken up.\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson said that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. Ulvaeus said: \"We will never appear on stage again. [...] There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were.

As [[U2]] arrived in [[Stockholm]] for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of \"Dancing Queen\", playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', a new compilation album. The single \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" received radio airplay in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album. The song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at number 16.

The same year, ''[[Thank You for the Music (album)|Thank You for the Music]]'', a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members. \"By the end of the twentieth century,\" American critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] wrote a decade later, \"it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them.\"<ref name=\"Klosterman quote\">{{cite book|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|url=https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-4421-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos/page/172 172]|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=T6cFBs1TU9gC&pg=PT203 online copy])</ref>\n\nABBA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts: [[Evan Dando]] of [[the Lemonheads]] recorded a cover version of \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\";<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=504}}</ref> [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and Boyzone's [[Stephen Gately]] have recorded \"[[Chiquitita]]\"; [[Tanita Tikaram]], [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] and [[Steven Wilson]] paid tribute to \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\". [[Cliff Richard]] covered \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", while [[Dionne Warwick]], Peter Cetera, and [[Celebrity Skin (band)|Celebrity Skin]] recorded their versions of \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\". US alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" in concert appearances, while legendary English [[Latin pop]] songwriter [[Richard Daniel Roman]] has recognised ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] covered \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\" with slightly altered lyrics.\n\nTwo different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released. ''ABBA: A Tribute'' coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's \"One of Us\", Army of Lovers \"[[Hasta Ma\u00f1ana]]\", Information Society's \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", Erasure's \"Take a Chance on Me\" (with [[MC Kinky]]), and Lyngstad's a cappella duet with the Real Group of \"Dancing Queen\". A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled ''[[ABBAmania]]'', with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness (\"Money, Money, Money\"), [[Culture Club]] (\"Voulez-Vous\"), [[the Corrs]] (\"The Winner Takes It All\"), Steps (\"Lay All Your Love on Me\", \"I Know Him So Well\"), and a medley entitled \"Thank ABBA for the Music\" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.\n\nIn 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the [[A-Teens]] to allow the group some independence. The group's first album, \"[[The ABBA Generation]]\", consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums. The group disbanded in 2004 due to a gruelling schedule and intentions to go solo. In Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 ''B & B Concerts'', a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but hits both before and after ABBA. The concert was a success, and was ultimately released on CD. It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts. In 2000, ABBA was reported to have turned down an offer of approximately one billion US dollars to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Basham |first=David |date=2 February 2000 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1424667/abba-nixes-billion-dollar-offer-to-reunite/ |title=ABBA Nixes Billion-Dollar Offer To Reunite |work=MTV News }}</ref>\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, all four members made cameo appearances in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video Ever\". Other well-known stars such as [[Rik Mayall]], [[Cher]] and [[Iron Maiden]]'s [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] also made appearances in the video. It was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release, retitled ''The Last Video'' at the request of the former ABBA members.

The former reached number-one in Australia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland; number-two in Austria, France and New Zealand, and number-three in Canada, Norway, Sweden and the US. In May 1986, the musical premiered in London's West End, and ran for almost three years. ''Chess'' also opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged ''Chess p\u00e5 svenska'' (''Chess in Swedish'') in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers ''\"Han \u00e4r en man, han \u00e4r ett barn\"'' (\"He's a Man, He's a Child\") and ''\"Gl\u00f6m mig om du kan\"'' (\"Forget Me If You Can\"). In 2008, the musical was again revived for a successful staging at London's Royal Albert Hall which was subsequently released on DVD, and then in two successful separate touring productions in the United States and United Kingdom, in 2010.\n\n[[File:Benny Andersson ABBA.jpg|thumb|Benny Andersson during a performance in [[Minnesota]], 2006]]\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus' next project, ''[[Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la]]'', an epic Swedish musical, premiered in [[Malm\u00f6]], in southern Sweden in October 1995.

The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]] in 1985 and 1987. In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his own label, Mono Music, called \"''[[Klinga mina klockor]]''\" (\"Ring My Bells\"), containing material inspired by Swedish folk music&nbsp;\u2013 and followed it with a second album titled ''[[November 1989 (album)|November 1989]]''.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet [[Ainbusk|Ainbusk Singers]], giving them two hits: \"Lassie\" and \"''\u00c4lska mig''\" (\"Love me\"), and later produced ''[[Shapes (album)|Shapes]]'', an English-language album by group's [[Josefin Nilsson]] with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to [[Roy Andersson]]'s ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''). In 2001, Andersson formed his own band, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (BAO), which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio [[Svensktoppen]] charts; the song ''\"Du \u00e4r min man\"'' (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by [[Helen Sj\u00f6holm]], spent 278 weeks there between 2004 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815042720/http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872|archivedate=15 August 2007|date=2 July 2006|title=Aktuell lista |publisher=sr.se |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> Andersson released his third album [[BAO 3]] in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sj\u00f6holm and [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]], as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000.\n\n[[File:2015-12-12-030 Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus (29193749840) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus lecturing in Stockholm, 2015]] Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of the Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of [[V\u00e4stervik]], singing their 1966 hit \"Marianne\".\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical ''[[Mamma Mia! (musical)|Mamma Mia!]]'', alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres. They were also involved in the production of the successful film version of the musical, which opened in July 2008. Andersson produced the soundtrack utilising many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours. Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a \"fisherman\" piano player in the \"Dancing Queen\" scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing a [[lyre]] during the closing credits.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently they wrote seven songs for Andersson's 2011 BAO album ''O Klang Och Jubeltid'', performed as usual by vocalists Sj\u00f6holm, K\u00f6rberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO (now renamed the Benny Andersson Band) released their first international album, ''The Story of a Heart''. The album was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English; the new title song premiered on BBC2's ''Ken Bruce Show''. A Swedish-language version of the title track, ''\"Sommaren Du Fick\"'' (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm. In May 2009, Andersson released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel ''Hotel Rival'', titled \"[[2nd Best to None]]\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work.\n\nIn 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]], titled ''\"Jag vill bli gammal\"'' (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show ''\"Your Days Are Numbered\"'', which was never recorded and released, but was performed on television. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album ''[[Winter Symphony]]''. New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song ''\"Innan Gryningen\"'' (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for [[Barbara Dickson]] (performed live, but not yet recorded and released). In 2007, they wrote the song ''\"Han som har vunnit allt\"'' (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor/singer [[Anders Ekborg]].\n\nUlvaeus also wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Andersson's solo albums:  \"After the Rain\" (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], for her Andersson tribute album ''I Let the Music Speak'', and \"I Walk with You Mama\" (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989). [[Barbara Dickson]] recorded (but not yet released) a Bj\u00f6rn & Benny song entitled \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the track was eventually released by Australian ''Mamma Mia!'' musical star [[Anne Wood]] on her album of ABBA covers, ''[[Divine Discontent]]''. {{as of|2012|October|}}, Ulvaeus has mentioned writing new material with Andersson for a BAO Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO 'box'). Andersson (together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson) composed music for a Swedish language obscure musical, \"Hj\u00e4lp S\u00f6kes\" (\"Help Wanted\"), which premiered In February 2013. Andersson has also written music for a documentary film about [[Olof Palme]], re-recording the track \"Sorgmarsch\" (\"[[Dirge]]\").\n\n===Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad===\n{{Main|1=Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog|2=Anni-Frid Lyngstad}}\n[[File:Anni Frid Lyngstad on The Story of ABBA 1982.jpg|thumb|Lyngstad in 1982]]\nBoth female members of ABBA pursued solo careers on the international scene after their work with the group. In 1982, Lyngstad chose [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer and vocalist [[Phil Collins]] to produce the album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' and unveiled the hit single and video \"[[I Know There's Something Going On]]\" in August of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/somethings-going-on-mw0000193886|title=Something's Going On \u2013 Frida {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> The single became a number-one hit in Belgium and Switzerland and was a Top 10 hit in Australia, Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Sweden. The track also proved successful in the US, peaking at No. 13 (and spending almost four months on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100). [[Sveriges Television]] documented this historical event, by filming the whole recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with Lyngstad, Collins, Ulvaeus and Andersson as well as all the musicians. This documentary and the promotion videos from the album are included in ''[[Frida \u2013 The DVD]]''.\n\nLyngstad's second international solo album, ''[[Shine (Frida album)|Shine]]'' (produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]), was recorded in Paris and released in 1984. This would be Lyngstad's final studio album release for twelve years. It featured \"Slowly\", the last known Andersson-Ulvaeus composition to have been recorded by one of the former female ABBA vocalists to date. The promotional videos and clips for \"Shine\" are included in ''Frida \u2013 The DVD''.\n\nIn 1992, Lyngstad was chosen to be the chairperson for the environmental organisation ''\"Artister f\u00f6r milj\u00f6n\"'' (\"Artists for the Environment\") in Sweden. She was chairperson for this organisation until 1995. To mark her interests for the environment, she recorded the [[Julian Lennon]] song \"Saltwater\" and performed it live in Stockholm. She arranged and financed summer camps for poor children in Sweden, focusing on environmental and ecological issues. Her environmental work for the organisation led to the decision to record again. The album ''[[Djupa andetag]]'' (''Deep Breaths'') was released in 1996 and became a number-one success in Sweden. The lyrics for the single, \"\u00c4ven en blomma\" (\"Even a Flower\"), deal with environmental issues.\n\nIn 2004, Lyngstad recorded a song entitled  \"The Sun Will Shine Again\", written especially for her and released with former [[Deep Purple]] member [[Jon Lord]]. The couple made several TV performances with the song in Germany.\n\nOn 5 December 2005,<ref name=\"releasedatedocumentary\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60446/frida-admits-longing-for-abba-reunion|title=Frida Admits Longing For ABBA Reunion|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref> [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] released her box set, [[Frida \u2013 4xCD 1xDVD]], consisting of the solo albums she recorded for the Polar Label and the 3{{frac|1|2}}-hour documentary ''Frida \u2013 The DVD''.

Many rare clips are included in the set and each performance is explained by Lyngstad herself. The interview with Lyngstad was filmed in the [[Swiss Alps]] in mid-2005.\n\nLyngstad returned to the recording studio in 2010 to record vocals for the [[Cat Stevens]] song \"[[Morning Has Broken]]\", for Swedish guitarist [[Georg Wadenius]]'s album ''Reconnection''.

It peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in January 1982, and has since been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music. The album title is derived from one of Scandinavia's best-known Christmas carols, \"[[Nu t\u00e4ndas tusen juleljus]]\" (\"Now a thousand Christmas candles are lit\").\n\nIn 1983, F\u00e4ltskog released the solo album ''[[Wrap Your Arms Around Me]]'', which achieved platinum sales in Sweden. This included the single \"[[The Heat Is On (Agnetha song)|The Heat Is On]]\", which was a hit in Europe and Scandinavia. It reached number-one in Sweden and Norway and peaked at number-two in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the United States, F\u00e4ltskog earned a ''Billboard'' Top 30 hit with \"Can't Shake Loose\". The title track of the album was another successful hit, topping the charts in Belgium and Denmark, reaching the Top 5 in the Netherlands, South Africa and Sweden, and the Top 20 in Germany and France. The album sold 1.2 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=470}}</ref> The album was produced Mike Chapman, also known for his work with [[The Sweet]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], [[Suzi Quatro]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Pat Benatar]] and [[The Knack]].\n[[File:Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog on The Story of ABBA 1982.jpg|thumb|left|F\u00e4ltskog in 1982]]\n\nF\u00e4ltskog's second English-language solo album, ''[[Eyes of a Woman]]'' (produced by [[Eric Stewart]] of [[10cc]]), was released in March 1985. It peaked at number two in Sweden (becoming a platinum seller). The first single from the album was her self-penned \"I Won't Let You Go\". Her duet with Ola H\u00e5kansson, \"The Way You Are\", was a number-one hit in Sweden in 1986 and was awarded double platinum status.\n\nIn early 1987, F\u00e4ltskog recorded a Swedish-language album, ''Kom f\u00f6lj med i v\u00e5r karusell'' (''Come Join Us on Our Carousel'') with her son Christian and a children's choir. The single \"P\u00e5 S\u00f6ndag\" (\"On Sunday\") received significant airplay on Swedish radio and even made the Swedish Top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.\n\nAlso in 1987, F\u00e4ltskog released her third English-language solo album, the [[Peter Cetera]]-produced ''[[I Stand Alone (Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog album)|I Stand Alone]]'', which also included the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary duet with Cetera, \"[[I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)]]\", as well as the European charting singles \"The Last Time\" and \"Let It Shine\". The album was extremely successful in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at number-one and was awarded double-platinum status. Shortly after some minor European promotion for the album in early 1988, F\u00e4ltskog withdrew from public life and halted her music career. In 1996, she released her autobiography, ''As I Am'', and a compilation album featuring her solo hits alongside some ABBA classics.\n\nIn 2004, F\u00e4ltskog made a successful comeback, with the release of the critically acclaimed album ''[[My Colouring Book]]'', containing covers of songs that had the most impact on her teenage years in the 1960s. It debuted at number-one in Sweden (achieving triple-platinum status), and was a Top 10 hit in Denmark, Finland and Germany. It also became F\u00e4ltskog's second solo album to reach the UK Top 20, peaking at number 12. The single \"[[If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind]]\" (a cover of the song recorded by [[Cilla Black]]) became F\u00e4ltskog's biggest solo hit in the UK, reaching number 11, while peaking at number-two in her native Sweden. A second single, \"[[When You Walk in the Room]]\", was released but met with less success. In January 2007, F\u00e4ltskog sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy K\u00f6rberg at the after party for the final performance of the musical, ''Mamma Mia!'', in Stockholm, at which Andersson and Ulvaeus were also present.\n\nIn May 2013, F\u00e4ltskog released a solo album entitled ''[[A (Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog album)|A]]'' through [[Universal Music Group|Universal International]]. In a promotional interview, F\u00e4ltskog explained that the album was unplanned and it was after she heard the first three songs that she felt that she \"had to do this [record the album]\". She also revealed that she completed singing lessons prior to recording the album, as she felt her throat was \"a bit rusty\". F\u00e4ltskog stated that she would not be undertaking any tours or live performances in support of the album, explaining: \"I'm not that young anymore. I don't have the energy to do that, and also I don't want to travel too much.\" The title of the album was conceived of by the studio production team.<ref name=\"Dave\">{{cite news|title=A Dancing Queen Extends Her Reign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/arts/music/agnetha-faltskog-of-abba-back-with-a-new-album.html|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 May 2013|author=Itzkoff, Dave }}</ref>  ''A'' proved  successful upon release, reaching the Top 10 in many European countries, including Germany, Sweden and the UK (where it peaked at number-six and is F\u00e4ltskog's highest-charting solo album to date), as well as Australia.\n\nIn 2018, Lyngstad and multi-Grammy winning Jazz trumpeter [[Arturo Sandoval]] released a reworking of the ABBA song \"Andante, Andante\" as a single, which is also featured on Sandoval's album ''Ultimate Duets''.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Benny Andersson"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.icethesite.com/content/kristina.aspx"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la&nbsp;\u2013 The Musical"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "icethesite"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "23 August 2010"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100801093057/http://icethesite.com/content/kristina.aspx"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "1 August 2010"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2010-05-08"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070815042720/http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "15 August 2007"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2 July 2006"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Aktuell lista"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "sr.se"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "31 January 2010"}]}, {"name": "as of", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2012"}, {"name": "2", "value": "October"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Anni-Frid Lyngstad"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.allmusic.com/album/somethings-going-on-mw0000193886"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Something's Going On \u2013 Frida {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic"}, {"name": "website", "value": "AllMusic"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-03-05"}]}, {"name": "cite magazine", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60446/frida-admits-longing-for-abba-reunion"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Frida Admits Longing For ABBA Reunion"}, {"name": "magazine", "value": "Billboard"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "29 December 2016"}]}, {"name": "frac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Palm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "470"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "A Dancing Queen Extends Her Reign"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/arts/music/agnetha-faltskog-of-abba-back-with-a-new-album.html"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "17 February 2014"}, {"name": "newspaper", "value": "The New York Times"}, {"name": "date", "value": "5 May 2013"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Itzkoff, Dave"}]}], "id": 25}, {"title": "Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus", "paragraphs": "{{Main|1=Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus|2=Benny Andersson}}\nIn October 1984, Ulvaeus and Andersson together with lyricist [[Tim Rice]] released the musical concept double-album ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''.

The former reached number-one in Australia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland; number-two in Austria, France and New Zealand, and number-three in Canada, Norway, Sweden and the US. In May 1986, the musical premiered in London's West End, and ran for almost three years. ''Chess'' also opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged ''Chess p\u00e5 svenska'' (''Chess in Swedish'') in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers ''\"Han \u00e4r en man, han \u00e4r ett barn\"'' (\"He's a Man, He's a Child\") and ''\"Gl\u00f6m mig om du kan\"'' (\"Forget Me If You Can\").

The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]] in 1985 and 1987. In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his own label, Mono Music, called \"''[[Klinga mina klockor]]''\" (\"Ring My Bells\"), containing material inspired by Swedish folk music&nbsp;\u2013 and followed it with a second album titled ''[[November 1989 (album)|November 1989]]''.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet [[Ainbusk|Ainbusk Singers]], giving them two hits: \"Lassie\" and \"''\u00c4lska mig''\" (\"Love me\"), and later produced ''[[Shapes (album)|Shapes]]'', an English-language album by group's [[Josefin Nilsson]] with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to [[Roy Andersson]]'s ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''). In 2001, Andersson formed his own band, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (BAO), which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio [[Svensktoppen]] charts; the song ''\"Du \u00e4r min man\"'' (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by [[Helen Sj\u00f6holm]], spent 278 weeks there between 2004 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815042720/http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872|archivedate=15 August 2007|date=2 July 2006|title=Aktuell lista |publisher=sr.se |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> Andersson released his third album [[BAO 3]] in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sj\u00f6holm and [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]], as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000.\n\n[[File:2015-12-12-030 Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus (29193749840) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus lecturing in Stockholm, 2015]] Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of the Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of [[V\u00e4stervik]], singing their 1966 hit \"Marianne\".\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical ''[[Mamma Mia! (musical)|Mamma Mia!]]'', alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres. They were also involved in the production of the successful film version of the musical, which opened in July 2008. Andersson produced the soundtrack utilising many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours. Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a \"fisherman\" piano player in the \"Dancing Queen\" scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing a [[lyre]] during the closing credits.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently they wrote seven songs for Andersson's 2011 BAO album ''O Klang Och Jubeltid'', performed as usual by vocalists Sj\u00f6holm, K\u00f6rberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO (now renamed the Benny Andersson Band) released their first international album, ''The Story of a Heart''. The album was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English; the new title song premiered on BBC2's ''Ken Bruce Show''. A Swedish-language version of the title track, ''\"Sommaren Du Fick\"'' (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm. In May 2009, Andersson released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel ''Hotel Rival'', titled \"[[2nd Best to None]]\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work.\n\nIn 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]], titled ''\"Jag vill bli gammal\"'' (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show ''\"Your Days Are Numbered\"'', which was never recorded and released, but was performed on television. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album ''[[Winter Symphony]]''. New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song ''\"Innan Gryningen\"'' (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for [[Barbara Dickson]] (performed live, but not yet recorded and released). In 2007, they wrote the song ''\"Han som har vunnit allt\"'' (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor/singer [[Anders Ekborg]].\n\nUlvaeus also wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Andersson's solo albums:  \"After the Rain\" (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], for her Andersson tribute album ''I Let the Music Speak'', and \"I Walk with You Mama\" (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989). [[Barbara Dickson]] recorded (but not yet released) a Bj\u00f6rn & Benny song entitled \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the track was eventually released by Australian ''Mamma Mia!'' musical star [[Anne Wood]] on her album of ABBA covers, ''[[Divine Discontent]]''. {{as of|2012|October|}}, Ulvaeus has mentioned writing new material with Andersson for a BAO Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO 'box'). Andersson (together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson) composed music for a Swedish language obscure musical, \"Hj\u00e4lp S\u00f6kes\" (\"Help Wanted\"), which premiered In February 2013.

The single \"[[If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind]]\" (a cover of the song recorded by [[Cilla Black]]) became F\u00e4ltskog's biggest solo hit in the UK, reaching number 11, while peaking at number-two in her native Sweden. A second single, \"[[When You Walk in the Room]]\", was released but met with less success. In January 2007, F\u00e4ltskog sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy K\u00f6rberg at the after party for the final performance of the musical, ''Mamma Mia!'', in Stockholm, at which Andersson and Ulvaeus were also present.\n\nIn May 2013, F\u00e4ltskog released a solo album entitled ''[[A (Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog album)|A]]'' through [[Universal Music Group|Universal International]].

She also revealed that she completed singing lessons prior to recording the album, as she felt her throat was \"a bit rusty\". F\u00e4ltskog stated that she would not be undertaking any tours or live performances in support of the album, explaining: \"I'm not that young anymore.
