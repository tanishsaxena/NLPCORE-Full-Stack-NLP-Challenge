Ancient Aethiopia was seen as a region that \u201cmany ancient writers liken to ancient India.\u201d Homer places Aethiopia at the world's edge, somewhere vaguely in Asia.\n\nIn her 1992 article ''The Black Andromeda,'' Prof. Elizabeth McGrath discusses the idea of Andromeda being black based on Ovid's writings.<ref name=\"jstor751417\" /> Likewise, Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote about the black Andromeda in a 2014 article for [[The Root (magazine)|''The Root'' magazine]].

In his first work, the ''Heroides'' or ''Epistulae Heroidum'' (Epistles of the Heroines), Ovid uses the Latin word ''\"fuscae\"'' to describe Andromeda, with \u201cfusca\u201d being used to describe the colour black or brown. Later in the same work, Ovid has Sappho explain to Phaon: \"though I'm not pure white, Cepheus's dark/Andromeda/charmed Perseus with her native colour. White doves often choose mates of different hue and the parrot loves the black turtle dove.\" In his ''Ars Amatoria'' (The Art of Love), Ovid mentions that Perseus finds Andromeda among \"the black Indians.\" In this account Perseus initially mistakes her for a statue of marble, which might suggest she was light-skinned, but since statues in Ovid's time were commonly painted to look like living people, her skin tone could have been of any color.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982089362|title=Gods in color : polychromy in the ancient world|others=Brinkmann, Vinzenz,, Dreyfus, Ren\u00e9e,, Koch-Brinkmann, Ulrike,, Legion of Honor (San Francisco, Calif.),|isbn=978-3-7913-5707-2|location=San Francisco|oclc=982089362}}</ref> It is worth noting that aside from [[Philodemus]], who (in [[Greek Anthology]]) also stated that Andromeda was an Indian,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg7000.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.132 Greek Anthology, B5.132]</ref> Ovid was the only ancient author to have outright described Andromeda as being dark skinned.\n\nIn his Histories, Herodotus described Andromeda as being a Persian Princess, indicating that she was Iranian in origin as she and her husband Perseus were seen as the progenitors of the Persians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/7B*.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Herodotus \u2014 Book VII: Chapters 57\u2011137|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIsidore mentions in ''The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville'' that the story of Andromeda was said to have taken place in the prehistoric city of Joppa, now [[Jaffa]] in modern Israel. He reports a rock displayed there which still retains traces of the chains of Andromeda, in the shape of a sea-monster larger than an elephant. Here, Isidore refers to Andromeda as being a Palestinian (at the time meaning [[Philistine]]{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}) Princess.\n\nIn Heliodorus\u2019 tale, the ''Aethiopica'', set in the kingdom Mero\u00eb (modern Sudan), Queen Persinna gives birth to her daughter, Chariclea who, despite having black parents, was born with white skin. In a letter to Chariclea, Persinna attributes her daughter's anomalous colour to the fact that when Persinna became pregnant with her, she was gazing up at a picture of the white-skinned Andromeda. ''\u201c[T]hou wert born white, which colour is strange among the Ethiopians.

Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is mentioned only as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.\n* Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character was played by [[Rosamund Pike]] in the sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', the second of a planned [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|trilogy]]. In the end of the sequel, Perseus and Andromeda begin a relationship.\n* In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' the character, [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]], represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.\n* Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' as a new student of \"Prometheus Academy\" which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend.\n*The Greek form of Andromeda is present in the show [[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]], with a character originally named Ronald Wilkerson who changed his name to Titus Andromedon.\n\n===In novels===\n* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'' series, there are a few references to Andromeda.

Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is mentioned only as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.\n* Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]].
