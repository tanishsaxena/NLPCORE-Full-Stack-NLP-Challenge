The organization has been designated as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[European Union]], the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and various other countries (see [[#Designation as a terrorist group|below]]). Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries, including the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], the [[September 11 attacks]], and the [[2002 Bali bombings]].\n\nThe United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the \"[[War on Terror]]\", which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies. The deaths of key leaders, including that of [[death of Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]], have led al-Qaeda's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and ''[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf]]'' operators.

oppression:\n# Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.\n# Incite local resistance to occupying forces.\n# Expand the conflict to neighboring countries, and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.\n# Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], but which did not have the same effect with the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]].\n# The US economy will finally collapse by the year 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places. This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability. This will lead to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda, and a [[Wahhabi]] [[Caliphate]] will then be installed across the world.\n\nAtwan noted that, while the plan is unrealistic, \"it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|downfall of the Soviet Union]].\"<ref name=Atwan/>\n\nAccording to [[Fouad Hussein]], a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020. These phases include:<ref>{{cite news|last1=Musharbash|first1=Yassir|title=The Future of Terrorism: What al-Qaida Really Wants|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html|accessdate=January 15, 2015|work=Der Spiegel|date=August 12, 2005}}</ref>\n# \"The Awakening.\" This phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003. The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack on US soil that kills many civilians.\n# \"Opening Eyes.\" This phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006. The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al-Qaeda group into a movement. Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.\n# \"Arising and Standing up\", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010. In this phase, al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria. Hussein believed that other countries in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] were also in danger.\n# Al-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula. The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and [[cyberterrorism]], targeting the US economy and military infrastructure.\n# The declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016.

A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations. One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.\n\nResearch suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting between leaders of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden took place.

The [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.\n\nIn the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered.

During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.\n\nA key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.</ref> Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport.

began to prepare its [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. The US offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).\n\nThe [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks.

As a result of the US [[special forces]] and [[close air support|air support]] for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted.

former allies of ISIL such as the [[al-Nusra Front]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/isis-spokesman-declares-caliphate-rebrands-group-as-islamic-state.html|title=ISIS
