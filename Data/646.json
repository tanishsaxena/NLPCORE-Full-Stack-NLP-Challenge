Railways connect it with the mineral regions of north-central Alabama.\n\nAfter the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the [[Cahaba River]], which is about {{convert|194|mi}} long<ref name=NHD/> and joins the Alabama River about {{convert|10|mi}} below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from [[Rome, Georgia]], to about {{convert|117|mi}} above [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]] (about {{convert|102|mi}} below Rome and {{convert|26|mi}} below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa.

The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.\n\nThe river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways.\n\nDocumented by Europeans first in 1712,{{fact|date=June 2019}} the Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] before their [[Indian Removal|removal]] by United States forces to the [[Indian Territory]] in the 1830s.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.caria.org/navigation.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archived copy"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2010-05-09"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110725141115/http://www.caria.org/navigation.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "2011-07-25"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "50"}, {"name": "2", "value": "to"}, {"name": "3", "value": "200"}, {"name": "4", "value": "yd"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3"}, {"name": "2", "value": "to"}, {"name": "3", "value": "40"}, {"name": "4", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "5", "value": "0"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "318.5"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120329155652/http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2012-03-29"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "420"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Berney"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Saffold"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Handbook Of Alabama: A Complete Index To The State"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Nabu Press"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-1-1792-5964-2"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "194"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "10"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "117"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "102"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "26"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "265"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "60"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "adj", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "fact", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2019"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Edmund Pettus Bridge", "paragraphs": "The [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] crosses the Alabama River near [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]].
