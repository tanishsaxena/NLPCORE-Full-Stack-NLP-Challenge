He survived that ordeal, but succumbed to tropical illness a dozen years later while serving aboard {{HMS|Weymouth|1693|6}} off West Africa.\n\nSelkirk was an unruly youth, and joined [[buccaneer]]ing voyages to the South Pacific during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. One such expedition was on ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', captained by Thomas Stradling under the overall command of [[William Dampier]]. Stradling's ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there.\n\nBy the time he was eventually rescued by English privateer [[Woodes Rogers]], in company with Dampier, Selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island. His story of survival was widely publicised after his return to England, becoming a source of inspiration for writer [[Daniel Defoe]]'s fictional character [[Robinson Crusoe]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use British English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "Infobox person\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Alexander Selkirk"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alexander Selkirk Statue.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "Bronze statue of Selkirk located in a stone alcove"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Clad in goatskins, Selkirk awaits rescue in a sculpture by&nbsp;[[Thomas Stuart Burnett]] (1885)"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "1676"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Lower Largo]], [[Fife]], Scotland"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "13 December 1721 (aged 45)"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Cape Coast]], [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]"}, {"name": "nationality", "value": "Scottish and British (after [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]])"}, {"name": "parents", "value": "John Selcraig, Euphan Mackie"}, {"name": "known_for", "value": "Inspiring ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''"}, {"name": "occupation", "value": "Sailor"}]}, {"name": "HMS", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Weymouth"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1693"}, {"name": "3", "value": "6"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Early life and privateering", "paragraphs": "Alexander Selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in [[Lower Largo]], [[Fife]], Scotland, born in 1676.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=18\u201319}} In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition.

As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying helpless and unable to move for about a day. His prey had cushioned his fall, probably sparing him a broken back.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nChildhood lessons learned from his father, a tanner, now served him well.

Unfortunately for Selkirk, both were Spanish. As a Scotsman and a privateer, he would have faced a grim fate if captured and therefore did his best to hide himself. Once, he was spotted and chased by a group of Spanish sailors from one of the ships. His pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to notice him.
