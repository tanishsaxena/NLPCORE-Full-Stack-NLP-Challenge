The Articles of Confederation [[Coming into force|came into force]] on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the states. The  weak [[central government]] established by the Articles received only those powers which the [[Thirteen Colonies|former colonies]] had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\">Morison p. 279</ref>\n\nThe document provided clearly written rules for how the states' \"league of friendship\" would be organized. During the ratification process, the Congress looked to the Articles for guidance as it conducted business, directing the [[American Revolutionary War|war effort]], conducting diplomacy with foreign nations, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into effect, as ratification did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but most Americans continued to call it the ''Continental Congress'', since its organization remained the same.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\"/>\n\nAs the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]], some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling nation began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. It was quickly agreed that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Martin|title=Why did the Articles of Confederation fail?|publisher=About Education|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/governmentandpolitics/f/articles_of_confederation_fails.htm|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Rodgers| first = Paul| title = United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ&pg=PA109| year = 2011| publisher = McFarland| isbn = 978-0-7864-6017-5| page = 109 }}</ref> The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the [[President of the United States|President]]), courts, and taxing powers.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "First constitution of the United States"}]}, {"name": "pp", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2019"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox document\n", "values": [{"name": "document_name", "value": "{{nowrap|Articles of Confederation}}"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Articles page1.jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "Page I of the Articles of Confederation"}, {"name": "date_created", "value": "November 15, 1777"}, {"name": "date_ratified", "value": "March 1, 1781"}, {"name": "location_of_document", "value": "[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]"}, {"name": "writer", "value": "[[Continental Congress]]"}, {"name": "signers", "value": "Continental Congress"}, {"name": "purpose", "value": "First constitution for the United States; replaced by the current [[United States Constitution]] on March 4, 1789"}, {"name": "wikisource", "value": "Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Articles of Confederation"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Jensen"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Merrill"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774\u20131781"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1959"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Wisconsin Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-299-00204-6"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "xi, 184"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Kelley"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Martin"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Why did the Articles of Confederation fail?"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "About Education"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://americanhistory.about.com/od/governmentandpolitics/f/articles_of_confederation_fails.htm"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "March 2, 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Rodgers"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Paul"}, {"name": "title", "value": "United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ&pg=PA109"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "McFarland"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-7864-6017-5"}, {"name": "page", "value": "109"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Background and context", "paragraphs": "The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 and [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed [[Albany Plan]], an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen; others would weaken, especially in the degree of loyalty (or lack thereof) owed the Crown. [[Boston Tea Party|Civil disobedience]] resulted in coercive and quelling measures, such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the [[Intolerable Acts]] in the English Parliament, and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|armed skirmishes]] which resulted in dissidents being [[Proclamation of Rebellion|proclaimed rebels]]. These actions eroded the number of Crown Loyalists ([[Tory|Tories]]) among the colonials and, together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the Patriot leaders, caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the [[Second Continental Congress]] began acting as the [[provisional government]].\n\nIt was an era of constitution writing\u2014most states were busy at the task\u2014and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution; a \"rulebook\" for how the new nation should function.

In early 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] argued in the closing pages of the first edition of ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that the \"custom of nations\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \"manifesto\" which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \"[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Paine| first = Thomas| editor-last = Foner| editor-first = Eric| editor-link = Eric Foner| title = Paine: Collected Writings| publisher = The Library of America |   isbn = 978-1-4286-2200-5| pages = 45\u20136| chapter = Common Sense| date = January 14, 1776 }} (Collection published 1995.)</ref>\n\nBeyond improving their existing [[Continental Association|association]], the records of the [[Second Continental Congress]] show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] introduced [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve \"to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances\" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]], a [[Model Treaty|model treaty]], and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established \"a firm league\" among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.<ref>{{Cite journal |author-link= David Armitage (historian) |first= David |last=  Armitage |url= http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full |title= The Declaration of Independence in World Context |publisher= [[Organization of American Historians]] |journal= Magazine of History |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 61\u201366 |year= 2004 |doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.61}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Wood"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Gordon S."}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Creation of the American Republic: 1776\u20131787"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood"}, {"name": "url-access", "value": "registration"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1969"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of North Carolina Press"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood/page/354 354\u201355]"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Paine"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Thomas"}, {"name": "editor-last", "value": "Foner"}, {"name": "editor-first", "value": "Eric"}, {"name": "editor-link", "value": "Eric Foner"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Paine: Collected Writings"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "The Library of America"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-1-4286-2200-5"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "45\u20136"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Common Sense"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 14, 1776"}]}, {"name": "Cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "author-link", "value": "David Armitage (historian)"}, {"name": "first", "value": "David"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Armitage"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Declaration of Independence in World Context"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Organization of American Historians]]"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Magazine of History"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "18"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "3"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "61\u201366"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1093/maghis/18.3.61"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Drafting", "paragraphs": "[[File:Articles of Confederation 13c 1977 issue.JPG|thumb|right|upright=.90|alt=Historical 13-cent postage stamp commemorating the Articles of Confederation 200th anniversary|1977 13-cent U.S. [[Postage stamp]] commemorating the Articles of Confederation bicentennial; the draft was completed on November 15, 1777]]\nOn June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.

The document also stipulates that its provisions \"shall be inviolably observed by every state\" and that \"[[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]]\". \n\nSummary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles:\n# Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: \"The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'\"\n# Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government: \"Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.\"\n# Declares the purpose of the confederation: \"The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.\"\n# Elaborates upon the intent \"to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,\" and to establish [[Equality before the law|equal treatment]] and [[freedom of movement]] for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding \"[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.\" All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.\n# Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the \"United States in Congress Assembled\") to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures. No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years.\n# Only the central government may declare war, or conduct foreign political or commercial relations. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. No states may form any sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations [[Model Treaty|already proposed]]. No state may wage war without permission of Congress, unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-trained, disciplined, and equipped [[Militia (United States)|militia]].\n# Whenever an army is raised for common defense, the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below.\n# Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each.\n# Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled. \n#* Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] (documents authorizing [[privateer]]s) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish [[Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture|courts for appeals in all cases of captures]], but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.\n#* The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them. Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial. The court's decision is final.\n#* Congress shall regulate the [[post office]]s; appoint officers in the military; and regulate the armed forces.\n#* The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three-year term of the Congress.\n#* Congress may request requisitions (demands for payments or supplies) from the states in proportion with their population, or take credit.\n#* Congress may not declare war, enter into treaties and alliances, appropriate money, or appoint a [[commander in chief]] without nine states assented. Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months.\n# When Congress is in recess, any of the powers of Congress may be executed by \"The committee of the states, or any nine of them\", except for those powers of Congress which require nine states ''in'' Congress to execute.\n# If Canada (referring to the British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]]) accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp |title= Articles of Confederation}}</ref> No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states.\n#Affirms that the Confederation will honor all [[Engagements Clause#The precursor in the Articles of Confederation|bills of credit incurred, monies borrowed, and debts contracted by Congress]] before the existence of the Articles.\n# Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual, and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Articles of Confederation"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Congress under the Articles", "paragraphs": "\n===The army===\nUnder the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the [[Continental Army]], but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding.

Phelps pp. 165\u2013166. Phelps wrote:\n:\"It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.\"</ref>}}\n\nThe Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u201384. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.<ref>Puls pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Knox wrote:\n\n{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, \"A hoop to the barrel\" or \"Cement to the Union\".<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\">Puls p. 177</ref>}}\n\nAs Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, \"As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.\"<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\" />\n\nOnce the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small [[First American Regiment|national force]] was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lodge| first = Henry Cabot| title = George Washington, Vol. I| url = https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98| volume = I| year = 1893 }}</ref>\n\nThe Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Keith L. |last= Dougherty |title= An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775\u20131783 |journal= Social Science History |date=  Spring 2009 |volume= 33 |issue= 1 |pages= 47\u201374 |doi=10.1215/01455532-2008-015}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Confederation Period#Foreign affairs}}\nThe 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a [[quorum]] so that it could be ratified. Afterward, the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time, causing difficulties in raising a [[quorum]]. The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists, including George Washington. Many of the most prominent national leaders, such as Washington, [[John Adams]], [[John Hancock]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]], retired from public life, served as foreign delegates, or held office in state governments; and for the general public, local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory. This served to exacerbate Congress's impotence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferling|first1=John|title=A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic|url=https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl/page/255 255\u2013259]}}</ref>\n\nInherent weaknesses in the confederation's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1786, [[Thomas Jefferson]], concerned over the failure of Congress to fund an American naval force to confront the [[Barbary pirates]], wrote in a [[Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the Pyratical states of Barbary|diplomatic correspondence]] to [[James Monroe]] that, \"It will be said there is no money in the treasury.

In this treaty, which was never ratified, the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil \u2014 forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795, after the federal Constitution came into force.\n\n===Taxation and commerce===\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781\u20131789| url = https://archive.org/details/newnation03morrgoog| year = 1950| publisher = Northeastern University Press| isbn = 978-0-930350-14-7| pages = 177\u2013233 }}</ref>\n\nCongress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, \"that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.\"<ref>Stahr p. 105</ref> Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45&nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were \"the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.\"<ref>Stahr p. 107</ref> He argued that Americans should avoid having it said \"that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent\" or that \"her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.\"<ref>Stahr pp. 107\u2013108</ref> The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.\n\nCongress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.\n\n===Accomplishments===\n{{details|Admission to the Union#Articles of Confederation}}\n{{more footnotes|section|date=January 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the [[admission to the Union|admission of new states]] and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for [[public domain (land)|public use]]. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and it established the precedent by which the national (later, federal) government would be sovereign and expand westward\u2014as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sat\u014d| first=Sh\u014dsuke| url=https://books.google.com/?id=PY0VAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#v=onepage&q&f=false| title=History of the land question in the United States| publisher=Isaac Friedenwald, for [[Johns Hopkins University]]| location=Baltimore, Maryland| date=1886| page=352|orig-year=Digitized 2008| accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]].  Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866|Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cession|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]], eventually became the states of: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states.\n\nNo new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] (referred to as \"Canada\" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin),  [[Kentucky]], and [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]] to the Union were considered, but none were approved.\n\n===Presidents of Congress===\n{{Further|President of the Continental Congress}}\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the presiding officer of Congress\u2014referred to in many official records as ''President of the United States in Congress Assembled''\u2014chaired the [[Committee of the States]] when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the later [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774\u20131781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = 178\u2013179 }}</ref>\n\nThere were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles.

However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u201384.

A very small [[First American Regiment|national force]] was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lodge| first = Henry Cabot| title = George Washington, Vol. I| url = https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98| volume = I| year = 1893 }}</ref>\n\nThe Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis.

Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866|Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cession|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states.

Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again.

Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.\n\nOn July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also were unable to sign that day, since their delegations were absent.\n\nAfter the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.\n\nThe other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation.

At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a \"Grand Convention.\" Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:\n\n{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.<ref>McDonald pg. 276</ref>}}\n\nIn May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.\n\nHistorian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:\n\n{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the \"consolidated government\" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a \"splendid empire\" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ketcham| first = Ralph| title = Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&pg=PA381| year = 1990| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield| isbn = 978-0-945612-19-3| page = 383 }}</ref>}}\n\nHistorians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.\n\nRakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures \"stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.\"<ref>Rakove 1988 p. 230</ref> The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new \"merchant state,\" much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.<ref>Hendrickson p. 154</ref>\n\n===Legitimacy of closing down===\nPolitical scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that \"the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.\"<ref>Hendrickson p. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nAccording to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: \n\n<blockquote>[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:\n\n<blockquote>The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.</blockquote>\n\nThe apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot: \"As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.\"  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.<ref name=Maier>Maier, Pauline.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-DvolFMBVRgC&pg=PA62 Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787\u20131788]'', p. 62 (Simon and Schuster, 2011).</ref>  Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.<ref name=Maier />\n\nModern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus \"other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule\".<ref>Martin, Francisco.

The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be \"unadvisable\" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so \"under the Articles of Confederation\" only, but not \"under the Constitution\".<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kesavan| first1=Vasan| title=When Did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law| journal=Notre Dame Law Review|date=December 1, 2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=70\u201371|url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol78/iss1/3 |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that \"the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.\"<ref>Hendrickson p. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nAccording to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: \n\n<blockquote>[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:\n\n<blockquote>The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.</blockquote>\n\nThe apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot: \"As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.\"  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.<ref name=Maier>Maier, Pauline.
