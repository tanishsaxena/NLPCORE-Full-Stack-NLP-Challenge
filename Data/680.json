[[Takeda Nobuhiro]] killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain.

The [[Tokugawa bakufu]] (feudal government) granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive.

The most important was [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669\u20131672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the [[Menashi-Kunashir Battle]] in 1789.\n\nFrom 1799 to 1806, the shogunate took direct control of southern Hokkaid\u014d. Ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten year terms of service, and were enticed with rewards of food and clothing if they agreed to drop their native language and culture and become Japanese. Ainu women were separated from their husbands and forcibly married to Japanese merchants and fishermen, who were told that a taboo forbid them from bringing their wives to Hokkaid\u014d. Women were often tortured if they resisted rape by their new Japanese husbands, and frequently ran away into the mountains. These policies of family separation and forcible assimilation, combined with the impact of smallpox, caused the Ainu population to drop significantly in the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewallen |title=The fabric of indigeneity : Ainu identity, gender, and settler colonialism in Japan |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |isbn=0826357369 |pages=131\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n=== Meiji Restoration and later ===\nIn the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |first=Dinah |last=Shelton |volume=2 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |year=2005}}</ref> In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaid\u014d, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Howell |chapter=The Meiji State and the Logic of Ainu 'Protection' |title=New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan |editor-first=Helen |editor-last=Hardacre |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1997 |page=614 |isbn=978-9-00410-735-9}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture.

The [[Tokugawa bakufu]] (feudal government) granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive.

The most important was [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669\u20131672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the [[Menashi-Kunashir Battle]] in 1789.\n\nFrom 1799 to 1806, the shogunate took direct control of southern Hokkaid\u014d. Ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten year terms of service, and were enticed with rewards of food and clothing if they agreed to drop their native language and culture and become Japanese. Ainu women were separated from their husbands and forcibly married to Japanese merchants and fishermen, who were told that a taboo forbid them from bringing their wives to Hokkaid\u014d. Women were often tortured if they resisted rape by their new Japanese husbands, and frequently ran away into the mountains. These policies of family separation and forcible assimilation, combined with the impact of smallpox, caused the Ainu population to drop significantly in the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewallen |title=The fabric of indigeneity : Ainu identity, gender, and settler colonialism in Japan |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |isbn=0826357369 |pages=131\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Sato"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Takehiro"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Journal of Human Genetics"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "52"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "7"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "618\u2013627"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "17568987"}, {"name": "display-authors", "value": "etal"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Leeming"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "David"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Dictionary of Asian Mythology"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford University Press"}, {"name": "page", "value": "10"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html"}, {"name": "script-title", "value": "ja:\u7b2c59\u56de \u4ea4\u6613\u306e\u6c11\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc \u2166 \u5143\u3068\u306e\u6226\u3044"}, {"name": "language", "value": "Japanese"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Asahikawa, Hokkaido|Asahikawa City]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 2, 2010"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "March 2, 2011"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110721151652/http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "July 21, 2011"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.ainu-assn.or.jp/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "\u516c\u76ca\u793e\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba \u5317\u6d77\u9053\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u5354\u4f1a"}, {"name": "website", "value": "\u516c\u76ca\u793e\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u5354\u4f1a"}, {"name": "language", "value": "ja"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2019-08-07"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "editor-last", "value": "Weiner"}, {"name": "editor-first", "value": "M."}, {"name": "year", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Japan's Minorities: The Illusion of Homogeneity"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Routledge"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-41515-218-1"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA Online]]"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[PBS]]"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Island of the Spirits \u2013 Origins of the Ainu"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "May 8, 2008"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion, 1590\u20131800"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Walker"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Brett"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of California Press"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Berkeley"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "49\u201356, 61\u201371, 172\u2013176"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-52022-736-1"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Lewallen"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The fabric of indigeneity : Ainu identity, gender, and settler colonialism in Japan"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of New Mexico Press"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Albuquerque"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0826357369"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "131\u2013142"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": " Meiji Restoration and later ", "paragraphs": "In the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |first=Dinah |last=Shelton |volume=2 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |year=2005}}</ref> In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaid\u014d, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Howell |chapter=The Meiji State and the Logic of Ainu 'Protection' |title=New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan |editor-first=Helen |editor-last=Hardacre |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1997 |page=614 |isbn=978-9-00410-735-9}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture.

Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them.</blockquote>Although Brace (1990) rejected a Caucasoid origin for the Jomon people and said that the J\u014dmon share many physical characteristics with Caucasians but are a separate genetic stock, a craniometric study by Brace et al. 2001 suggests not only morphological affinities to [[Caucasoid]]s, but also possible genetic ties at one time (Pleistocene). The study results show a closer morphological relation between Ainu (including other J\u014dmon remnants) and [[West Asian]]s rather than between Ainu and [[East Asian]]s.

Kotan were located in [[river basins]] and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which [[salmon]] went upstream.

In the early modern times, the Ainu people were [[forced labor|forced to labor]] at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n''Cise'' or ''cisey'' (houses) in a kotan were made of [[cogon|cogon grass]], [[bamboo|bamboo grass]], [[bark (botany)|bark]], etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the \"rorun-puyar,\" a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called ''shiso'') . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called ''harkiso''). The house had a platform for valuables called ''iyoykir'' behind the shiso. The Ainu placed ''sintoko'' (hokai) and ''ikayop'' (quivers) there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOutbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ''ashinru'' and for women called ''menokoru'', a ''pu'' (storehouse) for food, a \"heper set\" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (''nusasan'') faced the east side of the house (''rorunpuyar'').

Kotan were located in [[river basins]] and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which [[salmon]] went upstream. A village consisted basically of a [[Patrilineality|paternal]] [[clan]]. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were [[forced labor|forced to labor]] at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n''Cise'' or ''cisey'' (houses) in a kotan were made of [[cogon|cogon grass]], [[bamboo|bamboo grass]], [[bark (botany)|bark]], etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the \"rorun-puyar,\" a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called ''shiso'') . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called ''harkiso''). The house had a platform for valuables called ''iyoykir'' behind the shiso. The Ainu placed ''sintoko'' (hokai) and ''ikayop'' (quivers) there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOutbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ''ashinru'' and for women called ''menokoru'', a ''pu'' (storehouse) for food, a \"heper set\" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (''nusasan'') faced the east side of the house (''rorunpuyar'').

The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Levin |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 |title=Essential Commodities and Racial Justice: Using Constitutional Protection of Japan's Indigenous Ainu People to Inform Understandings of the United States and Japan |journal=New York University Journal of International Law and Politics |volume=33 |pages=445\u2013446 |year=2001}}</ref> The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to [[Nibutani]] village,<ref name=\"MarkLevin\">{{cite journal |ssrn=1635447 |first=Mark |last=Levin |year=1999 |title=Kayano et al. v.
