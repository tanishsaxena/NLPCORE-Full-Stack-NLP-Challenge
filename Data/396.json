The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan on CIA's Worldfactbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> The government has largely completed [[privatization]] of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises.
