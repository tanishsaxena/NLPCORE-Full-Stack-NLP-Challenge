His attention, by his own account, was first drawn to history by the publication (before 1139) of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth's]] [[Historia Regum Britanniae]], and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name, and which largely depends on Geoffrey's work, with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the [[Historia Regum Britanniae]], but no trace of such a work is extant.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=258}}\n\nAlfred of Beverley's chronicle is entitled ''Aluredi Beverlacensis Annales sive Historia de gestis Regum Britanni\u00e6 libris ix. ad annum 1129''. It is largely devoted to the fabulous history of Britain, and is mainly borrowed from [[Venerable Bede|Bede]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Symeon of Durham]], when Geoffrey of Monmouth is not laid under contribution. Alfred quotes occasionally from [[Suetonius]], [[Orosius]], and [[Nennius]], and names many Roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for references to Britain. The chronicle is of no real use to the historical student, since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well-known earlier authorities.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=258}}\n\nAccording to Sidney Lee (1885) the best manuscript of Alfred's ''Annales'' was among the Hengwrt MSS. belonging to W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., of Peniarth, Merionethshire, and had not been printed. Hearne printed the \u2018Annales\u2019 in 1716 from an inferior Bodleian MS. (Rawl.
