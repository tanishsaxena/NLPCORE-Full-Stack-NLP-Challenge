Upon his death, Nepociano, a family member of undetermined relation, attempted to usurp the crown in place of the future Ramiro I.\n\nDuring his reign, which covered a span of 51 years, Alfonso discovered the supposed tomb of [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle Santiago]] in the town of Compostela, which later became known as the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. He was the son of [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I]] and Munia, a [[Basque people|Basque]] woman captured and brought back to Asturias by the former following a military campaign.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2013"}]}, {"name": "Refimprove", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2017"}]}, {"name": "Expand Spanish", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Alfonso II de Asturias"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 2012"}]}, {"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "760"}]}, {"name": "lang-es", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "el Casto"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " Early life ", "paragraphs": "He was born in [[Oviedo]] in 759 or 760.

Also during Alfonso's reign was the alleged resting-place of St. James revealed.
