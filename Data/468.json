Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based [[creole language|creoles]] are used in many countries around the world, including much of [[West Africa]] and parts of [[Southeast Asia]]. ASL is also widely learned as a [[second language]], serving as a [[lingua franca]]. ASL is most closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a [[creole language]] of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as [[agglutination|agglutinative morphology]].\n\nASL originated in the early 19th century in the [[American School for the Deaf]] (ASD) in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]], from a situation of [[language contact]]. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of [[child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]]. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of [[oral language]] to sign language. That is compounded by the fact that ASL is often [[interlinear gloss|glossed]] in English for lack of a standard writing system.\n\nASL signs have a number of [[phoneme|phonemic]] components, such as movement of the face, the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form of [[mime|pantomime]] although [[iconicity]] plays a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English [[loan word]]s are often borrowed through [[fingerspelling]], although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]]. Many linguists believe ASL to be a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO) language. However, there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ASL"}]}, {"name": "redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Canadian Sign Language"}, {"name": "2", "value": "French Canadian Sign Language"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Quebec Sign Language"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sign language used predominately in the United States"}]}, {"name": "Infobox language\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "American Sign Language"}, {"name": "nativename", "value": "''Langue des signes am\u00e9ricaine'' (in the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec)"}, {"name": "image", "value": "[[File:American Sign Language ASL.svg|250px|center]]"}, {"name": "region", "value": "English-speaking [[North America]]"}, {"name": "states", "value": "[[United States]], [[Canada]]"}, {"name": "speakers", "value": "250,000\u2013500,000 in the United States"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1972"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "<ref name=\"mitchell\"/>{{rp|26}}"}, {"name": "speakers2", "value": "[[second language|L2]] users: Used as L2 by many hearing people and by [[Hawaii Sign Language]] speakers."}, {"name": "familycolor", "value": "sign"}, {"name": "fam1", "value": "[[French Sign Language family|French Sign]]-based (possibly a [[creole language|creole]] with [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]])"}, {"name": "dia1", "value": "[[Black American Sign Language|Black American Sign]]"}, {"name": "dia2", "value": "[[Bolivian Sign Language|Bolivian Sign]]"}, {"name": "dia3", "value": "[[Costa Rican Sign Language|Costa Rican Sign]]"}, {"name": "dia4", "value": "[[Ghanaian Sign Language|Ghanaian Sign]]"}, {"name": "dia5", "value": "[[Nigerian Sign Language|Nigerian Sign]]"}, {"name": "dia6", "value": "[[Francophone African Sign Language|Francophone African Sign]]"}, {"name": "dia7", "value": "[[Quebec Sign Language|Qu\u00e9bec Sign]]"}, {"name": "script", "value": "None are widely accepted <br /> [[si5s]] (ASLwrite), [[ASL-phabet]], [[Stokoe notation]], [[SignWriting]]"}, {"name": "nation", "value": "none"}, {"name": "minority", "value": "[[Ontario]] only in domains of: legislation, education and judiciary proceedings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID=1619&isCurrent=false&BillStagePrintId=|title=Bill 213: An Act to recognize sign language as an official language in Ontario|author=Province of Ontario|date=2007}}</ref><br />40 US states recognize ASL to varying degrees, from a foreign language for school credits to the official language of that state's deaf population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncssfl.org/links/ASL.pdf|title=States that Recognize American Sign Language as a Foreign Language|author=Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412063352/http://www.ncssfl.org/links/ASL.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2015}}</ref>"}, {"name": "iso3", "value": "ase"}, {"name": "glotto", "value": "asli1244"}, {"name": "glottoname", "value": "ASL family"}, {"name": "glottorefname", "value": "ASLic"}, {"name": "glotto2", "value": "amer1248"}, {"name": "glottoname2", "value": "ASL proper"}, {"name": "glottorefname2", "value": "American Sign Language"}, {"name": "map", "value": "ASL map (world).png"}, {"name": "mapcaption", "value": "{{legend|#FF7D81|Areas where ASL or a dialect/derivative thereof is the national sign language}}{{legend|#FFB4B6|Areas where ASL is in significant use alongside another sign language}}"}]}, {"name": "rp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "26"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID=1619&isCurrent=false&BillStagePrintId="}, {"name": "title", "value": "Bill 213: An Act to recognize sign language as an official language in Ontario"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Province of Ontario"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2007"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ncssfl.org/links/ASL.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "States that Recognize American Sign Language as a Foreign Language"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "23 July 2015"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150412063352/http://www.ncssfl.org/links/ASL.pdf"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "12 April 2015"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#FF7D81"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Areas where ASL or a dialect/derivative thereof is the national sign language"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#FFB4B6"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Areas where ASL is in significant use alongside another sign language"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Classification", "paragraphs": "[[File:American Sign Language demo -

Many people in high school and colleges desire to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many did not consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture, and they interact very differently when they talk. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating.
