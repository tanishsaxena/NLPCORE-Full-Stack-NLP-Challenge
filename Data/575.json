In particular, spelling in English only slowly became fixed.

(Latin: What is truth?), namely, ''Est vir qui adest'' (Latin: It is the man who is here). The origins of these are not documented.\n\nLatin continued to influence letter values (such as I = J, U = V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be \"perfect\" if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the [[Jesuits]]: ''Societas Jesu'' turned into ''Vitiosa seces'' (Latin: Cut off the wicked things). Puttenham, in the time of [[Elizabeth I of England]], wished to start from ''Elissabet Anglorum Regina'' (Latin: Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain ''Multa regnabis ense gloria'' (Latin: By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is \"a note of aspiration only and no letter\", and that Z in [[Zeta|Greek]] or Hebrew is a mere SS.

In both cases, [[Johannes Kepler]] had solved the anagrams incorrectly, assuming they were talking about the [[Moons of Mars]] (''{{lang|la|Salve, umbistineum geminatum Martia proles}}'') and a [[Great Red Spot|red spot on Jupiter]] (''{{lang|la|Macula rufa in Jove est gyratur mathem}}''), respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=Galileo, Kepler, & Two Anagrams: Two Wrong Solutions Turn Into Two Correct Solutions |url=http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/62652246148/galileo-kepler-two-anagrams-two-wrong |website=Judge Starling}}</ref> By coincidence, he turned out to be right about the actual objects existing.\n\nIn 1656, [[Christiaan Huygens]], using a better telescope than those available to Galileo, figured that Galileo's earlier observations of Saturn actually meant it had a ring (Galileo's tools were only sufficient to see it as bumps) and, like Galileo, had published an anagram, ''{{not a typo|aaaaaaacccccdeeeeeghiiiiiiillllmmnnnnnnnnnooooppqrrstttttuuuuu}}''. Upon confirming his observations, three years later he revealed it to mean ''{{lang|la|Annulo cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam coherente, ad eclipticam inclinato}}'' (Latin: It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic).<ref name = \"Campbell1937\">{{Cite book | last = Campbell | first = John W., Jr. | author-link = John W.

For example, [[Jim Morrison]] used an anagram of his name in [[The Doors]] song ''[[L.A. Woman (song)|L.A. Woman]]'', calling himself \"Mr. Mojo Risin'\". The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when [[Edward Cave]] wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/pooleyj.html |title=Institute of Historical Research (IHR) home page |access-date=7 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043325/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/pooleyj.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a genre such as [[farce]] or [[parody]], anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.\n\nPseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus \"[[John Calvin|Calvinus]]\" becomes \"Alcuinus\" (here V = U) or \"[[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]\" = \"Alcofribas Nasier\". The name \"[[Voltaire]]\" of Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of \"Arouet, l[e] j[eune]\" (U = V, J = I) that is, \"Arouet the younger\". Other examples include:\n* \"[[Damon Albarn]]\" = \"Dan Abnormal\"\n* \"[[Dave Barry]]\" = \"Ray Adverb\"\n* \"[[Arrigo Boito]]\" = \"Tobia Gorrio\"\n* \"[[Buckethead]]\" = \"Death Cube K\"\n* \"[[Daniel Clowes]]\" = \"[[Enid Coleslaw]]\"\n* \"[[Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy]]\" = \"Shanghai Nobody\"\n* \"[[Glen Duncan]]\" = \"Declan Gunn\"<ref>[[I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)]]</ref>\n* \"[[Dr. Seuss|(Theodor) Giesel]]\" = \"(Theo) Le Sieg\"\n* \"[[Edward Gorey]]\" = \"Ogdred Weary\", = \"Regera Dowdy\" or = \"E. G. Deadworry\" (and others)\n* \"[[Tales of the City|Anna Madrigal]]\" = \"A man and a girl\"\n* \"Tom Marvolo Riddle\" = \"I am Lord Voldemort\"\n* \"[[Ted Morgan (writer)|Ted Morgan]]\" = \"(Sanche) de Gramont\"\n* \"[[Lorin Morgan-Richards]]\" = \"Marcil d'Hirson Garron\"\n* \"[[Vladimir Nabokov]]\" = \"Vivian Darkbloom\", = \"Vivian Bloodmark\", = \"Blavdak Vinomori\", or = \"Dorian Vivalkomb\"\n* \"[[Elon Musk]]\" = \"[[Muskmelon]]\"\n\nSeveral of these are \"imperfect anagrams\", letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.\n\n===Titles===\nAnagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit. Examples:\n* [[Homer Hickam, Jr.]]'s book ''[[Rocket Boys]]'' was adapted into the 1999 film ''[[October Sky]]''.<ref name=\"CB\">{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9217|title=Anagrams|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2009-11-29|work=Word Play|publisher=Criminal Brief}}</ref>\n* The tapes for the revival of the [[BBC]] show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' were labeled with the anagram ''Torchwood'', which later went on to be used as the name for a [[Torchwood|spin-off show]]. In multi-episode shows, the program occasionally substitutes the anagram of an actor's name for the actual name to prevent revealing the true identity of the role (for instance, The Master) being played by the actor.\n* The New Wave band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]' best-selling album was called ''[[Spring Session M]]''.\n* Hip-hop artist [[MF DOOM]] recorded a 2004 album called ''[[Mm.. Food|MM..FOOD]]''.\n* [[Brian Eno]]'s album ''Before and After Science'' includes a song entitled \"King's Lead Hat\", an anagram of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", a band Eno has worked with.\n* [[Juan Maria Solare]]'s piano ballad \"Jura ser anomal\u00eda\" (literally \"he/she swears to be an anomaly\") is an anagram of the composer's full name. His composition for [[English horn]] titled \"A Dot in Time\" is an anagram of \"Meditation\", which describes the piece. The title of his piano piece that is a homage to Claude Debussy is \"Seduce Us Badly\".\n* [[Bill Evans]]'s [[overdubbed]] piano elegy for fellow jazz pianist [[Sonny Clark]] is titled \"N.Y.C.'s No Lark,\" and another composition, \"Re: Person I Knew\" is a tribute to his producer, [[Orrin Keepnews]].\n* The title of [[Imogen Heap]]'s album ''[[iMegaphone]]'' is an anagram of her name.\n* Progressive rock group [[Rush (band)|Rush]] published a song off their 1989 album ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]'' titled \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" that makes use of anagrams in every line of their song.\n* The title of the fifth album by American rock band [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], ''[[El Pintor (Interpol album)|El Pintor]]'', is an anagram of the band's name and also Spanish for \"the painter\".\n* Many of the song titles on Aphex Twin's ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'' are anagrams of either \"Aphex Twin\", \"The Aphex Twin\", or \"Richard D James\".\n* In [[Disney's]] 1964 film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', [[Dick Van Dyke]] played Mr. Dawes, Sr., as the anagram of his name, Navckid Keyd. In the credits, the words unscrambled themselves to reveal his name.\n\n===Coincidences===\nIn Hebrew, the name \"[[Gernot Zippe]]\" (\u05d2\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4), the inventor of the [[Zippe-type centrifuge]], is an anagram of the word \"centrifuge\" (\u05e6\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4).{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Games and puzzles===\nAnagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows. The [[Jumble]] is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. [[Cryptic crossword]] puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like \"confused\" or \"in disarray\". An example would be ''Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)''. The solution, ''stationer'', is an anagram of ''into tears'', the letters of which have ''burst'' out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of ''businessman''.\n\nNumerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:\n* In [[Anagrams]], players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can \"steal\" each other's words by rearranging the letters and extending the words.\n* In a version of [[Scrabble]] called [[Clabbers]], the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.\n* On the British game show ''[[countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters.\n* In [[Boggle]], players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes.\n* On the British game show ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a \"Pyramid\" which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.\n* In [[Bananagrams]], players place tiles from a pool into [[Crossword|crossword-style]] word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first.\n* Other anagram games include [[Bonza (Word Game)]], [[Bookworm (video game)]], [[Dabble]], [[Jumble]], [[Letterpress (video game)]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Word Force]], [[WordSpot]], and [[Words with Friends]].\n\n===Ciphers===<!-- This section  heading is linked to in [[Rasterschl\u00fcssel 44]] if you change it, please change it their as well. -->\nMultiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a [[permutation cipher]], a [[transposition cipher]], and the [[Jefferson disk]].<ref>[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page55.htm Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary].

Some programs (such as ''Lexpert'') restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, [http://findwords.online4me.com The Words Oracle]) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations.\n\nSome anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done \"manually\" or \"by hand\"; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted \"by machine\" or \"by computer\", or may indicate the name of the computer program (using ''Anagram Genius'').\n\nThere are also a few \"natural\" instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French ''chaise longue'' (\"long chair\") became the American \"[[chaise longue|chaise lounge]]\" by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English \"curd\" comes from the Latin ''crudus'' (\"raw\"). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was \"brid\".\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Internet Anagram Server"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://wordsmith.org/anagram/"}]}, {"name": "Cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.word-grabber.com/anagram-solver"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Anagram Solver {{!}} Finding cool and funny Anagrams"}, {"name": "work", "value": "word-grabber.com"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-02-02"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en-US"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.fastanagrammer.com/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Fast Anagrammer: Fastest on the web for Scrabble, Words with Friends, and other word games"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.fastanagrammer.com"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-02-02"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": "Prominent anagrammatists", "paragraphs": "The French king [[Louis XIII]] had a man named Thomas Billen appointed as his Royal Anagrammatist with an annual salary of 1200 pounds.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Southey|first=Robert|chapter=CLXXIX|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIxUAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA467|title=The Doctor, Etc|publisher=Longman, Greens, and Co.|year=1865|pages=467}}</ref> Among contemporary anagrammers, [[Anu Garg]], the founder of Wordsmith.org, created the [https://wordsmith.org/anagram/ Internet Anagram Server] in 1994.
