Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"[[reinforcement learning]]\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a \"[[reward function]]\".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"[[fitness function]]\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.<ref>Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., & Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152.</ref>\n\nAI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n# If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\n# if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\n# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\n# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\n# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\n# take any empty square.\n\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial \"[[neurons]]\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}<!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --><ref>{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swan theory|black swans]] exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\n\n[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations.

For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|date=May 2018|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possible developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref>\n\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\" />\n\n=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/> In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/>\n\n=== Knowledge representation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge<ref name=\"Ontology\"/> by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/>\n;Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n=== Planning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future\u2014a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\u2014and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n=== Learning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,<ref>[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]], which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.<ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M.

Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48\u201357|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}</ref>\n\n=== Perception ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[File:\u00c4\u00e4retuvastuse n\u00e4ide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world.

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/>\n;Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Knowledge representation"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Commonsense knowledge"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Sikos"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Leslie F."}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 2017"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Cham"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Springer"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-3-319-54066-5"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "29 August 2017"}, {"name": "df", "value": "dmy-all"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Smoliar"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Stephen W."}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Zhang"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "HongJiang"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Content based video indexing and retrieval"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "IEEE Multimedia"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1994"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "62\u201372"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1109/93.311653"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Neumann"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Bernd"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "M\u00f6ller"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Ralf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "On scene interpretation with description logics"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Image and Vision Computing"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 2008"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "26"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "1"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "82\u2013101"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.imavis.2007.08.013"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Kuperman"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "G.

Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\n\n=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n=== Symbolic ===\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.<ref name=\"AI at CMU in the 60s\"/><ref name=\"Soar\"/>\n\n==== Logic-based ====\nUnlike Simon and Newell, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless whether people used the same algorithms.<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/> His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"AI at Stanford in the 60s\"/> Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].<ref name=\"AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s\"/>\n\n==== Anti-logic or scruffy ====\nResearchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])<ref name=\"AI at MIT in the 60s\"/> found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions\u2014they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]\" (as opposed to the \"[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]\" paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and Stanford).<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/> [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Cyc\"/>\n\n====Knowledge-based====\nWhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.<ref name=\"Knowledge revolution\"/> This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.<ref name=\"Expert systems\"/> A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Frederick |first=Hayes-Roth |last2=William |first2=Murray |last3=Leonard |first3=Adelman |title=Expert systems |language=en |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.248550}}</ref> The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\n\n=== Sub-symbolic ===\nBy the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/> Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]]. Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.<ref name=\"Embodied AI\"/> Their work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n====Computational intelligence and soft computing====\nInterest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]\u2014they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[Grey system theory]], [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|GOFAI]] got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to [[symbolic computation]] that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a \"victory of the neats\" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725\u2013726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}</ref> Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}\n\n=== Integrating the approaches ===\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\u2014some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s:Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[Intelligent agent|intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence.

A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n=== Search and optimization ===\n\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6940-7|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\n\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> involves [[truth function]]s such as \"or\" and \"not\". [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> adds [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy set theory]] assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. [[Fuzzy logic]] is successfully used in [[control system]]s to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.{{efn|\"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance...

AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. [[Google AdSense|AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/> is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/> and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/> Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O'Brien|Marakas|2011}}\n\nProposed \"universal intelligence\" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible. At an extreme, the test suite can contain every possible problem, weighted by [[Kolmogorov complexity]]; unfortunately, these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern-matching exercises where a tuned AI can easily exceed human performance levels.<ref name=\"Mathematical definitions of intelligence\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo|first1=Jos\u00e9|last2=Dowe|first2=David L.|last3=Hern\u00e1ndez-Lloreda|first3=M.Victoria|title=Universal psychometrics: Measuring cognitive abilities in the machine kingdom|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=March 2014|volume=27|pages=50\u201374|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2013.06.001|hdl=10251/50244}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Search algorithm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Mathematical optimization"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Evolutionary computation"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Tecuci"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2012"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "Daniel Merkle"}, {"name": "author2", "value": "Martin Middendorf"}, {"name": "editor1-last", "value": "Burke"}, {"name": "editor1-first", "value": "Edmund K."}, {"name": "editor2-last", "value": "Kendall"}, {"name": "editor2-first", "value": "Graham"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Springer Science & Business Media"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-1-4614-6940-7"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Swarm Intelligence"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Logic programming"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Automated reasoning"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance...

in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms.

Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches.

Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Classifier (mathematics)"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Statistical classification"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Machine learning"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Domingos"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "88"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Domingos"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "187"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Domingos"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "188"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Domingos"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "152"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Russell"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Norvig"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary"}]}], "id": 30}, {"title": " Artificial neural networks ", "paragraphs": "\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O'Brien|Marakas|2011}}\n\nProposed \"universal intelligence\" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible.

In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>McFarland, Matt. \"Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more\". ''The Washington Post'' 25 February 2015. Infotrac Newsstand. 24 October 2016</ref> Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.<ref>\"Programming safety into self-driving cars\". National Science Foundation. N.p., 2 February 2015. 24 October 2016.</ref>\n\nAnother factor that is influencing the ability for a driver-less automobile is the safety of the passenger. To make a driver-less automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians. The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car. But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger. In other words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers.<ref>ArXiv, E. T. (26 October 2015). Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill.

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>McFarland, Matt. \"Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more\".

To make a driver-less automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians. The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car.

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nConcern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments.

In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.

Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature &#124;'The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88\u2013100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]]\u2014will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]\n</ref> The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain.\n\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\u2014they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\n\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that [[John Searle]] has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? This issue, now known as \"[[robot rights]]\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.<ref name=\"Robot rights\"/> Some critics of [[transhumanism]] argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights. <ref Name=\"Evans 2015\">{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | df = dmy-all | doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}</ref> The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film \u2013 Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Robots -|author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212040134/http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and many sci fi media such as [[Star Trek]] Next Generation, with the character of [[Commander Data]], who fought being disassembled for research, and wanted to \"become human\", and the robotic holograms in Voyager.\n\n=== Superintelligence ===\n{{Main|Superintelligence}}\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines\u2014or human-machine hybrids\u2014can be?

The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario \"[[technological singularity|singularity]]\".<ref name=Singularity/> Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization.

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nConcern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments.

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nConcern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments.

In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.

Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop.
