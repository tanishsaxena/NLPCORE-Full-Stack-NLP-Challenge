By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101, [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} The disposition of [[Essex]], held by West Saxon kings since the days of [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], is unclear from the treaty though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 2015, two metal detectorists operating without landowner permission found a large hoard near [[Leominster]] consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. The hoard is believed to have been buried by a Viking during their raids of the area, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred and Mercia by Ceolwulf II.

A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships \"on the high seas\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces.{{sfn|Alfred|1969|p=76}} Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period, as they had for decades.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 883\u2014though there is some debate over the year\u2014King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]].{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=78}} Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the [[true cross]], a great treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=23}}\n\nThis is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=106}} This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact, he would never adopt the title for himself. Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=89}} Guthrum's death changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of King Alfred The Great and the Danes|url=http://www.localhistories.org/alfred.html|publisher=Local Histories|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Viking attacks (890s)===\n\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege of Exeter (893)|Siege of Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2019"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "582"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Abels"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "140\u201341"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Abels"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "140\u201341"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Brooks"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Graham-Campbell"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1986"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "91\u2013110"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "582"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Giles"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Ingram"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1996"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Year 876"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Arnold"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "p", "value": "59"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Giles"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Ingram"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1996"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Year 877"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Giles"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Ingram"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1996"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Year 878"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "582"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Crown staff"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Savage"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1988"}, {"name": "p", "value": "101"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "The inscription reads \"ALFRED THE GREAT AD 879 on this Summit Erected his Standard Against Danish Invaders To him We owe The Origin of Juries The Establishment of a Militia The Creation of a Naval Force ALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age Was a Philosopher and a Christian The Father of his People The Founder of the English MONARCHY and LIBERTY\" {{harv|Horspool|2006|pages=73}}"}]}, {"name": "harv", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Horspool"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "73"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Giles"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Ingram"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1996"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Year 878"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lavelle"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "187\u201391"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "582"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A chrisom was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[Baptism|baptised]] or christened.

Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom.

He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]].

By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101, [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} The disposition of [[Essex]], held by West Saxon kings since the days of [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], is unclear from the treaty though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 2015, two metal detectorists operating without landowner permission found a large hoard near [[Leominster]] consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE.

Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river.

Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful.

They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege of Exeter (893)|Siege of Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Merkle"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "p", "value": "220"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "115\u201316, 286"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Merkle"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "p", "value": "220"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "115\u201316, 286"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "583"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "583"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "20"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "3", "value": "km"}, {"name": "spell", "value": "in"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "583"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Military reorganisation", "paragraphs": "[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}<ref>{{harvnb|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}</ref>\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (later termed ''[[borough]]s'') ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Preston"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Wise"},

It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution.

In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged.

It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings.

In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments.

The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges.

Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391.

[[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.<ref>Janet M. Bately, 'Alfred as Author and Translator' in ''A Companion to Alfred the Great'', ed. by Nicole Guenther Discenza and Paul E. Szarmach (Leiden: Brill, 2014), pp. 113\u201342, {{doi|10.1163/9789004283763_006}}.</ref>\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2",

Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.<ref>Janet M. Bately, 'Alfred as Author and Translator' in ''A Companion to Alfred the Great'', ed. by Nicole Guenther Discenza and Paul E. Szarmach (Leiden: Brill, 2014), pp. 113\u201342, {{doi|10.1163/9789004283763_006}}.</ref>\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "p", "value": "126"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "125\u201326"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "125\u201326"}]}, {"name": "doi", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "10.1163/9789004283763_006"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "583"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bately"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1970"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "433\u201360"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bately"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "45\u201378"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "33\u201334"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "584"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Paul"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "MS Ii.2.4"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schepss"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1895"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "149\u201360"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "p", "value": "133"}]}, {"name": "citation", "values": [{"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford Bodleian Library"}, {"name": "title", "value": "MS Bodley 180"}]}, {"name": "citation", "values": [{"name": "mode", "value": "cs1"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "British Library"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Cotton MS Otho A."}, {"name": "volume", "value": "vi"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kiernan"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\""}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Plummer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "584"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Parker"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "115\u201326"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2+1/2"}, {"name": "2", "value": "in"}, {"name": "3", "value": "cm"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "off"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pratt"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "189\u201391"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "203\u201306"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Abels"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "219\u201357"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Keynes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Lapidge"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "124\u201345"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sedgefield"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1900"}, {"name": "p", "value": "35"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Abels"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "219\u201357"}]}], "id": 18}, {"title": "Appearance and character", "paragraphs": "[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life.

Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well.

Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|The Church Monuments Society|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred.

In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis that had been unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, and had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period.

Later medieval historians such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.
