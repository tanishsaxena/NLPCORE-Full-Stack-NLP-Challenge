He was the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the second half of the 12th century, and was the closest advisor of King [[Valdemar I of Denmark]]. He was a key figure in the Danish policies of territorial expansion in the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Europeanization]] in close relationship with the [[Holy See]], and reform in the relation between the Church and the public. He combined the ideals of [[Gregorian Reform]] with loyal support of a strong [[monarch]]ical power.\n\nAbsalon was born into the powerful ''[[Hvide]]'' clan, and owned great land possessions. He endowed several church institutions, most prominently his family's [[Sor\u00f8 Abbey]]. He was granted lands by the crown, and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day [[Copenhagen]]. His titles were passed on to his nephews [[Anders Sunesen]] and [[Peder Sunesen]]. He died in 1201, and was interred at Sor\u00f8 Abbey.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Other uses", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Absalon (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "Infobox Bishop\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Absalon"}, {"name": "title", "value": "[[Bishop of Roskilde]]<br>[[Archbishop of Lund]]"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Copenhagen statue of Absalon.jpg"}, {"name": "imagesize", "value": "235px"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Statue of Absalon in Copenhagen"}, {"name": "diocese", "value": "[[Diocese of Roskilde]] (1158\u20131192)<br>[[Diocese of Lund|Archdiocese of Lund]] (1178\u20131201)"}, {"name": "predecessor", "value": "[[Asser of Roskilde]]<br>[[Eskil of Lund]]"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "[[Peder Sunesen]] (Roskilde)<br>[[Anders Sunesen]] (Lund)"}, {"name": "birth_name", "value": "Absalon"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{c.|1128}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "near [[Sor\u00f8]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|1201|3|21|1128|df=y}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Sor\u00f8]]"}, {"name": "buried", "value": "[[Sor\u00f8 Abbey]]"}]}, {"name": "c.", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1128"}]}, {"name": "death date and age", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1201"}, {"name": "2", "value": "3"}, {"name": "3", "value": "21"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1128"}, {"name": "df", "value": "y"}]}, {"name": "cite Americana", "values": [{"name": "wstitle", "value": "Axel"}]}, {"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1128"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Early life", "paragraphs": "Absalon was born around 1128 near [[Sor\u00f8]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].<ref name=ea/> Due to his name being unusual in Denmark, it is speculated that he was baptized on the Danish \"Absalon\" [[name day]], October 30.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> He was the son of [[Asser Rig]], a [[magnate]] of the ''[[Hvide]]'' clan from Fjenneslev on [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]],<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Absalon|volume=1|pages=73\u201374}}</ref> and [[Inger Eriksdotter]].
