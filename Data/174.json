Like many regular army officers from the South, he was opposed to secession. But he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state of Texas. It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3.<ref>Johnston, p. 273.</ref> On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles, the home of his wife's brother John Griffin.

Gen. [[George H. Thomas]] moved against the Confederates, Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas's command at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite.<ref name=\"Woodworth, p. 66\"/> At the [[Battle of Mill Springs]] on January 19, 1862, the ill-prepared Confederates, after a night march in the rain, attacked the Union force with some initial success.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> As the battle progressed, Zollicoffer was killed, Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force (he may have been intoxicated), and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge, suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000.<ref>Woodworth, p. 67.</ref><ref>Long, p. 162.</ref> The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as General Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct.<ref>Woodworth, p. 69.</ref>\n\nAfter the Confederate defeat at the Mill Springs, Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements. He also assigned him Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]], who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war, and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> The brigade was led by Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], considered incompetent. He took command at [[Fort Donelson]] as the senior general present just before Union Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] attacked the fort.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 80, 84.</ref> Historians believe the assignment of Beauregard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beauregard could make a difference in the theater.

Gen. Polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command. After Johnston took command, Polk at first refused to comply with Johnston's order to send an engineer, Lt. Joseph K. Dixon, to inspect the forts.<ref name=\"Woodworth57\">Woodworth, p. 57.</ref> After Johnston asserted his authority, Polk had to allow Dixon to proceed. Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened, although they were not in ideal locations, because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones.

As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse. One of his most famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the Union camps, and was outraged to see a young lieutenant among them.  \"None of that, sir,\" Johnston roared at the officer, \"we are not here for plunder.\"  Then, realizing he had embarrassed the man, he picked up a tin cup off a table and announced, \"Let this be my share of the spoils today,\" before directing his army onward.<ref>https://history.army.mil/news/2013/130401a_shiloh.html</ref>\n\nAt about 2:30&nbsp;pm, while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the \"Peach Orchard,\" he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. The bullet clipped a part of his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood.  There were no medical personnel on scene at the time, since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners earlier in the battle.<ref name=\"civilwarlandscapes.org\">{{cite web|title=Battlefield Tours: Full Tour Shiloh|url=http://www.civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jd.htm|website=Civil War Landscapes Association|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: \"General, are you wounded?\" Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words: \"Yes... and I fear seriously.\" Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the \"Hornets Nest\" and desperately tried to aid the general, who had lost consciousness by this point. Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston's surgeon but did not apply a [[tourniquet]] to Johnson's wounded leg. A few minutes later, before a doctor could be found, Johnston died from blood loss. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound.  Ironically, it was later discovered that Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died.<ref name=\"civilwarlandscapes.org\"/>\n\nHarris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle.  P. G. T. Beauregard assumed command of the army and resumed leading the Confederate assault, which continued advancing and pushed the Union force back to a final defensive line near the Tennessee river.  With his army exhausted and daylight almost gone, Beauregard called off the final Confederate attack around 1900 hours, figuring he could finish off the Union army the following morning.  However, Grant was reinforced by 20,000 fresh troops from [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]] during the night, and led a successful counter-attack the following day, driving the Confederates from the field and winning the battle.  As the Confederate army retreated back to Corinth, Johnston's body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.<ref>Sword, pp. 270\u201373, 443\u201346; Cunningham, pp. 273\u201376; Smith, pp. 26\u201334.

As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse. One of his most famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the Union camps, and was outraged to see a young lieutenant among them.  \"None of that, sir,\" Johnston roared at the officer, \"we are not here for plunder.\"  Then, realizing he had embarrassed the man, he picked up a tin cup off a table and announced, \"Let this be my share of the spoils today,\" before directing his army onward.<ref>https://history.army.mil/news/2013/130401a_shiloh.html</ref>\n\nAt about 2:30&nbsp;pm, while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the \"Peach Orchard,\" he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. The bullet clipped a part of his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood.  There were no medical personnel on scene at the time, since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners earlier in the battle.<ref name=\"civilwarlandscapes.org\">{{cite web|title=Battlefield Tours: Full Tour Shiloh|url=http://www.civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jd.htm|website=Civil War Landscapes Association|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: \"General, are you wounded?\" Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words: \"Yes... and I fear seriously.\" Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the \"Hornets Nest\" and desperately tried to aid the general, who had lost consciousness by this point. Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston's surgeon but did not apply a [[tourniquet]] to Johnson's wounded leg. A few minutes later, before a doctor could be found, Johnston died from blood loss. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound.  Ironically, it was later discovered that Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died.<ref name=\"civilwarlandscapes.org\"/>\n\nHarris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle.  P. G. T. Beauregard assumed command of the army and resumed leading the Confederate assault, which continued advancing and pushed the Union force back to a final defensive line near the Tennessee river.  With his army exhausted and daylight almost gone, Beauregard called off the final Confederate attack around 1900 hours, figuring he could finish off the Union army the following morning.  However, Grant was reinforced by 20,000 fresh troops from [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]] during the night, and led a successful counter-attack the following day, driving the Confederates from the field and winning the battle.  As the Confederate army retreated back to Corinth, Johnston's body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.<ref>Sword, pp. 270\u201373, 443\u201346; Cunningham, pp. 273\u201376; Smith, pp. 26\u201334.
