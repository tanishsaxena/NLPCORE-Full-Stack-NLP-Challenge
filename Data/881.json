It was the first mission in the United States' [[Apollo program]] to carry a crew into space. It was also the first U.S. spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of [[Gemini 12|Gemini XII]] in November 1966. The [[Apollo 1|AS-204 mission]], also known as \"Apollo 1\", was intended to be the first crewed flight of the Apollo program. It was scheduled to launch in February 1967, but a [[Apollo 1#Accident|fire]] in the cabin during a January 1967 test killed the crew. Crewed flights were then suspended for 21 months, while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements made to the spacecraft and safety procedures, and uncrewed test flights of the [[Saturn V]] rocket and [[Apollo Lunar Module]] were made. Apollo 7 fulfilled Apollo 1's mission of testing the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM) in [[low Earth orbit]].\n\nThe Apollo 7 crew was commanded by [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra]], with senior pilot / navigator [[Donn F. Eisele]], and pilot / systems engineer [[Walter Cunningham|R. Walter Cunningham]]. Official crew titles were made consistent with those that would be used for the crewed lunar landing missions: Eisele was Command Module Pilot and Cunningham was Lunar Module Pilot. Their mission was [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|Apollo's 'C' mission]], an 11-day Earth-orbital test flight to check out the redesigned Block II CSM with a crew on board. It was the first time a [[Saturn IB]] vehicle put a crew into space; Apollo 7 was the first three-person American space mission, and the first to include a live TV broadcast from an American spacecraft. It was launched on October 11, 1968, from what was then known as [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]], Florida. Despite tension between the crew and ground controllers, the mission was a complete technical success, giving [[NASA]] the confidence to send [[Apollo 8]] into orbit around the [[Moon]] two months later. The flight would prove to be the final space flight for all of its three crew members\u2014and the only one for both Cunningham and Eisele\u2014when it splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on October 22, 1968. It was also the only [[Human spaceflight|crewed launch]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]], as well as the last launch from the complex.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "pp-move-indef", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "First crewed mission of the Apollo space program"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox spaceflight\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Apollo 7"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Apollo 7 during the first live television transmission from space.jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "Apollo 7 transmitted the first live television broadcast aboard a crewed American spacecraft."}, {"name": "insignia", "value": "Apollo7.png"}, {"name": "mission_type", "value": "Crewed Earth orbital CSM flight ([[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|C]])"}, {"name": "operator", "value": "[[NASA]]<ref name=\"Orloff\">{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=July 6, 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=[[NASA]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Table of Contents |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_00g_Table_of_Contents.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |archivedate=August 23, 2007}}</ref>"}, {"name": "COSPAR_ID", "value": "1968-089A"}, {"name": "SATCAT", "value": "3486"}, {"name": "mission_duration", "value": "{{time interval|11 October 1968 15:02:45|22 October 1968 11:11:48|show=dhms|sep=,}}"}, {"name": "orbits_completed", "value": "163"}, {"name": "spacecraft", "value": "[[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo CSM-101]]"}, {"name": "manufacturer", "value": "[[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]]"}, {"name": "launch_mass", "value": "{{convert|36419|lb|kg}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760072144_1976072144.pdf |title=Apollo 7 Mission Report |date=December 1, 1968 |publisher=NASA |page=A-47 |format=PDF |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>"}, {"name": "landing_mass", "value": "{{convert|11409|lb|kg}}"}, {"name": "launch_date", "value": "{{start-date|October 11, 1968, 15:02:45|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC"}, {"name": "launch_rocket", "value": "[[Saturn IB]] SA-205"}, {"name": "launch_site", "value": "[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|LC-34]]"}, {"name": "landing_date", "value": "{{end-date|October 22, 1968, 11:11:48|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC"}, {"name": "landing_site", "value": "North Atlantic Ocean<br/>{{coord|27|32|N|64|04|W|type:event|name=Apollo 7 splashdown}}"}, {"name": "recovery_by", "value": "{{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}"}, {"name": "orbit_epoch", "value": "October 13, 1968<ref name=satcat>{{cite web |last=McDowell |first=Jonathan |title=SATCAT |url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt |publisher=Jonathan's Space Pages |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>"}, {"name": "orbit_reference", "value": "[[geocentric orbit|Geocentric]]"}, {"name": "orbit_regime", "value": "[[Low Earth orbit]]"}, {"name": "orbit_periapsis", "value": "{{convert|227|km|nmi|sp=us}}"}, {"name": "orbit_apoapsis", "value": "{{convert|301|km|nmi|sp=us}}"}, {"name": "orbit_inclination", "value": "31.6&nbsp;degrees"}, {"name": "orbit_period", "value": "89.79&nbsp;minutes"}, {"name": "apsis", "value": "gee"}, {"name": "crew_size", "value": "3"}, {"name": "crew_members", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |[[Wally Schirra|Walter M.

They were to fly a second Earth orbital test of the original Block I command and service module (not designed to dock with the [[lunar module]] for lunar flight) after [[Apollo 1]], the first crewed flight, to be made by [[Gus Grissom|Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]]. In December 1966, the second mission was deemed redundant and canceled, and Schirra's crew were reassigned as Grissom's backup.\n\nPlans for the first crewed Apollo flights were completely disrupted by the January 27, 1967 cabin fire which killed Grissom, White, and Chaffee. Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were later named as prime crew for the first crewed flight, which would now use the Block II spacecraft designed for the lunar missions. The [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) and astronauts' spacesuits had been extensively redesigned, to reduce and eliminate the chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew.

Apollo 7 was still equipped with the old Apollo 1-style crew couches, which did not provide adequate shock protection in the event of a terrestrial landing. The crew couches had been since redesigned, but the new units were not ready in time for the launch. While seated inside the command module, Schirra protested that launching with the wind going east to west was dangerous, but these complaints were ignored by the blockhouse crew.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/02_on2018-forgotten-apollo-7-mission-180970365/ |title=The Flight (and Fights) of Apollo 7 |journal=Air & Space Magazine |first=Tom |last=Jones |date=October 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing orbital injection and separation from the [[S-IVB]], the crew turned the CSM around using its [[Reaction control system|Reaction Control System]] thrusters, and Eisele practiced a simulated lunar module rendezvous and docking, using a visual reference target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the LM. One of the adapter panels on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding [[Flight controller#CAPCOM|CAPCOM]] [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]] of his \"angry alligator\" experience on [[Gemini 9A]], when docking was prevented by mis-deployed adapter panels. Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts might have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.<ref name=\"astronautix.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |title=Apollo 7 |last=Wade |first=Mark |website=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012111046/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|service propulsion system]] (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo into and out of lunar orbit, made eight firings, performing within 1% of the engine acceptance test thrust and [[specific impulse]] values. As the Saturn IB itself had performed very smoothly during launch, the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the SPS, leading to Schirra yelling \"Yabbadabbadoo!\" in reference to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' cartoon. Don Eisele called it \"a real boot in the rear\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760072144_1976072144.pdf |title=Apollo 7 Mission Report |date=December 1, 1968 |publisher=NASA |pages=5\u2013158 |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nAn assortment of minor hardware problems occurred over the flight; these included the drinking water hose trigger sticking during the final two days, a momentary undervoltage of the main AC buses caused by the automatic cryo fan switch in the service module LOX and LH2 tanks, and a loss of telemetry due to a malfunctioning electrical commutator following SM jettison at the end of the mission, meaning that the final 15 minutes of data transmission were lost. Aside from the last event, which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator, all of the problems on Apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions.\n\nApollo promised the best food ever eaten in space. For the first time, astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with (the food came in freeze-dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water) and Wally Schirra, who had had only toothpaste-like tubes for food on his [[Mercury-Atlas 8|Mercury flight]], described the food as \"still does not match home cooking, but it comes a lot closer than space food used to\". Thirty-three meals were provided for the three crewmen, allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space. Even so, the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet, although the menus had been prepared based on their personal preferences.\n\nEarly fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the CM would make it hard for the spacecraft's attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded, and they reported that motion was \"incredibly easy\" with no gravity to work against. As sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful, a stretching device called the Exer-Genie was provided for relaxing aching muscles.<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\nAnother mission goal was the first [[Apollo TV camera|live television]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] from an American spacecraft ([[Gordon Cooper]] had transmitted [[Slow-scan television|slow scan television]] pictures from [[Mercury-Atlas 9|''Faith 7'']] in 1963, which were never broadcast).<ref name=\"Apollo video camera\">[[#Steven-Boniecki 2010|Steven-Boniecki 2010]], pp. 55\u201358</ref> It was initially scheduled for midday on day two, but Schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] test.<ref name=\"Schirra Cancels TV\">{{cite news |title=Schirra rules no telecast |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UjQ_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=cVEMAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo%207%20television%20broadcast&pg=1799%2C3226547 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |newspaper=[[Windsor Star|The Windsor Star]] |date=October 12, 1968 |agency=United Press International |location=Windsor, Ontario |page=1 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===\"Mutiny\" in space===\nEven though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less-than-ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew [[motion sickness]], which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew were unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe [[Common cold|head cold]]. As a result, he became irritable with requests from [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)|Mission Control]] and all three astronauts began \"talking back\" to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:\n[[Image:Walter Schirra on Apollo 7.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Schirra]] looks out the rendezvous window in front of the commander's station on the ninth day of the mission]]\n<blockquote>\nSCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.<br />\nCAPCOM ([[Jack Swigert]]): Roger. Copy.<br />\nSCHIRRA: Roger.<br />\nCAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Apollo 7, this is CAPCOM number 1.<br />\nSCHIRRA: Roger.<br />\nCAPCOM 1: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: ... with two commanders, Apollo 7<br />\nCAPCOM 1: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.<br />\nSCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |pages=117\u2013118 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous Project Mercury and Gemini experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to [[Valsalva maneuver|pinch their noses and blow]] to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous \"fishbowl\" type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:\n<blockquote>\nCAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand that there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on. <br />\nSCHIRRA: And there is no experience with the helmet either on that one. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes. <br />\nSCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Yes. <br />\nSCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less\nabout the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: Thank you, babe. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Over and out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |page=1170 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nExchanges such as this led to Eisele and Cunningham being rejected for future missions (Schirra had already announced his impending retirement from NASA).<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\n===Reentry and post-flight evaluation===\n\nThe [[splashdown]] point was {{coord|27|32|N|64|04|W}}, {{convert|200|nmi|km}} SSW of [[Bermuda]] and {{convert|7|nmi|km|abbr=on}} north of the recovery ship [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']].<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\nDespite the difficulties between the crew and Mission Control, the mission successfully met its objectives to verify the Apollo command and service module's flight worthiness, allowing Apollo 8's flight to the Moon to proceed just two months later.<ref name=\"Apollo Crew Honored 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102008a.html |title=First Apollo flight crew last to be honored |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |date=October 20, 2008 |website=collectSPACE |publisher=Robert Pearlman |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Apollo 7 was Project Apollo's only human spaceflight mission to launch from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]].<ref>The Air Force Station was originally named Cape Canaveral, but the name was changed to Cape Kennedy by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

Apollo 7 was still equipped with the old Apollo 1-style crew couches, which did not provide adequate shock protection in the event of a terrestrial landing. The crew couches had been since redesigned, but the new units were not ready in time for the launch. While seated inside the command module, Schirra protested that launching with the wind going east to west was dangerous, but these complaints were ignored by the blockhouse crew.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/02_on2018-forgotten-apollo-7-mission-180970365/ |title=The Flight (and Fights) of Apollo 7 |journal=Air & Space Magazine |first=Tom |last=Jones |date=October 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing orbital injection and separation from the [[S-IVB]], the crew turned the CSM around using its [[Reaction control system|Reaction Control System]] thrusters, and Eisele practiced a simulated lunar module rendezvous and docking, using a visual reference target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the LM. One of the adapter panels on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding [[Flight controller#CAPCOM|CAPCOM]] [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]] of his \"angry alligator\" experience on [[Gemini 9A]], when docking was prevented by mis-deployed adapter panels. Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts might have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.<ref name=\"astronautix.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |title=Apollo 7 |last=Wade |first=Mark |website=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012111046/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|service propulsion system]] (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo into and out of lunar orbit, made eight firings, performing within 1% of the engine acceptance test thrust and [[specific impulse]] values. As the Saturn IB itself had performed very smoothly during launch, the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the SPS, leading to Schirra yelling \"Yabbadabbadoo!\" in reference to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' cartoon. Don Eisele called it \"a real boot in the rear\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760072144_1976072144.pdf |title=Apollo 7 Mission Report |date=December 1, 1968 |publisher=NASA |pages=5\u2013158 |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nAn assortment of minor hardware problems occurred over the flight; these included the drinking water hose trigger sticking during the final two days, a momentary undervoltage of the main AC buses caused by the automatic cryo fan switch in the service module LOX and LH2 tanks, and a loss of telemetry due to a malfunctioning electrical commutator following SM jettison at the end of the mission, meaning that the final 15 minutes of data transmission were lost. Aside from the last event, which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator, all of the problems on Apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions.\n\nApollo promised the best food ever eaten in space. For the first time, astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with (the food came in freeze-dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water) and Wally Schirra, who had had only toothpaste-like tubes for food on his [[Mercury-Atlas 8|Mercury flight]], described the food as \"still does not match home cooking, but it comes a lot closer than space food used to\". Thirty-three meals were provided for the three crewmen, allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space. Even so, the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet, although the menus had been prepared based on their personal preferences.\n\nEarly fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the CM would make it hard for the spacecraft's attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded, and they reported that motion was \"incredibly easy\" with no gravity to work against. As sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful, a stretching device called the Exer-Genie was provided for relaxing aching muscles.<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\nAnother mission goal was the first [[Apollo TV camera|live television]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] from an American spacecraft ([[Gordon Cooper]] had transmitted [[Slow-scan television|slow scan television]] pictures from [[Mercury-Atlas 9|''Faith 7'']] in 1963, which were never broadcast).<ref name=\"Apollo video camera\">[[#Steven-Boniecki 2010|Steven-Boniecki 2010]], pp. 55\u201358</ref> It was initially scheduled for midday on day two, but Schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] test.<ref name=\"Schirra Cancels TV\">{{cite news |title=Schirra rules no telecast |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UjQ_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=cVEMAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo%207%20television%20broadcast&pg=1799%2C3226547 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |newspaper=[[Windsor Star|The Windsor Star]] |date=October 12, 1968 |agency=United Press International |location=Windsor, Ontario |page=1 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo7.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 7"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Jeanne"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Ryba"}, {"name": "date", "value": "July 8, 2009"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "May 27, 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/02_on2018-forgotten-apollo-7-mission-180970365/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Flight (and Fights) of Apollo 7"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Air & Space Magazine"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Tom"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Jones"}, {"name": "date", "value": "October 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 7"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Wade"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Mark"}, {"name": "website", "value": "[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "October 24, 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20081012111046/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "October 12, 2008"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760072144_1976072144.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 7 Mission Report"}, {"name": "date", "value": "December 1, 1968"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "5\u2013158"}, {"name": "format", "value": "PDF"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Schirra rules no telecast"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UjQ_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=cVEMAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo%207%20television%20broadcast&pg=1799%2C3226547"}, {"name": "author", "value": "<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->"}, {"name": "newspaper", "value": "[[Windsor Star|The Windsor Star]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "October 12, 1968"}, {"name": "agency", "value": "United Press International"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Windsor, Ontario"}, {"name": "page", "value": "1"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "October 6, 2013"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "\"Mutiny\" in space", "paragraphs": "Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less-than-ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew [[motion sickness]], which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew were unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe [[Common cold|head cold]]. As a result, he became irritable with requests from [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)|Mission Control]] and all three astronauts began \"talking back\" to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:\n[[Image:Walter Schirra on Apollo 7.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Schirra]] looks out the rendezvous window in front of the commander's station on the ninth day of the mission]]\n<blockquote>\nSCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.<br />\nCAPCOM ([[Jack Swigert]]): Roger. Copy.<br />\nSCHIRRA: Roger.<br />\nCAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Apollo 7, this is CAPCOM number 1.<br />\nSCHIRRA: Roger.<br />\nCAPCOM 1: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: ... with two commanders, Apollo 7<br />\nCAPCOM 1: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.<br />\nSCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |pages=117\u2013118 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous Project Mercury and Gemini experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to [[Valsalva maneuver|pinch their noses and blow]] to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous \"fishbowl\" type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:\n<blockquote>\nCAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand that there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on. <br />\nSCHIRRA: And there is no experience with the helmet either on that one. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes. <br />\nSCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Yes. <br />\nSCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less\nabout the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: Thank you, babe. <br />\nCAPCOM 1: Over and out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |page=1170 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nExchanges such as this led to Eisele and Cunningham being rejected for future missions (Schirra had already announced his impending retirement from NASA).<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "117\u2013118"}, {"name": "format", "value": "PDF"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "October 24, 2008"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA"}, {"name": "page", "value": "1170"}, {"name": "format", "value": "PDF"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "May 27, 2017"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Reentry and post-flight evaluation", "paragraphs": "\nThe [[splashdown]] point was {{coord|27|32|N|64|04|W}}, {{convert|200|nmi|km}} SSW of [[Bermuda]] and {{convert|7|nmi|km|abbr=on}} north of the recovery ship [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']].<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\nDespite the difficulties between the crew and Mission Control, the mission successfully met its objectives to verify the Apollo command and service module's flight worthiness, allowing Apollo 8's flight to the Moon to proceed just two months later.<ref name=\"Apollo Crew Honored 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102008a.html |title=First Apollo flight crew last to be honored |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |date=October 20, 2008 |website=collectSPACE |publisher=Robert Pearlman |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Apollo 7 was Project Apollo's only human spaceflight mission to launch from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]].<ref>The Air Force Station was originally named Cape Canaveral, but the name was changed to Cape Kennedy by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.
