He first appeared as leader of a mixed band of [[Goths]] and allied peoples, who invaded [[Thrace]] in 391 but were stopped by the half-[[Vandal]] Roman General [[Stilicho]]. In 394, he led a Gothic force of 20,000 that helped [[Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] defeat the [[Franks|Frankish]] usurper [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]] at the [[Battle of Frigidus]]. Despite sacrificing around 10,000 of his men, Alaric received little recognition from the emperor. Disappointed, he left the army, was elected [[reiks]] of the [[Visigoths]] in 395 and marched toward [[Constantinople]] until he was diverted by Roman forces. He then moved southward into [[Greece]], where he sacked [[Piraeus]] (the port of [[Athens]]) and destroyed [[Corinth]], [[Megara]], [[Argos]] and [[Sparta]]. Nonetheless, the [[Eastern Roman Emperor|Eastern emperor]] [[Arcadius]] appointed Alaric [[magister militum]] (\"master of the soldiers\") in [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]].\n\nIn 401 Alaric invaded Italy, but was defeated by [[Stilicho]] at [[Battle of Pollentia|Pollentia]] (modern Pollenza) on April{{nbsp}}6, 402. A second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Verona (402)|Battle of Verona]], although he did force the [[Roman Senate]] to pay a large subsidy to the Visigoths. During [[Radagaisus]]' Italian invasion in 406, he remained idle in [[Illyria]]. In 408, [[Western Emperor]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] ordered the execution of Stilicho and his family, in response to rumors that the general had made a deal with Alaric. Honorius then incited the Roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of [[foederati]] Goths serving in the Roman military. The Gothic soldiers then defected to Alaric, increasing the size of his force to around 30,000 men, and joined his march on Rome to avenge their murdered families.<ref name=Heather>{{cite book |last=Heather |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Heather|date=2006 |title=The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History |publisher= Pan Books|page= 224|isbn=978-0-330-49136-5}}</ref>\n\nMoving swiftly along [[Roman road]]s, Alaric sacked the cities of [[Aquileia]] and [[Cremona]] and ravaged the lands along the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The Visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to Rome in 408, but eventually the Senate granted him a substantial subsidy. In addition, he forced the Senate to liberate all 40,000 [[Goths|Gothic]] slaves in Rome. Honorius, however, refused to appoint Alaric as the commander of the Western Roman Army, and in 409 the Visigoths again surrounded Rome. Alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming [[Priscus Attalus|Attalus]] [[Western Emperor]]. Attalus appointed him [[magister utriusque militiae]] (\"master of both services\"), but refused to allow him to send an army into [[Africa]]. Negotiations with Honorius broke down, after which Alaric deposed Attalus in the summer of 410 and besieged Rome for the third time. Allies within the capital opened the gates for him on August{{nbsp}}24, and for three days his troops [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]]. Although the Visigoths plundered Rome, they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings.

To spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money, emperors began to employ units recruited from Germanic tribes.  The largest of these contingents was that of the Goths, who in 382 (376 in some sources), had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries, keeping a large degree of autonomy.\n\nIn 394 Alaric served as a leader of ''foederati'' under [[Theodosius I]] in the campaign which crushed the usurper [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]]. As the [[Battle of the Frigidus]], which terminated this campaign, was fought at the passes of the [[Julian Alps]], Alaric probably learned the weakness of [[Italy]]'s natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}}\n\nTheodosius died in 395, leaving the Empire to be divided between his two sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], the former taking [[Byzantine Empire|the eastern]] and the latter [[Western Roman Empire|the western portion]] of the Empire.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}} Arcadius showed little interest in ruling, leaving most of the actual power to his [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]]. Honorius was still a minor; as his guardian, Theodosius had appointed the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho]]. Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius, causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts.\n\nAccording to [[Edward Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns, Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies. He was denied the promotion, however. Among the Visigoths settled in Lower [[Moesia]] (now part of Bulgaria and Romania), the situation was ripe for rebellion. They had suffered disproportionately great losses at Frigidus. According to rumour, exposing the Visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes. This, combined with their post-battle rewards, prompted them to raise Alaric \"on a shield\" and proclaim him king; according to [[Jordanes]], a 6th-century Roman bureaucrat of Gothic origin who later turned his hand to history, both the new king and his people decided \"rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work, than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others.\"{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hodgkin"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "470"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hodgkin"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "470"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hodgkin"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "470"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "In Greece", "paragraphs": "[[File:Ludwig Thiersch - Alaric \u00e0 Ath\u00e8nes.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Alaric in Athens by [[Ludwig Thiersch]], 1894]]\nAlaric struck first at the eastern empire.

Instead, Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person, which only aroused suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinus was in league with the Goths. Stilicho now marched east against Alaric. According to [[Claudian]], Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths when he was ordered by Arcadius \u2013 influenced by Rufinus \u2013 to leave [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Soon after, Rufinus' own soldiers hacked him to death. Power in Constantinople now passed to the eunuch Chamberlain [[Eutropius (Byzantine official)|Eutropius]].\n\nRufinus' death and Stilicho's departure gave free rein to Alaric's movements; he ravaged [[Attica]] but spared [[Athens]], which capitulated at once to the conqueror. In 396, he wiped out the last remnants of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Mysteries at Eleusis]] in Attica, ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the [[Bronze Age]].

From there Alaric escaped with difficulty, and not without some suspicion of connivance by Stilicho, who supposedly had again received orders to depart.

After spreading desolation through northern [[Italy]] and striking terror into the citizens of Rome, Alaric was met by [[Stilicho]] at [[Pollentia]], today in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]. The [[Battle of Pollentia|battle]] which followed on April 6, 402 (coinciding with Easter), was a costly victory for Rome, but it effectively halted the Goths' progress.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nStilicho's enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival. Alaric, too, was outwardly a Christian, though an [[Arianism|Arian]] rather than [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Orthodox]], though he continued to practice the pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing Christian ritual practices.

The death of Arcadius in May 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court, but Alaric, who had actually entered Epirus, demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war, he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the \"expenses of [[mobilization]]\".

His demands were certainly grand: the concession of a block of territory 200&nbsp;miles long by 150 wide between the [[Danube]] and the Gulf of [[Venice]] (to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the Empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army. As outrageous as his terms were, the emperor would have been well-advised to grant them. Honorius, however, refused to see beyond his own safety, guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of [[Ravenna]]. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of [[Rome]] in 409, came to terms with the Senate.

Alaric, again outwitted by an enemy's machinations, marched southward, and began his third siege of Rome.

But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire, save the [[Gardens of Sallust]], which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}} The [[Basilica Aemilia]] in the [[Roman Forum]] did burn down, which perhaps can be attributed to Alaric: the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor. \n\n===Death and funeral===\n[[Image:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The burial of Alaric in the bed of the [[Busento River]]. 1895 wood engraving.]]\n\nAlaric, having penetrated the city, marched southwards into [[Calabria]].

His demands were certainly grand: the concession of a block of territory 200&nbsp;miles long by 150 wide between the [[Danube]] and the Gulf of [[Venice]] (to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the Empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army. As outrageous as his terms were, the emperor would have been well-advised to grant them. Honorius, however, refused to see beyond his own safety, guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of [[Ravenna]]. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of [[Rome]] in 409, came to terms with the Senate. With their consent, he set up a rival emperor, the prefect of the city, a Greek named [[Priscus Attalus]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hodgkin"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "471"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Third siege of Rome", "paragraphs": "{{main|Sack of Rome (410)}}\nAlaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with Honorius. These negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another Goth, [[Sarus (Goth)|Sarus]], an [[Amali]], and therefore hereditary enemy of Alaric and his house. Alaric, again outwitted by an enemy's machinations, marched southward, and began his third siege of Rome. Apparently, defense was impossible; there are hints, not well substantiated, of treachery; surprise is a more likely explanation. However, this may be\u2014for our information at this point of the story is meager\u2014on August 24, 410, Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the [[Porta Salaria]] on the northeast of the city.

But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire, save the [[Gardens of Sallust]], which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}} The [[Basilica Aemilia]] in the [[Roman Forum]] did burn down, which perhaps can be attributed to Alaric: the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor. \n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sack of Rome (410)"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hodgkin"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "471"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hodgkin"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "471"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Death and funeral", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The burial of Alaric in the bed of the [[Busento River]]. 1895 wood engraving.]]\n\nAlaric, having penetrated the city, marched southwards into [[Calabria]].
