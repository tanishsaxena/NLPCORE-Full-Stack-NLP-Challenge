Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, [[Stone Age]] people made flint, which was fashioned into drills, blades and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the 3rd century Roman [[castra]] (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, in the middle of the 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of ''Habensperch'', came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.\n\nIn 1256, the [[castrum]] of ''Abensprech'' was first mentioned, and on 12 June 1348, Margrave Ludwig of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and his brother, Duke Stephen of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], raised Abensberg to the status of a city, giving it the right to operate lower courts, enclose itself with a wall and hold markets. The wall was built by Count Ulrich III of [[County of Abensberg|Abensberg]]. Some of the thirty-two round towers and eight turrets are still preserved to this day.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the people of Abensberg enjoyed a level of autonomy above their lord. They elected a city council, although only a small number of rich families were eligible for election.\n\nIn around 1390, the Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Abensberg was founded by Count John II and his wife, Agnes. Although Abensberg was an autonomous city, it remained dependent on the powerful [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Dukes of Bavaria]]. The last Lord of Abensberg, [[Niclas, Graf von Abensberg]], supposedly named after his godfather, [[Nicholas of Kues]], a Catholic cardinal, was murdered in 1485 by Christopher, a [[Herzog|Duke]] of [[Bavaria-Munich]]. The year before, Niclas had unchivalrously taken Christopher captive as he bathed before a tournament in Munich. Although Christopher renounced his claim for revenge, he lay in wait for Niclas in Freising. When the latter arrived, he was killed by Seitz von Frauenberg. He is buried in the former convent of Abensberg. \n\nAbensberg then lost its independence and became a part of the Duchy of Bavaria, and from then on was administered by a ducal official, the so-called caretaker. The castle of Abensberg was destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]], although the city had bought a guarantee of protection from the Swedish general, [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]]. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], who had occupied Bavaria, granted the fief of Abensberg to count Ernst von [[Abensberg-Traun|Abensperg und Traun]] (1608\u20131668) from an Austrian noble family named Traun that now received the name of the former counts of Abensberg (who were believed to be distant relatives). After the occupation ended, he was however dispossessed. \n\n[[Johannes Aventinus]] (1477\u20131534) is the city's most famous son, the founder of the study of history in Bavaria. Aventinus, whose name was real name is Johann or Johannes Turmair (''Aventinus'' being the Latin name of his birthplace) wrote the ''Annals of Bavaria'', a valuable record of the early history of Germany and the first major written work on the subject. He is commemorated in the [[Walhalla temple]], a monument near [[Regensburg]] to the distinguished figures of German history. Until 1800, Abensberg was a municipality belonging to the [[Straubing]] district of the [[Electorate of Bavaria]]. Abensberg also contained a magistrates' court. In the [[Battle of Abensberg]] on 19\u201320 April 1809, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] gained a significant victory over the Austrians under Archduke [[Archduke Louis of Austria|Ludwig]] of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and General [[Johann von Hiller]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abensberg|volume=1|page=42}}</ref>\n\n===Arms===\n[[File:Wappen von Abensberg.svg|thumb|right|100px|Arms of Abensberg]]\n\nThe arms of the city are divided into two halves.

With the death of the last Count, Nicholas of Abensberg, in 1485, the estates fell to the [[Duchy of Bavaria-Munich]], meaning that henceforth only the Bavarian coat of arms was ever used.\n\nOn 31 December 1809, a decree of [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian]] of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] granted the city a new coat of arms, as a recognition of their (mainly humanitarian and logistic) services in the [[Battle of Abensberg]] the same year. The diagonally divided field in silver and black came from the old crest of the Counts of Abensberg, while the white and blue diamonds came from that of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], the rulers of Bavaria.
