Arab Christians, for example, use the terms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|All\u0101h al-ab}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628}}) for [[God the Father]], ''{{transl|ar|ALA|All\u0101h al-ibn}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0646}}) for [[Son of God|God the Son]], and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|All\u0101h al-r\u016b\u1e25 al-quds}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633}}) for [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|God the Holy Spirit]]. (See [[God in Christianity]] for the Christian concept of God.)\n\n[[Arab Christians]] have used two forms of invocations that were [[affix]]ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'', and also created their own [[Trinity|Trinitized]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'' as early as the 8th century.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> The Muslim ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'' reads: \"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\" The Trinitized ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'' reads: \"In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.\" The [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] invocations do not have the words \"One God\" at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] aspect of Trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims.<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas E.

(Even the Arabic-descended [[Maltese language]] of [[Malta]], whose population is almost entirely Roman Catholic, uses ''Alla'' for \"God\".)

(See [[God in Christianity]] for the Christian concept of God.)\n\n[[Arab Christians]] have used two forms of invocations that were [[affix]]ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'', and also created their own [[Trinity|Trinitized]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'' as early as the 8th century.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> The Muslim ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'' reads: \"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\" The Trinitized ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismill\u0101h}}'' reads: \"In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.\" The [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] invocations do not have the words \"One God\" at the end.

history of the name ''All\u0101h'' in English was probably influenced by the study of [[comparative religion]] in the 19th century; for example, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Mu\u1e25ammad (1934), [[Tor Andr\u00e6]] always used the term ''Allah'', though he allows that this \"conception of God\" seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies.<ref name=\"Watt45\">William Montgomery Watt, ''Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue'', [[Routledge]], 1983, p.45</ref>\n\nLanguages which may not commonly use the term ''Allah'' to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long [[Al-Andalus|Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula]], the word ''ojal\u00e1'' in the Spanish language and ''oxal\u00e1'' in the [[Portuguese language]] exist today, borrowed from [[Arabic]] ''[[inshalla]]'' (Arabic: \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647).
