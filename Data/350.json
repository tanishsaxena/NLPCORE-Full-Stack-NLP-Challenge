'''Jane Marple''' is an elderly [[spinster]] who lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]].

This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": "===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel)\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel)\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones.

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Filling Miss Marple's Shoes"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Phil"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Clymer"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2012-03-07"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": "Angela Lansbury", "paragraphs": "In 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel.
