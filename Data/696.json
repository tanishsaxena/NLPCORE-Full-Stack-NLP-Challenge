Agathon introduced certain innovations into the Greek theater: [[Aristotle]] tells us in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1456a) that the characters and plot of his ''[[Anthos (play)|Anthos]]'' were original and not, following Athenian dramatic orthodoxy, borrowed from mythological or historical subjects.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' 9.</ref>  Agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays.\n\nAgathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement. The [[epideictic]] speech in praise of love which Agathon recites in the ''Symposium'' is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions, and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of [[Gorgias]].  In the ''Symposium,'' Agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet Aristophanes, but this alleged friendship did not prevent Aristophanes from harshly criticizing Agathon in at least two of his comic plays: the ''Thesmophoriazousae'' and the (now lost) ''Gerytades''.  In the later play ''Frogs'', Aristophanes softens his criticisms, but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on Agathon's name (\u1f01\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 \"good\") that he makes Dionysus call him a \"good poet\".\n\nAgathon was also a friend of [[Euripides]], another recruit to the court of Archelaus of Macedon.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Oxford Classical Dictionary"}, {"name": "page", "value": "25"}, {"name": "edition", "value": "2"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Physical appearance", "paragraphs": "Agathon's extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources; the historian W.

Scholars are unsure how much of Aristophanes' portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention.\n\nAfter a close reading of the ''Thesmophoriazousae,'' the historian Jane McIntosh Snyder observed that Agathon's costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet [[Anacreon]], as he is portrayed in early 5th-century vase-paintings.  Snyder theorizes that Agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow-poet, although by Agathon's time, such clothing, especially the \u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (''kekryphalos'', an elaborate covering for the hair) had long fallen out of fashion for men.  According to this interpretation, Agathon is mocked in the ''Thesmophoriazousae'' not only for his notorious effeminacy, but also for the pretentiousness of his dress: \"he seems to think of himself, in all his elegant finery, as a rival to the old Ionian poets, perhaps even to Anacreon himself.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jane McIntosh |last=Snyder |title=Aristophanes' Agathon as Anacreon |journal=Hermes |volume=102 |year=1974 |issue=2 |pages=246 |jstor=4475842 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "W.

Poor thing! It went there, hoping--to slip across.\n\nAlthough the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries, it was probably not composed for Agathon the tragedian, nor was it composed by Plato.  Stylistic evidence suggests that the poem (with most of Plato's other alleged epigrams) was actually written some time after Plato had died: its form is that of the Hellenistic erotic epigram, which did not become popular until after 300 BC.  According to 20th-century scholar Walther Ludwig, the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of Plato sometime between 250 BC and 100 BC and adopted by later writers from this source.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Walther |last=Ludwig |title=Plato's Love Epigrams |journal=Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=1963 |pages=59\u201382 |doi= }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Walther"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Ludwig"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Plato's Love Epigrams"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "4"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1963"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "59\u201382"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Known plays", "paragraphs": "Of Agathon's plays, only six titles and thirty-one fragments have survived:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Aerope''\n*''Alcmeon''\n*''[[Anthos (play)|Anthos]]'' or ''Antheus'' (\"The Flower\")\n*''Mysoi'' (\"Mysians\")\n*''Telephos'' (\"[[Telephus]]\")\n*''Thyestes''\n{{div col end}}\n\nFragments in [[Johann August Nauck|A Nauck]], ''Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta'' (1887).\nFragments in Greek with English translations in Matthew Wright's \"The Lost Plays of Greek Tragedy (Volume 1)\nNeglected Authors\" (2016)\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "div col", "values": [{"name": "colwidth", "value": "30em"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Quotations", "paragraphs": "* \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9,<br>\u1f00\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f05\u03c3\u03c3\u1fbd \u1f02\u03bd \u1f96 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1.\n** Even God cannot change the past.\n** As quoted in [[Aristotle]], ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Book VI, sect. 2, 1139b\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "*[[List of speakers in Plato's dialogues]]\n*[[Symposium (painting)]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 6}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*''The Drama: Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization'', volume 1, by Alfred Bates.
