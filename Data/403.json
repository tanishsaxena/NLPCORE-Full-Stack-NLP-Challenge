The Lesser Caucasus range extends through northern Armenia, runs southeast between [[Lake Sevan]] and Azerbaijan, then passes roughly along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to Iran. Thus situated, the mountains make travel from north to south difficult. Geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes, which have plagued Armenia. In December 1988, the second largest city in the republic, Leninakan (now [[Gyumri]]), was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25,000 people.\n\nAbout half of Armenia's area of approximately {{convert|29,743|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} has an elevation of at least {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and only 3% of the country lies below {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The lowest points are in the valleys of the [[Aras (river)|Araks River]] and the [[Debed|Debed River]] in the far north, which have elevations of {{convert|380|and|430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Elevations in the Lesser Caucasus vary between {{convert|2640|and|3280|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. To the southwest of the range is the Armenian Plateau, which slopes southwestward toward the Araks River on the Turkish border. The plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes. The largest of these, [[Mount Aragats]], {{convert|4090|m|ft|0|sp=us|abbr=}} high, is also the highest point in Armenia. Most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country, where the two major cities, [[Yerevan]] and [[Gyumri]], are located.\n\nThe valleys of the Debed and [[Aghstafa (river)|Akstafa]] rivers form the chief routes into Armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains. [[Lake Sevan]], {{convert|72.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} across at its widest point and {{convert|376|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long, is by far the largest lake.

Most of Armenia is drained by the [[Araks]] or its tributary, the [[Hrazdan]], which flows from Lake Sevan. The Araks forms most of Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran while the [[Zangezur Mountains]] form the border between Armenia's southern [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]] and Azerbaijan's adjacent Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n[[Image:Armenian terrain.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Armenian terrain]]\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Rivers and lakes of Armenia"}]}, {"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Mountains of Armenia"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "29,743"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "sqmi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "4", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "650"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "4", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "380"}, {"name": "2", "value": "and"}, {"name": "3", "value": "430"}, {"name": "4", "value": "m"}, {"name": "5", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "6", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2640"}, {"name": "2", "value": "and"}, {"name": "3", "value": "3280"}, {"name": "4", "value": "m"}, {"name": "5", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "6", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "4090"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "4", "value": "0"}, {"name": "sp", "value": "us"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "72.5"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km"}, {"name": "3", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "376"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km"}, {"name": "3", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1900"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "4", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1279.18"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "sqmi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.armstat.am/file/article/eco_booklet_2018.doc.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS OF ARMENIA FOR 2018 AND TIME-SERIES OF INDICATORS FOR 2014-2018"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "7.5"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "sqmi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "sqmi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0.8"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "sqmi"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Climate", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Climate of Armenia}}\n\nTemperatures in Armenia generally depend upon elevation.

Environmental issues helped form the basis of the nationalist independence movement when environmental demonstrations subsequently merged with those for other political causes in the late 1980s.  By 1980 the infrequency of sightings of Mount Ararat, which looms about sixty kilometers across the closed Turkish border, became a symbol of worsening air pollution in Yerevan.\n\nPollution from toxic chemicals such as [[DDT]] has not helped the already poor soil quality in many parts of the country.\n\nArmenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a [[Ministry of Environment (Armenia)|Ministry of Environment]] and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities.
