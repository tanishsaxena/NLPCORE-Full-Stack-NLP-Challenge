In France, the acre (spelled exactly the same as in English) was used only in [[Normandy]], but its value varied greatly across Normandy, ranging from 3,632 to 9,725&nbsp;square metres, with 8,172&nbsp;square metres being the most frequent value. The Normandy ''acre'' was usually divided in 4 ''verg\u00e9es'' ([[Rood (unit)|roods]]) and 160 square ''perches'', like the English acre.\n\nThe Normandy ''acre'' was equal to 1.6 ''[[arpent]]s'', the unit of area more commonly used in Northern France outside of Normandy. In Canada, the Paris ''arpent'' used in [[Quebec]] before the metric system was adopted is sometimes called \"French acre\" in English, even though the Paris ''arpent'' and the Normandy ''acre'' were two very different units of area in ancient France (the Paris ''arpent'' became the unit of area of French Canada, whereas the Normandy ''acre'' was never used in French Canada).\n\nIn Germany there were many variants of the ''Acker'', differing between the German states:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000&nbsp;acres of land, not 50&nbsp;square miles of land.\n\nThe acre is related to the square mile, with 640&nbsp;acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280&nbsp;feet (1760&nbsp;yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of {{frac|1|2}} mile (880&nbsp;yards) and is {{frac|1|4}} square mile in area, or 160&nbsp;acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being {{frac|1|4}} mile long, and being {{frac|1|16}} of a square mile in area, or 40&nbsp;acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase \"the back 40\" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the [[Canadian Prairie Provinces]] and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ang"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6cer"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "no"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6kre"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "sv"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e5ker"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "de"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Acker"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "nl"}, {"name": "2", "value": "akker"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "la"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ager"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "sa-Latn"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ajr"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "el"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "el-Latn"}, {"name": "2", "value": "agros"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "Great Britain"}, {"name": "author2", "value": "Owen Ruffhead"}, {"name": "authorlink2", "value": "Owen Ruffhead"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Statutes at Large"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Un1RAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA421&q=%22quod%20tria%20grana%22#v=snippet&q=%22quod%20tria%20grana%22&f=false"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "12 February 2012"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1765"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Printed by M.
