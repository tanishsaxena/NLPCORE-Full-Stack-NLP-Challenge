Abraham is called by [[El Shaddai|God]] to leave the house of his father [[Terah]] and settle in the land originally given to [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]] but which God now promises to Abraham and [[Abraham's family tree|his progeny]]. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to [[Ishmael]] about founding a great nation, [[Isaac]], Abraham's son by his half-sister [[Sarah]], inherits God's promises to Abraham. Abraham purchases a tomb (the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]) at [[Hebron]] to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the [[Canaan]]ites out of any inheritance. Abraham later marries [[Keturah]] and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives \"all Abraham's goods\", while the other sons receive only \"gifts\" (Genesis 25:5\u20138).{{sfn|Ska|2009|pp=26\u201331}}\n\nThe Abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time, and it is widely agreed that the [[patriarchal age]], along with the [[The Exodus|exodus]] and the period of the [[Biblical judges|judges]], is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history.{{sfn|McNutt|1999|pp=41\u201342}} A common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early Persian period (late 6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in [[Yehud Medinata|Judah]] during the [[Babylonian captivity]] and traced their right to the land through their \"father Abraham\", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on [[Moses]] and [[the Exodus]] tradition.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=227\u2013228, 260}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "pp", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Biblical patriarch"}]}, {"name": "redirect-multi", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "4"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Abram"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Avraham"}, {"name": "4", "value": "Avram"}, {"name": "5", "value": "Ibrahim"}, {"name": "6", "value": "other uses"}, {"name": "7", "value": "Abraham (disambiguation)"}, {"name": "8", "value": "and"}, {"name": "9", "value": "Abram (disambiguation)"}, {"name": "10", "value": "and"}, {"name": "11", "value": "Avraham (disambiguation)"}, {"name": "12", "value": "and"}, {"name": "13", "value": "Avram (disambiguation)"}, {"name": "14", "value": "and"}, {"name": "15", "value": "Ibrahim (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2012"}]}, {"name": "Infobox character\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Abraham"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Rembrandt Abraham Serving the Three Angels.jpg"}, {"name": "image_upright", "value": "1.3"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "''[[Abraham Serving the Three Angels]]'', by [[Rembrandt]], 1646"}, {"name": "family", "value": "''[[Abraham's family tree]]''"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "{{plainlist|\n*[[Sarah]]\n*[[Hagar]]\n*[[Keturah]]}}"}, {"name": "relatives", "value": "{{plainlist|\n*[[Terah]] (father)\n*[[Sarah]] (half-sister and wife)\n*[[Haran]] (brother)\n*[[Nahor, son of Terah|Nahor]] (brother)\n*[[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] (nephew)\n*[[Lot's wife]] (niece)}}"}, {"name": "children", "value": "{{plainlist|\n*[[Ishmael]]\n*[[Isaac]]\n*[[Zimran]]\n*[[Jokshan]]\n*[[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medan]]\n*[[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]]\n*[[Ishbak]]\n*[[Shuah]]}}"}, {"name": "lbl21", "value": "Birth name"}, {"name": "data21", "value": "Abram"}, {"name": "lbl22", "value": "Birthplace"}, {"name": "data22", "value": "[[Ur of the Chaldees|Ur Ka\u015bdim]], [[Mesopotamia]]"}, {"name": "lbl24", "value": "Death place"}, {"name": "data24", "value": "[[Hebron]], [[Canaan]]"}, {"name": "lbl25", "value": "Resting place"}, {"name": "data25", "value": "[[Cave of the Patriarchs|Cave of Machpelah]]"}, {"name": "lbl31", "value": "Resting place coordinates"}, {"name": "data31", "value": "{{coord|31.524744|35.110726|type:landmark|display=inline|format=dms}}"}, {"name": "lbl32", "value": "Influenced"}, {"name": "data32", "value": "[[Abrahamic religions]]"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "*[[Sarah]]\n*[[Hagar]]\n*[[Keturah]]"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "*[[Terah]] (father)\n*[[Sarah]] (half-sister and wife)\n*[[Haran]] (brother)\n*[[Nahor, son of Terah|Nahor]] (brother)\n*[[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] (nephew)\n*[[Lot's wife]] (niece)"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "*[[Ishmael]]\n*[[Isaac]]\n*[[Zimran]]\n*[[Jokshan]]\n*[[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medan]]\n*[[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]]\n*[[Ishbak]]\n*[[Shuah]]"}]}, {"name": "coord", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "31.524744"}, {"name": "2", "value": "35.110726"}, {"name": "3", "value": "type:landmark"}, {"name": "display", "value": "inline"}, {"name": "format", "value": "dms"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|e\u026a|b|r|\u0259|h|\u00e6|m|,_|-|h|\u0259|m}};

The [[Abraham's family tree|entire family]], including grandchildren, lived in [[Ur of the Chaldees]]. According to a [[midrash]], Abram worked in [[Abraham and the Idol Shop|Terah's idol shop]] in his youth. Haran was the father of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], and thus Lot was Abram's nephew. Haran died in his native city, Ur of the Chaldees.\n\nAbram married [[Sarah|Sarah (Sarai)]], who was barren. Terah, with<!-- NOT Nahor,--> Abram, Sarai, and Lot, then departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]], where Terah died at the age of 205.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:27\u201332|niv}} God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:1\u20133|niv}} Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to [[Shechem]] in [[Canaan]].{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:4\u20136|niv}}\n\n[[File:Tissot Abram's Counsel to Sarai.jpg|thumb|left|''Abraham's Counsel to Sarai'', watercolor by [[James Tissot]], {{circa|1900}} ([[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]], New York)]]\n\n===Sarai===\nThere was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, traveled to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].

This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict amongst brethren. Lot chose to go eastward to the plain of [[Jordan River|Jordan]] where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. Abram went south to [[Hebron]] and settled in the plain of [[Mamre]], where he built another altar to worship [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]].<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246613/jewish/Abram-and-Lot.htm \"Abram and Lot Separate\", Chabad.org]</ref>\n\n===Chedorlaomer===\n{{Main|Battle of Siddim}}\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'', canvas by [[Dieric Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]], c. 1464\u20131467]]\n\nDuring the rebellion of the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Jordan River cities]] against [[Elam]],{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:1\u20139|niv}} Abram's nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading [[Elam]]ite forces. The Elamite army came to collect the spoils of war, after having just defeated the king of Sodom's armies.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:8\u201312|niv}} Lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Kingdom of Sodom]] which made them a visible target.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:12|niv}}\n\nOne person who escaped capture came and told Abram what happened. Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram's force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim|Battle of Siddim]]. When they caught up with them at [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King [[Chedorlaomer]] at Hobah, just north of [[Damascus]]. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:13\u201316|niv}}\n\nUpon Abram's return, Sodom's king came out to meet with him in the [[King's dale|Valley of Shaveh]], the \"king's dale\". Also, [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem ([[Jerusalem]]), a priest of [[Elyon|God Most High]], brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a [[tithe|tenth]] of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people.

Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaiden, [[Hagar]], to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son.\n\nAfter Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Sarai responded by mistreating Hagar, and Hagar fled into the wilderness. An angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain on the way to [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]. He instructed her to return to the camp of Abram, and that her son would be \"a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.\" She was told to call her son [[Ishmael]]. Hagar then called God who spoke to her \"[[El Roi|El-roi]]\", (\"Thou God seest me:\" KJV). From that day onward, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi, (\"The well of him that liveth and seeth me.\" KJV margin). She then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child. Abram was 86 years of age when Ishmael was born.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|16:4\u201316|niv}}\n\n===Sarah===\nThirteen years later, when Abram was 99 years of age, God declared Abram's new name: \"Abraham\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"a father of many nations\".{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:5|niv}} Abraham then received the instructions for the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]], of which [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]] was to be the sign.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:10\u201314|niv}}\n\nGod declared Sarai's new name: \"[[Sarah]]\", blessed her, and told Abraham, \"I will give thee a son also of her\".{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:15\u201316|niv}} Abraham laughed, and \"said in his heart, 'Shall a ''child'' be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?'\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:17|niv}} Immediately after Abraham's encounter with God, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and Ishmael (age 13), circumcised.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:22\u201327|niv}}\n\n===Three visitors===\n[[File:Tissot Abraham and the Three Angels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Abraham and the Three Angels'', watercolor by [[James Tissot]], {{circa|1896\u20131902}}]]\n{{main|Abraham Serving the Three Angels}}\nNot long afterward, during the heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the [[Pistacia palaestina|terebinths]] of [[Mamre]]. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and [[Bowing (social)|bowed]] to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to [[Sarah]]'s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|18:1\u20138|niv}}\n\nOne of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages.

Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.\n\n===Abraham's plea===\n{{main|Sodom and Gomorrah|Lot (biblical person)}}\n[[File:Tissot Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames'', watercolor by [[James Tissot]], {{circa|1896\u20131902}}]]\n\nAfter eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the 'cities of the plain' to discuss the fate of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that \"if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?\" For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|18:17\u201333|niv}}\n\nWhen the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham's nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two \"men\" stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot's home and demanded that Lot bring out his guests so that they may \"know\" (v.5) them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not \"known\" (v.8) man to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lot's door to get to his male guests,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:1\u20139|niv}} thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:12\u201313|niv}}\n\nEarly the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he stood before God. He \"looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah\" and saw what became of the cities of the plain, where not even \"ten righteous\" (v.18:32) had been found, as \"the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:27\u201329|niv}}\n\n===Abimelech===\n[[File:Tissot The Caravan of Abraham.jpg|thumb|''The Caravan of Abraham'', watercolor by [[James Tissot]], before 1903 ([[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]], New York)]]\n\n{{see also|Endogamy|Wife\u2013sister narratives in the Book of Genesis}}\nAbraham settled between [[Kadesh (South of Israel)|Kadesh]] and [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] in the land of the [[Philistine]]s. While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King [[Abimelech]] had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:1\u20137|niv}}\n\nEarly next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: \"And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:12||Genesis 20:12|niv}} Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands.

Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of [[Abraham's well]]. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: [[Beersheba]]. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to [[Philistia]], Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called upon \"the name of the {{LORD}}, the everlasting God.\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:22\u201334||Genesis 21:22\u201334|niv}}\n\n===Isaac===\n[[File:Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.jpg|thumb|Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac, from an [[East Anglian]] [[missal]], {{circa|1315}} ([[National Library of Wales]], Aberystwyth)]]\n[[File:Sacrifice of Isaac-Caravaggio (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|''Sacrifice of Isaac'', by [[Caravaggio]], {{circa|1603}} ([[Uffizi]], Florence)]]\n\nAs had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:21|niv}} Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision.

Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded.

Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied \"God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering\". Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by the angel of the Lord, and he saw behind him a \"ram caught in a thicket by his horns\", which he sacrificed instead of his son. For his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity.
