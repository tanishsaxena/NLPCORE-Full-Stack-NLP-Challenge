Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]).  Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas)  and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary.  This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s.  The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south.  Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt.  Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe.  Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities.  Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]].  [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population.  They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg.  This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different.  Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands.  However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies.  Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada.

In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year.  By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions.  By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "History of Alberta"}, {"name": "2", "value": "History of the petroleum industry in Canada"}]}], "id": 11}, {"title": "Employment", "paragraphs": "\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Job market trends and profiles |work=Alberta| access-date = September 9, 2019| date = 2018| url = https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190909182248/https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-09-09 }}</ref> Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314172259/http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | archive-date=March 14, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\">{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015\u201316 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201425,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta  |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282-0008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used.  [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]].  Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections |date=August 2006 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815131438/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |archive-date=2011-08-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.\n\nEdmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: [[Canadian Western Bank]], and [[ATB Financial]], as well as the only province-wide [[credit union]], [[Servus]].\n\n====Government====\nDespite Alberta's reputation as a \"small government\" province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues. In 2014 the median household income in Alberta was $100,000 with the average weekly wage at $1,163\u201423 per cent higher than the Canadian national average.<ref name=\"CBC_2015_wages\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alberta-wages-almost-25-higher-than-canadian-average-1.2981768 | title=Alberta wages almost 25% higher than Canadian average: Economists, politicians and business leaders seek ways to bring wages down | publisher=CBC | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | author=Johnson, Tracy}}</ref>\n\nIn their May 2018 report co-authored by [[C.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282-0008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.
