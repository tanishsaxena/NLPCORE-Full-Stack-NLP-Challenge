Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean.

It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These \"Fatimids\" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them.

The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids).

Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The [[Fatimid]] state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu'izz, also found another means of revenge.\n\nBetween the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[Maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the [[Fatimid]] treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.\n\nWhole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gab\u00e8s Governorate|Gabe]]s region. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the field.\n\nThe flood was still rising, and in 1057, the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they gradually choked [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]], as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago.

In 1516 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the ''Bani Ziyad'' dynasty, to flee. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).<ref name=\"csa16\" /><ref name=Mikaberidze/>\n\n[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]\n\nThe next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\n[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa.

It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\nThe dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671\u20131830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottoman government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].<ref name=\"csa16\">{{cite web|title=Algeria&nbsp;\u2013 Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies|access-date=4 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014191245/http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Debarquement et maltraitement de prisonniers a alger.JPG|thumb|[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Christian slaves]] in Algiers, 1706]]\n\nThe [[Barbary pirates]] preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea.<ref name= \"Davis\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500\u20131800|author=Robert Davis|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003|isbn=978-0-333-71966-4|access-date=24 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326072557/https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C|archive-date=26 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as [[slavery|slaves]].<ref name = britannica>{{cite web|url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html |title=Barbary Pirates\u2014Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives.

Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.\n{{multiple image|\n|image1=GM Massinissa.png\n|caption1=[[Masinissa]] (c.&nbsp;238\u2013148&nbsp;BC), first king of Numidia\n|image2=Jugurtha.JPG\n|caption2=[[Jugurtha]] (c.&nbsp;160\u2013104&nbsp;BC), king of Numidia\n}}\n\nBy the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army.

As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.\n[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Numidia]] along with [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]], [[Roman Republic|Rome]], and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] 200 BC]]\nAfter Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Algeria), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].

The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th.

It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These \"Fatimids\" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|T\u0101ghrib\u0101t]].

The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101203234/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009220925/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |archive-date=9 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara \u2013 Les Almoravides (1056\u20131147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921185314/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |archivedate=21 September 2013  }}</ref> Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.\n\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|left|Fatimid Caliphate, a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] dynasty that ruled much of North Africa, c. 960\u20131100]]\n\nThe [[Berber people|Amazighs]] historically consisted of several tribes.

Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The [[Fatimid]] state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu'izz, also found another means of revenge.\n\nBetween the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[Maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the [[Fatimid]] treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.\n\nWhole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gab\u00e8s Governorate|Gabe]]s region. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the field.\n\nThe flood was still rising, and in 1057, the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they gradually choked [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]], as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some were forcibly taken by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. We can say that in the 13th century the Arabs were in all of [[North Africa]], with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions which remained entirely Berber.{{Citation needed|reason=Verification needed for 13th century comment that \"Arabs were in all of North Africa\" and also verification of events that occurred on and after 1057 A.D. .|date=March 2019}} The influx of [[Bedouin]] tribes was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural [[Arabization]] of the Maghreb and in the spread of [[nomad]]ism in areas where [[agriculture]] had previously been dominant.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://muslimheritage.com/the-great-mosque-of-tlemcen/ |title = The Great Mosque of Tlemcen|website = MuslimHeritage.com|publisher = Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization}}</ref> [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by [[Banu Hilal]] tribes had become completely arid desert.<ref>[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm ''Populations Crises and Population Cycles''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=27 May 2013 }}, Claire Russell and W.

Tlemcen|Zayyanid kingdom]] of Tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors]]\n\nThe region of Algeria was partially ruled by [[Ottomans]] for three centuries from 1516 to 1830. In 1516 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the ''Bani Ziyad'' dynasty, to flee. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).<ref name=\"csa16\" /><ref name=Mikaberidze/>\n\n[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]\n\nThe next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\n[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620\u201321, and suffered high fatalities in 1654\u201357, 1665, 1691 and 1740\u201342.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\nIn 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[Dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty nobles. It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\nThe dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671\u20131830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottoman government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].<ref name=\"csa16\">{{cite web|title=Algeria&nbsp;\u2013 Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies|access-date=4 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014191245/http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Debarquement et maltraitement de prisonniers a alger.JPG|thumb|[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Christian slaves]] in Algiers, 1706]]\n\nThe [[Barbary pirates]] preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea.<ref name= \"Davis\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500\u20131800|author=Robert Davis|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003|isbn=978-0-333-71966-4|access-date=24 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326072557/https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C|archive-date=26 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as [[slavery|slaves]].<ref name = britannica>{{cite web|url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html |title=Barbary Pirates\u2014Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives.

But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.<ref name=\"faco\" />\n\nThe Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|accessdate=10 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725163300/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|archive-date=25 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system.
