Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from [[ancient warfare|ancient]] to [[modern warfare]]. In the 20th century, an ambush  might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a [[mountain pass]], or a small [[Irregular military|irregular]] band or [[insurgent]] group attacking a [[Regular army|regular]] armed force patrol. Theoretically, a single well-armed and concealed soldier could ambush other troops in a surprise attack.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Other uses", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ambush (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "More citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "August 2007"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "The use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bunn|first=Henry T.|author2=Alia N.

[[Hannibal]] encamped within striking distance of the Romans with the Trebia River between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. He had noticed, says [[Polybius]], a \"place between the two camps, flat indeed and treeless, but well adapted for an ambuscade, as it was traversed by a water-course with steep banks, densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants, and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy\". When the Roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army, the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear. The result was slaughter and defeat for the Romans. Nevertheless, the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force. Although most of the legions were lost, about 10,000 Romans cut their way through to safety, maintaining [[unit cohesion]]. This ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a [[kill zone]] is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation. (See Ranger reference below).\n\nAmbushes were widely utilized by the [[Lusitanians]], in particular by their chieftain [[Viriathus]]. Their usual tactic, called ''concursare'', involved repeatedly charging and retreating, forcing the enemy to eventually give them chase, in order to set up ambushes in difficult terrain where allied forces would be awaiting. In his first victory, he eluded the siege of Roman praetor Gaius Vetilius and attracted him to a narrow pass next to the [[Guadiaro (river)|Barbesuda]] river, where he destroyed his army and killed the praetor. Viriathus's ability to turn chases into ambushes would grant him victories over a number of Roman generals. Another famous Lusitanian ambush was performed by [[Curius and Apuleius]] on Roman general [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus (consul 142 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus]], who led a numerically superior army complete with [[Roman war elephants|war elephants]] and [[Numidian cavalry]]. The ambush allowed Curius and Apuleius to steal Servilianus's loot train, although a tactic error in their retreat led to the Romans retaking the train and putting the Lusitanians to flight. Viriathus later defeated Servilianus with a [[surprise attack]].<ref name=Hina>{{cite book|author=Benjam\u00edn Collado Hinarejos|title=Guerreros de Iberia: La guerra antigua en la pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica|url=|date=2018|publisher=La Esfera de los Libros|isbn=978-84-916437-9-1|page=|language= Spanish}}</ref>{{pn|date=August 2019}}\n\nPossibly the most famous ambush in ancient warfare was that sprung by Germanic warchief [[Arminius]] against the Romans at [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. This particular ambush was to affect the course of Western history. The Germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush. They took cover in difficult forested terrain, allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection. They had the element of surprise, and this was also aided by the defection of Arminius from Roman ranks prior to the battle. They sprang the attack when the Romans were most vulnerable; when they had left their fortified camp, and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm.\n\nThe Germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly, using a massive series of short, rapid, vicious charges against the length of the whole Roman line, with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place. The Germans also used blocking obstacles, erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder Roman movement along the route of the killing zone. The result was mass slaughter of the Romans, and the destruction of three legions. The Germanic victory caused a limit on Roman expansion in the West. Ultimately, it established the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the Roman influence in the West. The Roman Empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer Germania beyond the Rhine.\n\n===Arabia during Muhammad's era===\n{{Main|List of battles of Muhammad}}\nAccording to Muslim tradition, Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] used ambush tactics in his military campaigns. His first such use was during the [[Caravan raids]], in the Kharrar caravan raid Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas was ordered to lead a raid against the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]]. His group consisted of about twenty Muhajirs. This raid was done about a month after the previous. Sa'd, with his soldiers, set up an ambush in the valley of [[Kharrar]] on the road to Mecca and waited to raid a returning Meccan caravan from Syria.
