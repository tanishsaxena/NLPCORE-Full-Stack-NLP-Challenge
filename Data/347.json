For example, in an analog [[audio signal]], the instantaneous [[voltage]] of the signal varies continuously with the [[Sound pressure|pressure]] of the sound waves. It differs from a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]], in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete values]] which can only take on one of a finite number of values.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm|title=Digital signals|publisher=University of St. Andrews |author=Jim Lesurf |access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals|title=Analog vs. Digital|publisher=Sparkfun |date=2018-02-18}}</ref>  The term ''analog signal'' usually refers to [[electrical signal]]s; however, [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]], [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2013"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2018"}]}, {"name": "Broader", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Signal"}]}, {"name": "refimprove", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Digital signals"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of St. Andrews"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Jim Lesurf"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-02-18"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Analog vs. Digital"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Sparkfun"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2018-02-18"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Representation", "paragraphs": "An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information.

The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a [[transducer]].   For example, sound striking the diaphragm of a [[microphone]] induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone or the voltage produced by a [[condenser microphone]].  The voltage or the current is said to be an \"analog\" of the sound.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "specify", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2018"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Noise", "paragraphs": "{{See also|Comparison of analog and digital recording}}\nAn analog signal is subject to [[Noise (electronic)|electronic noise]] and [[distortion]] introduced by [[communication channel]]s and [[signal processing]] operations, which can progressively degrade the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR).  In contrast, digital signals have a finite resolution.  Converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a low-level [[quantization noise]] into the signal, but once in digital form the signal can be processed or transmitted without introducing significant additional noise or distortion. In analog systems, it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs.  However, in digital systems, degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well.\n\nThe most serious disadvantage of analog signals compared to digital transmission is that analog transmissions always contain [[Noise (physics)|noise]]. As the signal is copied, transmitted, or processed, the unavoidable noise introduced in the signal path will accumulate as a [[generation loss]], progressively and irreversibly degrading the signal-to-noise ratio, until in extreme cases, the signal can be overwhelmed. Noise can show up as \"hiss\" and [[intermodulation distortion]] in audio signals, or \"snow\" in video signals. Generation loss is irreversible as there is no reliable method to distinguish the noise from the signal, partly because amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well. Digital signals can be transmitted, stored and processed without introducing noise. \n\nIn electrical analog signals, noise can be minimized by shielding, good connections and the use of certain cable types such as [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] or [[twisted pair]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Comparison of analog and digital recording"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Analog computer]]\n* [[Analog device]]\n* [[Analog recording]]\n* [[Analog signal processing]]\n* [[Analog video]]\n* [[Analog-to-digital converter]]\n* [[Digital audio]]\n* [[Digital video]]\n* [[Magnetic tape]]\n* [[Videotape]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "div col", "values": [{"name": "colwidth", "value": "20em"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Analog Signal}}\n[[Category:Analog circuits]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Video signal]]", "attributes": [], "id": 4}]}
