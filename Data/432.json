Much of his work is rooted in the landscape, history and folklore of his native county of [[Cheshire]], [[North West England]], being set in the region and making use of the native [[Cheshire dialect]].\n\nBorn in [[Congleton]], Garner grew up around the nearby town of [[Alderley Edge]], and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as \"The Edge\", where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region. Studying at [[Manchester Grammar School]] and then briefly at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], in 1957 he moved to the village of Blackden, where he bought and renovated an Early Modern Period (circa 1590) building known as Toad Hall. His first novel, ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'', was published in 1960. A children's fantasy novel set on the Edge, it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters. Garner completed a sequel, ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]'' (1963), but left the third book of the trilogy he had envisioned. Instead he wrote several fantasy novels, ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967) and ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]'' (1973).\n\nTurning away from fantasy as a genre, Garner produced ''[[The Stone Book Quartet]]'' (1979), a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family. He also published a series of British folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled ''Alan Garner's Fairy Tales of Gold'' (1979), ''Alan Garner's Book of British Fairy Tales'' (1984) and ''A Bag of Moonshine'' (1986). In his subsequent novels, ''[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]'' (1996) and ''[[Thursbitch (novel)|Thursbitch]]'' (2003), he continued writing tales revolving around Cheshire, although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work. In 2012, he finally published a third book in the Weirdstone trilogy, ''[[Boneland]]''.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "other people", "values": [{"name": "2", "value": "Alan Garner (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "EngvarB", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2014"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2014"}]}, {"name": "Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n", "values": [{"name": "honorific_suffix", "value": "{{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE|FRSL}}"}, {"name": "name", "value": "Alan Garner"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alan Garner.JPG"}, {"name": "imagesize", "value": "200px"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Garner in 2011"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date and age|df=y|1934|10|17}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Congleton]], [[Cheshire]], England"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "Griselda Garner"}, {"name": "occupation", "value": "Writer, [[folklore|folklorist]]"}, {"name": "period", "value": "1960\u2013present <!-- Weirdstone publication date -->"}, {"name": "genre", "value": "[[Children's literature|Children's]] [[fantasy]], [[low fantasy]], folklore"}, {"name": "notableworks", "value": "{{plainlist|\n* ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]''\n* ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''\n* ''[[Elidor]]''\n* ''[[The Owl Service]]''\n}}"}, {"name": "awards", "value": "{{awd|[[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]]|1967}} {{awd|[[Guardian Prize]]|1968}}"}, {"name": "signature", "value": "Alan Garner signature.svg"}]}, {"name": "postnominals", "values": [{"name": "country", "value": "GBR"}, {"name": "size", "value": "100%"}, {"name": "1", "value": "OBE"}, {"name": "2", "value": "FRSL"}]}, {"name": "birth date and age", "values": [{"name": "df", "value": "y"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1934"}, {"name": "2", "value": "10"}, {"name": "3", "value": "17"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "* ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]''\n* ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''\n* ''[[Elidor]]''\n* ''[[The Owl Service]]''"}]}, {"name": "awd", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1967"}]}, {"name": "awd", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Guardian Prize]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1968"}]}, {"name": "postnominals", "values": [{"name": "country", "value": "GBR"}, {"name": "size", "value": "100%"}, {"name": "1", "value": "OBE"}, {"name": "2", "value": "FRSL"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Biography", "paragraphs": "\n===Early life: 1934\u201356===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|\"I had to get aback [to familial ways of doing things], by using skills that had been denied to my ancestors; but I had nothing that they would have called worthwhile.

Instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about The Edge.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Garner later remarked that as a result he was \"aware of [the Edge's] magic\" as a child, and he and his friends often played there.{{sfn|Garner|2010|p=9}} The story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life, becoming, he explained, \"deeply embedded in my psyche\" and heavily influencing his later novels.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner faced several life-threatening childhood illnesses, which left him bed ridden for much of the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} He attended a local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native [[Cheshire dialect]];{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=11}} for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} Garner then won a place at [[Manchester Grammar School]], where he received his secondary education; entry was [[Means test#United Kingdom|means-tested]], resulting in his school fees being waived.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]].{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=12}} He used to go jogging along the highway, and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician [[Alan Turing]], who shared his fascination with the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garner |first=Alan |title=My hero: Alan Turing |date=11 November 2011 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/11/alan-turing-my-hero-alan-garner |accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref> Garner was then conscripted into [[national service]], serving for a time with the [[Royal Artillery]] while posted to [[Woolwich]] in [[South East (London sub region)|Southeast London]].{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}}\n\nAt school, Garner had developed a keen interest in the work of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Homer]], as well as the [[Ancient Greek language]].{{sfn|Garth|2013}} Thus, he decided to pursue the study of [[Classics]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his \"cultural background\" and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who \"could not cope with me, and I could not cope with\" them.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Looking back, he remarked, \"I soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs\".{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of [[Mark Antony]] in a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' where he co-starred alongside [[Dudley Moore]] and where [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] was the stage manager.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained \"a permanent strength through all my life\".{{sfn|Garth|2013}}\n\n===''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' and ''The Moon of Gomrath'': 1957\u201364===\n\nAged 22, Garner was out cycling when he came across a hand-painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in Toad Hall &ndash; a Late Medieval building situated in Blackden, seven miles from Alderley Edge &ndash; was on sale for \u00a3510. Although he personally could not afford it, he was lent the money by the local [[Oddfellow]] lodge, enabling him to purchase and move into the cottage in June 1957.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackden Trust|1y=2008|2a1=Pitts|2a2=Garner|2y=2014|2p=14}} In the late nineteenth century the Hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers' cottages, but Garner was able to purchase the second for \u00a3150 about a year later; he proceeded to knock down the dividing walls and convert both halves back into a single home.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackden Trust|1y=2008|2a1=Pitts|2a2=Garner|2y=2014|2p=14}}\n\n[[File:Toad Hall at Blackden.JPG|thumb|left|In 1957, Garner purchased and began renovating Toad Hall at Blackden, Cheshire]]\n\nGarner had begun writing his first novel, ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen|The Weirdstone of Brisingamen: A Tale of Alderley]]'', in September 1956.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=12}} However it was while at Toad Hall that he finished the book. Set in Alderley Edge, it revolved around two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to live in the area with their mother's old nurse maid, Bess, and her husband, Gowther Mossock. Setting about to explore the Edge, they discover a race of malevolent creatures, the ''svart alfar'', who dwell in the Edge's abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them, until they are rescued by the wizard Cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are massing at the Edge in search of the eponymous \"weirdstone of Brisingamen\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|pp=12&ndash;13}} Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that \"I couldn't write and teach; the energies were too similar\", and so began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner sent his debut novel to the publishing company [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], where it was picked up by the company's head, Sir William Collins, who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954\u201355).{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} Garner, who went on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that \"Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} On its release in 1960, ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' proved to be a critical and commercial success,{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Lake|2y=2010|2pp=316&ndash;317}} later being described as \"a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|pp=316\u2013317}} Garner himself however would later denounce this novel as \"a fairly bad book\" in 1968.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=23}}\n\nWith his first book published, Garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter, living a \"hand to mouth\" lifestyle on a \"shoestring\" budget.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} He also worked on a sequel to ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'', which would be known as ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''. ''The Moon of Gomrath'' also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan, with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the [[Brollachan]] who has recently entered the world. With the help of the wizard Cadellin, the Brollachan is exorcised, but Susan's soul also leaves her body, being sent to another dimension, leading Colin to find a way to bring it back.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} Critic Neil Philip characterised it as \"an artistic advance\" but \"a less satisfying story\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} In a 1989 interview, Garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan, envisioning a trilogy, but that he had intentionally decided not to write it, instead moving on to write something different.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} However ''[[Boneland]]'', the conclusion to the sequence, was belatedly published in August 2012.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/15/alan-garner-weirdstone-brisingamen-trilogy-boneland \"Alan Garner to conclude Weirdstone of Brisingamen trilogy\"].

Inspired by this design, he produced his fourth novel, ''[[The Owl Service]]''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} The story was also heavily influenced by the Medieval Welsh tale of [[Math fab Mathonwy]] from, the ''[[Mabinogion]]''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} ''The Owl Service'' was critically acclaimed, winning both the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]].{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} It also sparked discussions among critics as to whether Garner should properly be considered a children's writer, given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}}\n\nIt took Garner six years to write his next novel, ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}} In this, he provided three intertwined love stories, one set in the present, another during the [[English Civil War]], and the third in the second century CE.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}} Philip referred to it as \"a complex book but not a complicated one: the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\nAcademic specialist in children's literature [[Maria Nikolajeva]] characterised ''Red Shift'' as \"a difficult book\" for an unprepared reader, identifying its main themes as those of \"loneliness and failure to communicate\".{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=128}} Ultimately, she thought that repeated re-readings of the novel bring about the realisation that \"it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so-called \"realistic\" juvenile novels.\"{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=131}}\n\n===''The Stone Book'' series and folkloric collections: 1974\u201394===\n\nFrom 1976 to 1978, Garner published a series of four novellas, which have come to be collectively known as ''[[The Stone Book]]'' quartet: ''The Stone Book'', ''Granny Reardun'', ''The Aimer Gate'', and ''Tom Fobble's Day''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}} Each focused on a day in the life of a child in the Garner family, each from a different generation.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}}\nIn a 1989 interview, Garner noted that although writing ''The Stone Book Quartet'' had been \"exhausting\", it had been \"the most rewarding of everything\" he'd done to date.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Philip described the quartet as \"a complete command of the material he had been working and reworking since the start of his career\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\nGarner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading \"[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]\": the footnotes would not have been needed by his father.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 1981, the literary critic Neil Philip published an analysis of Garner's novels as ''A Fine Anger'', which was based on his doctoral thesis, produced for the [[University of London]] in 1980.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=9}} In this study he noted that \"''The Stone Book'' quartet marks a watershed in Garner's writing career, and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far.\"{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}}\n\n===''Strandloper'', ''Thursbitch'' and ''Boneland'': 1995&ndash;present===\n\n[[File:Garner in the field.jpg|thumb|right|Garner at his home in Blackden, 2011]]\n\nIn 1996, Garner's novel ''[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]'' was published. His collection of essays and public talks, ''The Voice That Thunders'', contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with [[bipolar disorder]]), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In ''The Voice That Thunders'' he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought which preceded ''Strandloper'' to 'forsake \"literature\", and become instead a \"popular\" writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'.<ref>Alan Garner, ''The Voice That Thunders'' (London 1997), p. 35.</ref> Garner feared that \"making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death\"<ref>Garner, ''Thunders'', p. 36.</ref> and felt unable to comply.\n\nGarner's novel ''[[Thursbitch]]'' was published in 2003.

Set in Alderley Edge, it revolved around two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to live in the area with their mother's old nurse maid, Bess, and her husband, Gowther Mossock. Setting about to explore the Edge, they discover a race of malevolent creatures, the ''svart alfar'', who dwell in the Edge's abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them, until they are rescued by the wizard Cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are massing at the Edge in search of the eponymous \"weirdstone of Brisingamen\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|pp=12&ndash;13}} Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that \"I couldn't write and teach; the energies were too similar\", and so began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner sent his debut novel to the publishing company [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], where it was picked up by the company's head, Sir William Collins, who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of [[J.

Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954\u201355).{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} Garner, who went on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that \"Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} On its release in 1960, ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' proved to be a critical and commercial success,{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Lake|2y=2010|2pp=316&ndash;317}} later being described as \"a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|pp=316\u2013317}} Garner himself however would later denounce this novel as \"a fairly bad book\" in 1968.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=23}}\n\nWith his first book published, Garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter, living a \"hand to mouth\" lifestyle on a \"shoestring\" budget.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} He also worked on a sequel to ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'', which would be known as ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''. ''The Moon of Gomrath'' also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan, with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the [[Brollachan]] who has recently entered the world. With the help of the wizard Cadellin, the Brollachan is exorcised, but Susan's soul also leaves her body, being sent to another dimension, leading Colin to find a way to bring it back.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} Critic Neil Philip characterised it as \"an artistic advance\" but \"a less satisfying story\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} In a 1989 interview, Garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan, envisioning a trilogy, but that he had intentionally decided not to write it, instead moving on to write something different.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} However ''[[Boneland]]'', the conclusion to the sequence, was belatedly published in August 2012.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/15/alan-garner-weirdstone-brisingamen-trilogy-boneland \"Alan Garner to conclude Weirdstone of Brisingamen trilogy\"].
