He founded the religion of [[Thelema]], identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the [[\u00c6on of Horus]] in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.\n\nBorn to a wealthy family in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], Crowley rejected his parent's [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] [[Plymouth Brethren]] faith to pursue an interest in [[Western esotericism]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a [[British intelligence agency]], further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where he was trained in ceremonial magic by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]]. Moving to [[Boleskine House]] by [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], before studying [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] practices in India. He married [[Rose Edith Kelly]] and in 1904 they honeymooned in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named [[Aiwass]], who provided him with ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus, ''The Book'' declared that its followers should \"Do what thou wilt\" and seek to align themselves with their [[True Will]] through the practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]].\n\nAfter [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga]] and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and [[George Cecil Jones]] co-founded an esoteric order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]], through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the [[First World War]] in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the [[Abbey of Thelema]], a religious commune in [[Cefal\u00f9]], Sicily where he lived with various followers. His [[libertine]] lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.\n\nCrowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a [[recreational drug]] experimenter, [[bisexual]] and an [[individualist]] [[social critic]]. He has been called \"the wickedest man in the world\" and labeled as a [[Satanist]] by the popular press. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the [[counterculture]], and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "pp-protected", "values": [{"name": "reason", "value": "Persistent [[WP:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]"}, {"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "English poet, mountaineer, and occultist"}]}, {"name": "EngvarB", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2017"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2017"}]}, {"name": "Infobox person\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Aleister Crowley"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Aleister Crowley.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "1912 photograph of Aleister Crowley"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Aleister Crowley, c.&nbsp;1912"}, {"name": "birth_name", "value": "Edward Alexander Crowley"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date|df=yes|1875|10|12}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], England"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|df=yes|1947|12|1|1875|10|12}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]], England"}, {"name": "occupation", "value": "Occultist, poet, novelist, mountaineer"}, {"name": "signature", "value": "Signature_of_Aleister_Crowley.svg"}, {"name": "signature_alt", "value": "Aleister Crowley's signature"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "{{marriage|[[Rose Edith Kelly]]|1903|1909|end=div}}<br/> {{marriage|Maria Teresa Sanchez<br>|1929}}"}, {"name": "children", "value": "5"}, {"name": "education", "value": "[[Malvern College]] <br> [[Tonbridge School]] <br> [[Eastbourne College]]"}, {"name": "alma_mater", "value": "[[Trinity College, Cambridge]]"}]}, {"name": "birth date", "values": [{"name": "df", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1875"}, {"name": "2", "value": "10"}, {"name": "3", "value": "12"}]}, {"name": "death date and age", "values": [{"name": "df", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1947"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1875"}, {"name": "5", "value": "10"}, {"name": "6", "value": "12"}]}, {"name": "marriage", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Rose Edith Kelly]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1903"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1909"}, {"name": "end", "value": "div"}]}, {"name": "marriage", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Maria Teresa Sanchez<br>"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1929"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6"}, {"name": "3", "value": "l"}, {"name": "4", "value": "e\u026a"}, {"name": "5", "value": "s"}, {"name": "6", "value": "t"}, {"name": "7", "value": "\u0259r"}, {"name": "8", "value": "_"}, {"name": "9", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "10", "value": "k"}, {"name": "11", "value": "r"}, {"name": "12", "value": "o\u028a"}, {"name": "13", "value": "l"}, {"name": "14", "value": "i"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Early life", "paragraphs": "\n===Youth: 1875\u20131894===\n[[File:Aleister Crowley birthplace.jpg|thumb|alt=2017 photograph of Crowley's birthplace|Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.]]\n\nCrowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=15|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=14}} His father, Edward Crowley (1829\u20131887), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=31\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=4\u20138|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=14\u201315}} His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848\u20131917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as \"the Beast\", a name that he revelled in.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=18\u201321|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=13\u201316|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=17\u201321}} The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=13\u201314|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=17}} and were evangelical Christians.

He developed a love of Scottish culture, describing himself as the \"Laird of Boleskine\", and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits to London.{{sfnm|1a1=Symonds|1y=1997|1p=29|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2pp=107\u201311|3a1=Sutin|3y=2000|3pp=72\u201373|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=68\u201369|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5p=52}} He continued writing poetry, publishing ''Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems'', ''Tales of Archais'', ''Songs of the Spirit'', ''Appeal to the American Republic'', and ''Jephthah'' in 1898\u201399; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics, although ''Jephthah'' was considered a particular critical success.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=114\u201315|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=44\u201345|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=61, 66, 70}}\n\nCrowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn, and was ready to enter the group's inner Second Order.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=115\u201316|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=71\u201372|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=64}} He was unpopular in the group; his bisexuality and [[libertine]] lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation, and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including [[W.

When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space's rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=118\u201323|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=76\u201379|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=75\u201380|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=58\u201360}} Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=27}}\n\n===Mexico, India, Paris, and marriage: 1900\u20131903===\nIn 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States, settling in [[Mexico City]] and starting a relationship with a local woman. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with [[John Dee]]'s [[Enochian]] invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into [[Freemasonry]] while there, and he wrote a play based on [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' as well as a series of poems, published as ''Oracles'' (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including [[Iztaccihuatl]], [[Popocat\u00e9petl|Popocatepetl]], and [[Volc\u00e1n de Colima|Colima]], the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=127\u201337|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=80\u201386|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=83\u201390|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=64\u201370}} Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence.{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=32}} Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the ''Nippon Maru''. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as ''Alice: An Adultery'' (1903).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=137\u201339|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=86\u201390|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=90\u201393|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=71\u201375}}\n\n[[File:Aleister Crowley 1902 K2.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Crowley bathing in a spring during the K2 Expedition|Crowley during the K2 Expedition]]\nBriefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying [[Shaivism]]. The pair spent some time in [[Kandy]] before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the [[Theravada]] tradition, travelling to Burma to do so.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=139\u201344|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=90\u201395|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=93\u201396|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=76\u201378}} Crowley decided to tour India, devoting himself to the Hindu practice of ''[[R\u0101ja yoga]]'', from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]''. He spent much of this time studying at the [[Meenakshi Temple]] in [[Madurai|Madura]]. At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as ''The Sword of Song'' (1904). He contracted [[malaria]], and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=144\u201347|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=94\u201398|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=96\u201398|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=78\u201383}} In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.&nbsp;Wesseley, and [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]]. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted [[K2]], which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with [[influenza]], malaria, and [[snow blindness]], and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} before turning back.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=148\u201356|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=98\u2013104|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=98\u2013108|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=83}}\n\nHaving arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law, the painter [[Gerald Festus Kelly|Gerald Kelly]], and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there, Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. These poems were later published as ''Rodin in Rime'' (1907).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=159\u201363|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=104\u201308|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=109\u201315|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=84\u201386}} One of those frequenting this milieu was [[W. Somerset Maugham]], who after briefly meeting Crowley later used him as a model for the character of [[Oliver Haddo]] in his novel ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'' (1908).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=164\u201367|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=105\u201307|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=112\u201313|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=85}} Returning to Boleskine in April 1903, in August Crowley wed Gerald's sister [[Rose Edith Kelly]] in a \"marriage of convenience\" to prevent her entering an [[arranged marriage]]; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald. Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as ''Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs'' (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire ''Why Jesus Wept'' (1904).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=171\u201377|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=110\u201316|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=119\u201324|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=89\u201390}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfnm",

Crowley's father had been born a [[Quaker]], but had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a faction of a [[Christian fundamentalist]] group known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], with Emily joining him upon marriage.

He contracted [[malaria]], and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=144\u201347|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=94\u201398|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=96\u201398|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=78\u201383}} In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.&nbsp;Wesseley, and [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]]. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted [[K2]], which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with [[influenza]], malaria, and [[snow blindness]], and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} before turning back.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=148\u201356|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=98\u2013104|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=98\u2013108|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=83}}\n\nHaving arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law, the painter [[Gerald Festus Kelly|Gerald Kelly]], and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there, Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. These poems were later published as ''Rodin in Rime'' (1907).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=159\u201363|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=104\u201308|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=109\u201315|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=84\u201386}} One of those frequenting this milieu was [[W.

Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as ''Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs'' (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire ''Why Jesus Wept'' (1904).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=171\u201377|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=110\u201316|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=119\u201324|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=89\u201390}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "127\u201337"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "80\u201386"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "83\u201390"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4pp", "value": "64\u201370"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Spence"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "32"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "137\u201339"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "86\u201390"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "90\u201393"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4pp", "value": "71\u201375"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "139\u201344"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "90\u201395"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "93\u201396"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4pp", "value": "76\u201378"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "144\u201347"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "94\u201398"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "96\u201398"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4pp", "value": "78\u201383"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "20000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "148\u201356"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "98\u2013104"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "98\u2013108"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4p", "value": "83"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "159\u201363"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "104\u201308"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "109\u201315"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4pp", "value": "84\u201386"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "164\u201367"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "105\u201307"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "112\u201313"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4p", "value": "85"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "171\u201377"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "110\u201316"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "119\u201324"}, {"name": "4a1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "4y", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "4pp", "value": "89\u201390"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Developing Thelema", "paragraphs": "\n===Egypt and ''The Book of the Law'': 1904===\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Had!

She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]]; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, the [[Number of the Beast]] in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the \"Stele of Revealing.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=182\u201383|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=120\u201322|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=124\u201326|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=96\u201398}}\n\nAccording to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of [[Aiwass]], the messenger of Horus, or [[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-Paar-Kraat]]. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it ''Liber AL vel Legis'' or ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=122\u201325|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=127\u201329}} The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]], and that Crowley would serve as its [[prophet]]. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, [[Thelema]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=125\u201333}} Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with ''The Book of the Law''. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}}\n\n===Kanchenjunga and China: 1905\u201306===\nReturning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=189, 194\u201395|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=140\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=130|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic ''Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden'' to entertain his recuperating wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=195\u201396|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=132|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]. Among its first publications were Crowley's ''Collected Works'', edited by Ivor Back.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=190|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=131\u201333}} His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C. Fuller]], a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, ''The Star in the West'' (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=241\u201342|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=177\u201379|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=136\u201337, 139, 168\u201369}}\n\n[[File:Kanchenjunga India.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A photograph of Kangchenjunga|[[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]], as seen from [[Darjeeling]]]]\n\nCrowley decided to climb [[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]] in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world's most treacherous mountain.

Many of his articles in ''The Fatherland'' were hyperbolic, for instance comparing [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt\u2014reported on by ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the [[Statue of Liberty]]; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1pp=247\u201348|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201376|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=284\u201387, 292\u201392|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5pp=190\u201393}} It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the ''Lusitania'', informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=82\u201389|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2pp=195\u201397}}\n\nCrowley entered into a relationship with [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], with whom he toured the West Coast. In [[Vancouver]], headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent. In Detroit he experimented with [[Peyote]] at [[Parke-Davis]], then visited Seattle, San Francisco, [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], Los Angeles, San Diego, [[Tijuana]], and the [[Grand Canyon]], before returning to New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=330\u201333|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=251\u201355|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=288\u201391, 295\u201397|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=198\u2013203}} There he befriended [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and his wife Alice Richardson; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916, following which she became pregnant and then miscarried.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=333|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=255\u201357|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=298\u2013301}} Later that year he took a \"magical retirement\" to a cabin by [[Newfound Lake|Lake Pasquaney]] owned by Evangeline Adams. There, he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself \"Master Therion\". He also wrote several short stories based on [[James George Frazer|J.G.

She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]]; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, the [[Number of the Beast]] in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the \"Stele of Revealing.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=182\u201383|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=120\u201322|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=124\u201326|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=96\u201398}}\n\nAccording to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of [[Aiwass]], the messenger of Horus, or [[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-Paar-Kraat]].

It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will.

Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Quote box", "values": [{"name": "width", "value": "25em"}, {"name": "align", "value": "right"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "Had!

In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C.

Assembling a team consisting of [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod|Jacot-Guillarmod]], Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|the expedition]] was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=201\u201315|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=149\u201358|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=138\u201349|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=111\u201312}}\n\nSpending time in [[Hariharpur, India|Moharbhanj]], where he took part in [[big-game hunting]] and wrote the homoerotic work ''The Scented Garden'', Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] before being forced to leave India after non-lethally shooting two men who tried to mug him.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=217\u201319|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=158\u201362|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=151\u201352}} Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma, Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China, hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=221|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=162\u201363|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=114}} Spence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region's opium trade.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=33\u201335|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=115}} Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey, which took the family from [[Tengchong|Tengyueh]] through to Yungchang, [[Dali, Yunnan|Tali]], [[Kunming|Yunnanfu]], and then [[Hanoi]].

illusionists.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=301|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=222\u201324|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=247\u201350|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=166}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfnm", "values":

magus\".{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=302|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=224\u201325|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=251}} The German occultist [[Theodor Reuss]] later accused him of publishing some of the secrets of his own occult order, the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), within ''The Book''. Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley as head of the O.T.O's British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), and at a ceremony in [[Berlin]] Crowley adopted the magical name of [[Baphomet]] and was proclaimed \"X\u00b0 Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons\".{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=302\u201305|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=225\u201326|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=251\u201325}} With Reuss' permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on [[Freemasonry]]; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by the O.T.O's emphasis on [[sex magic]], Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|eleventh degree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=306|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=228|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=256}}\n\nIn March 1913 Crowley acted as producer for ''The Ragged Ragtime Girls'', a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at London's [[Old Tivoli]] theatre. They subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks, where Crowley had a sadomasochistic relationship with the Hungarian Anny Ringler.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=308\u201309|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=232\u201334|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=261\u201365}} In Moscow, Crowley continued to write plays and poetry, including \"Hymn to [[Pan (god)|Pan]]\", and the [[Gnostic Mass]], a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=309\u201310|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=234\u201335|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=264}} Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city.{{sfn|Churton|2011|pp=178\u201382}} In January 1914 Crowley and Neuburg settled into an apartment in Paris, where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding [[Jacob Epstein]]'s new monument to [[Oscar Wilde]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=307|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=218|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=266\u201367}} Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six-week \"Paris Working\", a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist [[Walter Duranty]]. Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote ''Liber Agap\u00e9'', a treatise on sex magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=313\u201316|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=235\u201340|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=269\u201374}} Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley [[curse]]d him.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=317\u201319|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=240\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=275\u201376}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1p", "value": "302"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "224\u201325"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3p", "value": "251"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "302\u201305"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "225\u201326"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "251\u201325"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1p", "value": "306"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2p", "value": "228"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3p", "value": "256"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "308\u201309"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "232\u201334"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "261\u201365"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "309\u201310"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "234\u201335"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3p", "value": "264"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Churton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "178\u201382"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1p", "value": "307"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2p", "value": "218"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "266\u201367"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "313\u201316"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "235\u201340"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "269\u201374"}]}, {"name": "sfnm", "values": [{"name": "1a1", "value": "Booth"}, {"name": "1y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "1pp", "value": "317\u201319"}, {"name": "2a1", "value": "Sutin"}, {"name": "2y", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2pp", "value": "240\u201341"}, {"name": "3a1", "value": "Kaczynski"}, {"name": "3y", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "3pp", "value": "275\u201376"}]}], "id": 11}, {"title": "United States: 1914\u20131919", "paragraphs": "By 1914 Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from A\u2234A\u2234 members and dues payments made to O.T.O.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=321}} In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=321\u201322|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=240|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=277|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=186}} and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps.

He became involved in New York's pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy [[George Sylvester Viereck]] employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, ''[[The Fatherland]]'', which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=326\u201330|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=245\u201347|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=283\u201384}} In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=247|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=186}} In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany's operation in New York. Many of his articles in ''The Fatherland'' were hyperbolic, for instance comparing [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt\u2014reported on by ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the [[Statue of Liberty]]; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1pp=247\u201348|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201376|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=284\u201387, 292\u201392|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5pp=190\u201393}} It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the ''Lusitania'', informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=82\u201389|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2pp=195\u201397}}\n\nCrowley entered into a relationship with [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], with whom he toured the West Coast. In [[Vancouver]], headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent.

There, prominent members like [[Karl Germer]] and Martha K\u00fcntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like [[Albin Grau]], Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tr\u00e4nker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=423\u201344|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=324\u201328|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=418\u201319|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=291\u201392, 332}} Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=425\u201326|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=332\u201334|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=426\u201327, 430\u201333}} Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=429\u201330}} In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman [[Israel Regardie]], who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=426|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=336\u201337|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=432\u201333|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=309}} That year, Crowley also met [[Gerald Yorke]], who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=427\u201328|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=335|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=427\u201329|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=299}} He also befriended the homosexual journalist [[Tom Driberg]]; Driberg did not accept Thelema either.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=428\u201329|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=331\u201332|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=423|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=296\u201398|5a1=Pasi|5y=2014|5pp=72\u201376}} It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, ''[[Magick (Book 4)|Magick in Theory and Practice]]'', which received little attention at the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=431|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=339|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=426, 428\u201329|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=308\u201309}}\n\nIn December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=430\u201331|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=340\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=433\u201334|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=310}} Crowley was deported from France by the authorities, who disliked his reputation and feared that he was a German agent.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=432\u201333|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=438|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=306, 312\u201314}} So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=434\u201335|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=342, 345|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=440|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=318}} Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel [[Moonchild (novel)|''Moonchild'']] and book of short stories [[The Stratagem and other Stories|''The Stratagem'']].

and [[modern Paganism]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=1}} Although holding ''The Book of the Law''\u2014which was composed in 1904\u2014as its central text, Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=88}}\n\nIn his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to \"bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form\", although what he meant by \"[[paganism]]\" was unclear.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}}\nCrowley's thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, [[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific naturalism]], and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, [[Rosicrucianism]], Kabbalah, and the Tarot.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=23}} He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=86}} Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and [[Tantra]] into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=36}}\nThe historian Alex Owen noted that Crowley adhered to the \"modus operandi\" of the [[Decadent movement]] throughout his life.{{sfn|Owen|2012|p=37}}\n\nCrowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity's entry to the Aeon of Horus, a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny. He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2012|1p=210|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=3}} He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus,{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=88}} and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=51}} Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Drury|2y=2012|2p=209}} Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one's True Will to be \"the Great Work\" or the attaining of the \"knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\".{{sfn|Asprem|2013|pp=88\u201389}} His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=89}} The moral code of \"Do What Thou Wilt\" is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not [[anarchism|anarchistic]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}}\n\n===Magick and theology===\nCrowley believed in the objective existence of [[magic (supernatural)|magic]], which he chose to spell \"Magick\", an older archaic spelling of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Asprem|2y=2013|2p=89|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He provided various different definitions of this term over his career.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In his book ''Magick in Theory and Practice'', Crowley defined Magick as \"the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=DuQuette|2y=2003|2p=11|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He also told his disciple Karl Germer that \"Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.\"{{sfn|Churton|2011|p=417}} Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving ''The Equinox'' the subtitle of ''The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion''.{{sfnm|1a1=Asprem|1y=2008|1p=140|2a1=Bogdan|2a2=Starr|2y=2012|2p=4}} Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the [[scientific method]],{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, \"The more scientific the record is, the better.\"{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=151\u201352}} His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=145, 149}} Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} In Crowley's alternative schema, old systems of ''magic'' had to decline (per Frazer's framework) so that science and magic could synthesize into ''magick'', which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an [[experiment|experimental method]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=170}} Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, adopting an [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of magic, science, and technology.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=172\u201373}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"To [Crowley] the greatest aim of the magician was to merge with a higher power connected to the wellsprings of the universe, but he did not trouble himself too much to define that power consistently; sometimes it was God, sometimes the One, sometimes a goddess, and sometimes one's own Holy Guardian Angel or higher self. In the last analysis he was content for the nature of divinity to remain a mystery.

wealth.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Hutton also described Crowley as having both an \"unappeasable desire\" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and \"a tendency to quarrel savagely\"

cruelty\".{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=10}} Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a
