In June 1729, the Abdali forces under Zulfiqar had surrendered to Nader Shah Afshar, the rising new ruler of Persia. However, they soon began a rebellion and took over Herat as well as Mashad. In July 1730, he defeated Ibrahim Khan, a military commander and brother of [[Nader Shah]]. This prompted Nader Shah to retake Mashad and also intervene in the power struggle of Harat. By July 1731, Zulfiqar returned to his capital [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]] where he had been serving as the [[List of governors of Farah|governor]] since 1726. A year later Nadir's brother Ibrahim Khan took control of Farah. During this time Zulfiqar and the young Durrani fled to Kandahar where they took refuge with the Ghiljis. They were later made political prisoners by [[Hussain Hotak]], the Ghilji ruler of the Kandahar region.<ref>Sarkar, p. 124</ref>\n\nNader Shah had been enlisting the Abdalis in his army since around 1729. After [[Siege of Kandahar|conquering Kandahar]] in 1738, Durrani and his brother Zulfiqar were freed and provided with leading careers in Nader Shah's administration. Zulfiqar was made Governor of [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]] while Durrani remained working as Nader Shah's personal attendant. The Ghiljis, who are originally from the territories east of the Kandahar region, were expelled from Kandahar in order to resettle the Abdalis along with some [[Qizilbash]] and other Persians.<ref name=EofI>C.

The city fell to the Afghans in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; the Afghan forces then pushed on into present-day Iran, capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751.

The area was subjected to [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang|Turkification and Islamification at the hands of invading Turkic Muslims]]. Both the Buddhist Turkic [[Uyghurs]] and Muslim Turkic [[Karluks]] participated in the Turkification and conquest of the native Buddhist Indo-European inhabitants of the Tarim Basin. The Turkic Muslims then proceeded to conquer the Turkic Buddhists in Islamic holy wars and converted them to Islam. The mixture between the invading Mongoloid Turkic peoples and the native Caucasian Indo-European inhabitants resulted in the modern day Turkic speaking hybrid Europoid-East Asian inhabitants of Xinjiang. The Turkification was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic Kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. Halfway in the 10th century the Saka Iranic Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader [[Yusuf Qadir Khan]] conquered Khotan around 1006.<ref name=\"Millward2007\">{{cite book|author=James A.

The [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the Afaqi Khoja inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan Buddhists]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Zunghar Khanate to act on this invitation.

They included water conservancy tax, draught animal tax, fruit tax, poll tax, land tax, tress and grass tax, gold and silver tax, and trade tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted a tax of 67,000 tangas of silver from the Kashgar people in [[Galdan Tseren]]'s reign, a five percent tax was imposed on foreign traders and a ten percent tax imposed on Muslim merchants, people had to pay a fruit tax if they owned orchards and merchants had to pay a copper and silver tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted 100,000 silver tangas in tax from [[Yarkent Khanate|Yarkand]] and slapped livestock, stain, commerce, and a gold tax on them.

The Dzungars also extorted extra taxes on cotton, silver, gold, and traded goods from the Muslims besides making them pay the official tax. \"Wine, meat, and women\" and \"a parting gift\" were forcibly extracted from the Uighurs daily by the Dzungars who went to physically gather the taxes from the Uighur Muslims, and if they dissatisfied with what they received, they would rape women, and loot and steal property and livestock.

The early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of [[Sadashivrao Bhau]]. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a battle for control of northern India.

The mixture between the invading Mongoloid Turkic peoples and the native Caucasian Indo-European inhabitants resulted in the modern day Turkic speaking hybrid Europoid-East Asian inhabitants of Xinjiang.

The [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the Afaqi Khoja inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan Buddhists]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Zunghar Khanate to act on this invitation.

They included water conservancy tax, draught animal tax, fruit tax, poll tax, land tax, tress and grass tax, gold and silver tax, and trade tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted a tax of 67,000 tangas of silver from the Kashgar people in [[Galdan Tseren]]'s reign, a five percent tax was imposed on foreign traders and a ten percent tax imposed on Muslim merchants, people had to pay a fruit tax if they owned orchards and merchants had to pay a copper and silver tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted 100,000 silver tangas in tax from [[Yarkent Khanate|Yarkand]] and slapped livestock, stain, commerce, and a gold tax on them. The Dzungars extracted 700 [[tael]]s of gold, and also extracted cotton, copper, and cloth, from the six regions of [[Keriya Town|Keriya]], [[Kashgar]], [[Khotan]], [[Kucha]], Yarkand, and [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]] as stated by Russian topographer [[Yakoff Filisoff]].

The Dzungars also extorted extra taxes on cotton, silver, gold, and traded goods from the Muslims besides making them pay the official tax. \"Wine, meat, and women\" and \"a parting gift\" were forcibly extracted from the Uighurs daily by the Dzungars who went to physically gather the taxes from the Uighur Muslims, and if they dissatisfied with what they received, they would rape women, and loot and steal property and livestock.

His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after they took complete control of the former Mughal province of [[Bengal]] in 1793. However, fear of another Afghan invasion was to haunt British policy for almost half a century after the [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|battle of Panipat]]. The acknowledgment of Abdali's military accomplishments is reflected in a British intelligence report on the Battle of Panipat, which referred to Ahmad Shah as the 'King of Kings'.<ref name=\"British library\">[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpregion/asia/afghanistan/afghanistancollection/afghansources/sources1747to1809.html \"Afghanistan 1747\u20131809: Sources in the India Office Records\"]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> This fear led in 1798 to a British envoy being sent to the Persian court in part to instigate the Persians in their claims on Herat to forestall an Afghan invasion of India that might have halted British East India company's expansion.<ref name=\"British library\"/> [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] wrote of Ahmad Shah:\n{{quote|His military courage and activity are spoken of with admiration, both by his own subjects and the nations with whom he was engaged, either in wars or alliances.

Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others by the end of the 19th century. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some [[Pashtun tribes]] and those of other Durrani lineages. Until [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units. This policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like [[Babur]] or [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and make India the base for his empire.\n\nIn Pakistan, a [[short-range ballistic missile]] [[Abdali-I]], is named in the honour of Ahmed Shah Abdali.<ref>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GI03Df02.html Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Panipat (film)|Panipat]]'', has Ahmad Shah Durrani being played by Bollywood actor; [[Sanjay Dutt]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Under the shimmering turquoise dome that dominates the sand-blown city of Kandahar lies the body of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the young Kandahari warrior who in 1747 became the region's first Durrani king.
