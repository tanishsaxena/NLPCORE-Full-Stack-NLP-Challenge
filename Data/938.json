Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up \"A\" Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of \"good will between the classes\" and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to \"A\" Mountain to \"light up\" Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before [[Homecoming]], a tradition that dates to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecoming.asu.edu/ |title=ASU homecoming &#124; ASU Homecoming |publisher=Homecoming.asu.edu |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Victory Bell===\nIn 2012, Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121119_victorybell |title=Sun Devil Athletics brings back Victory Bell in return to tradition &#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=November 19, 2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref> The ROTC cadets associated with the university transport the bell to various events and ring it after Sun Devil victories.

The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the [[Super Bowl XLII]], in addition to many others.<ref name=\"history\" /> Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of [[head coach]] Todd Graham.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thesundevils.com/news/2013/4/17/208257004.aspx|title=Arizona State University Official Athletic Site - Gameday |publisher=Arizona State University|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The most recognizable songs played by the band are \"Alma Mater\" and ASU's [[fight songs]] titled \"[[Maroon and gold|Maroon and Gold]]\" and the \"Al Davis Fight Song\". \"Alma Mater\" was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A.

The \"Al Davis Fight Song\" (also known as \"Go, Go Sun Devils\" and \"Arizona State University Fight Song\") was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics.

They are more than just similar in tone. Whitaker has also been accused of appropriating training materials produced by the Chicago Police Department which he used as the basis for a lucrative contract with the Phoenix Police Department. Whitaker was to receive $268,800 to provide \"cultural-consciousness training\" to Phoenix police. The Phoenix Police Department wants back the $21,900 it has paid thus far.

To the intense consternation of ASU faculty members (the chairman of the tenure committee resigned in protest) an investigating committee concluded there was no pattern of deceit and the copying had been inadvertent. It all popped up again in 2014 with another Whitaker book, \"Peace Be Still: Modern Black America From World War II to Barack Obama.\" A blogger writing under an apparent pseudonym set out side-by-side excerpts from Whitaker's book and material available on the Web at sites like infoplease.com and the Archive of American Television. They are more than just similar in tone. Whitaker has also been accused of appropriating training materials produced by the Chicago Police Department which he used as the basis for a lucrative contract with the Phoenix Police Department. Whitaker was to receive $268,800 to provide \"cultural-consciousness training\" to Phoenix police. The Phoenix Police Department wants back the $21,900 it has paid thus far.
