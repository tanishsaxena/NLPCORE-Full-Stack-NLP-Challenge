'''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|Rep\u00fablica de Angola}}; [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]] and {{lang-umb|Repubilika ya Ngola}}), is a west-coast country of [[Southern Africa|south]]-[[central Africa]]. It is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]], bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is [[Luanda]].\n\nThe territory of Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Era]], hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups, tribes and kingdoms. The nation state of Angola originated from [[Portuguese colonization of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].\n\nAfter a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], independence was achieved in 1975 as the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola]], a [[one-party state]] supported by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. The [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between the ruling [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) and the insurgent anti-communist [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), supported by the United States and [[apartheid South Africa]], lasted until 2002. The [[sovereign state]] has since become a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic|constitutional republic]].\n\nAngola has vast [[Mineral reserve|mineral]] and [[petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, the [[standard of living]] remains low for most of the population, and [[life expectancy]] in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while [[infant mortality]] is among the highest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006051053/http://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|archive-date=6 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAngola is a member state of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]].
