This corresponds to about 7.5 \u03bcmol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia \"leaves\" lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.<ref name=\"chemotaxonomie\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpnboQBbw7EC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=acacia+tryptamine |title=Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer |date= 1996-01-01|accessdate=2013-03-06|isbn=9783764351656|last1=Hegnauer |first1=R. }}</ref>\n\nSome ''Acacia'' species containing cyanogens include ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'', ''A. cunninghamii'', ''A. obtusifolia'', ''A. sieberiana'', and ''A. sieberiana'' var.
