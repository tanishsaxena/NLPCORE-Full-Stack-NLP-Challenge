The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 [[Carl Linnaeus]] created the name ''Amaryllis belladonna'', the [[type species]] of the genus ''Amaryllis''. At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus's type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, ''Amaryllis'' would be the correct name for the genus ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. [[Alan W. Meerow]] et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that ''Amaryllis'' <small>L.</small> should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African ''[[Amaryllis belladonna]]'' from the [[George Clifford III|Clifford Herbarium]] at the [[Natural History Museum]] in London.<ref>{{Citation |last=Meerow |first=Alan W. |last2=Van Scheepen |first2=Johan |last3=Dutilh |first3=Julie H.A. |year=1997 |title=Transfers from ''Amaryllis'' to ''Hippeastrum (Amaryllidaceae)'' |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201319 |jstor=1224287 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\nAmaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow:\n\nThese are phylogenetically related as follows:\n\n{{clade\n| label1= Tribe '''Amaryllideae'''\n\n| 1= {{clade\n| 1= Subtribe '''Amaryllidinae'''\n| 2= {{clade\n| 1= Subtribe [[Boophoninae]]\n| 2= {{clade\n|       1= Subtribe [[Strumariinae]]\n|       2= Subtribe [[Crininae]]\n    }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n\n===Etymology ===\nThe name ''Amaryllis'' is taken from a shepherdess in [[Virgil]]'s pastoral ''[[Eclogues]]'', (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[:wikt:\u1f00\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9|\u1f00\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9]]}} (''{{lang|el|amarysso}}''), meaning \"to sparkle\")  and also from \"Amarella\" for the bitterness of the bulb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=amaryllis|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Amaryllis|author=Mike Campbell|work=Behind the Name}}</ref><ref>Linn\u00e9, Carl von. 1737.

The hybrids were crossed back onto the original ''Amaryllis belladonna'' and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the \"side-facing\" habit of the \"old-fashioned\" pink.
