However, \"asphalt\" is also commonly used as a shortened form of \"[[asphalt concrete]]\" (therefore equivalent to the British \"asphalt\" or \"tarmac\").\n\nIn [[Canadian English]], the word \"bitumen\" is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy [[crude oil]],<ref name=\"oilsands\">{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/793.asp|title=What is Oil Sands|year=2007|publisher=Alberta Energy|accessdate=10 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205055523/http://www.qrpoil.com/site/?bitumen|archivedate=5 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> while \"asphalt\" is used for the oil refinery product.

The [[oil sands]] of [[Alberta, Canada]] are a similar material.\n\nNeither of the terms \"asphalt\" or \"bitumen\" should be confused with [[tar]] or [[coal tars]]. Tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and [[pyrolysis]] of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses, whether fossilized as with coal, or freshly harvested. The majority of bitumen, on the other hand, was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] point, where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined together in long chains in the absence of oxygen. Bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid. It may even be mixed in with coal deposits. Bitumen, and coal using the [[Bergius process]], can be refined into petrols such as gasoline, and bitumen may be distilled into tar, not the other way around.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=PzwX-xbaUGIC&pg=PA980&dq=Bitumen+mixed+with+clay+was+usually+called+%22asphaltum#v=onepage&q=Bitumen%20mixed%20with%20clay%20was%20usually%20called%20%22asphaltum&f=false"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Mines and quarries 1902"}, {"name": "last", "value": "census, 1900"}, {"name": "first", "value": "United States Census Office 12th"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Steuart"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "William Mott"}, {"name": "last3", "value": "Census"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "United States Bureau of the"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1905"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Govt.

[[St. Charles Avenue]] in [[New Orleans]] was paved its whole length with asphalt by 1889.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catharinecole.startlogic.com/catharinecole/page3.html |title=title |publisher=Catharinecole.startlogic.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref> \n\nIn 1900 Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses, pulling streetcars, wagons, and carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.  Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets. They looked to wood or granite blocks by the 1850s.<ref>David O. Whitten, \"A Century of Parquet Pavements: Wood as a Paving Material In The United States And Abroad, 1840\u20131940.\" ''Essays in Economic and Business History'' 15 (1997): 209-26.</ref> In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud.  Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was asphalt paving, which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers. With London and Paris serving as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882; it became the model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, well ahead of brick.<ref>Arthur Maier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878\u20131898'' (1933), pp. 88\u201393.</ref>  The streets became faster and more dangerous so electric traffic lights were installed.  Electric trolleys (at 12 miles per hour) became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on asphalt highways.<ref>John D.

In 1719, a [[Cree]] named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample for trade to [[Henry Kelsey]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] saw the Athabasca oil sands and said, \"At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance.\"<ref name=oilsandfacts/>\n\nThe value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]], was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl A. Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/robert-fitzsimmons.html | title = Robert C.

Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives.<ref name = oilsandfacts/> Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.history.alberta.ca/energyheritage/bitumount/default.aspx | title = Bitumount | year = 2016 | publisher = Government of Alberta | access-date = 2016-01-20}}</ref>\n\n===Photography and art===\nBitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist [[Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.<ref>[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Ni\u00e9pce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 27 October 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803222723/http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html |date=3 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227215421/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ |date=27 December 2009 }} Retrieved 27 October 2012.</ref>\n\nBitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818\u20131819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.<ref name=\"WSJ 2009-08-21\">{{cite news |last=Spiegelman |first=Willard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204119704574236393080650258 |title=Revolutionary Romanticism: 'The Raft of the Medusa' brought energy to French art |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cn", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Pringle, Heather Anne"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Barnes & Noble Books"}, {"name": "location", "value": "New York, NY"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "196\u2013197"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-7607-7151-8"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "De Materia Medica"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/BIUSante_dioscsprengelx01"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Pedanius Dioscorides"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Connan"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Jacques"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Nissenbaum"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Arie"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The organic geochemistry of the Hasbeya asphalt (Lebanon): comparison with asphalts from the Dead Sea area and Iraq"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Organic Geochemistry"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "35"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "6"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "775\u2013789"}, {"name": "issn", "value": "0146-6380"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.orggeochem.2004.01.015"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.academia.edu/16512751"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://payperview.datapages.com/data/open/offer.do?target=%2Fbulletns%2F1977-79%2Fdata%2Fpg%2F0062%2F0005%2F0800%2F0837.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Dead Sea Asphalts\u2014Historical Aspects [free abstract]"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Arie Nissenbaum"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "AAPG Bulletin"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "62"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "5"}, {"name": "date", "value": "May 1978"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "837\u2013844"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1306/c1ea4e5f-16c9-11d7-8645000102c1865d"}]}, {"name": "cn", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502"}, {"name": "title", "value": "C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Morro Creek'', ed. by A.

Especially where mud or trenching often made streets difficult to pass. pavements were sometimes made of diverse materials including wooden planks, cobble stones or other stone blocks, or bricks. Unpaved roads produced uneven wear and hazards for pedestrians.   In the late 19th century with the rise of the popular [[bicycle]], bicycle clubs were important in pushing for more general pavement of streets.  <ref>{{cite web|last=Pintak |first=Lawrence |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/3/19/8253035/roads-cyclists-cars-history |title=\"Roads were not built for cars\": how cyclists, not drivers, first fought to pave US roads |publisher=Vox |date=2015-03-19 |accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref> Advocacy for pavement increased in the early 20th century with the rise of the [[automobile]].

In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in [[Edmonton]], Alberta.

Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]].

According to the requirements of the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the [[Binder (material)|binder]] in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] such as [[sand]], [[gravel]] and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., [[Natural rubber|rubber]] [[tire|tyres]]), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.\n\nA further 10% of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications, where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable.\nThe remaining 5% of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials, such as pipe coatings, carpet tile backing and paint. Asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures, systems, and components, such as the following:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Highways\n* Airport runways\n* Footways and pedestrian ways\n* Car parks\n* Racetracks\n* Tennis courts\n* Roofing\n* Damp proofing\n* Dams\n* Reservoir and pool linings\n* Soundproofing\n* Pipe coatings\n* Cable coatings\n* Paints\n* Building water proofing\n* Tile underlying waterproofing\n* Newspaper ink production\n* and many other applications\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Rolled asphalt concrete===\n{{Main|Asphalt concrete}}The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States.

Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility.

Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for [[runway]]s.\n\n===Mastic asphalt===\n{{Further|Fibre mastic asphalt}}\n[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher asphalt ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7\u201310% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% asphalt. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{convert|210|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick.\n\n===Asphalt emulsion===\nA number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form \"cutbacks\" with reduced melting point or mixing with water to turn the asphalt into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.\n\n===Synthetic crude oil===\n{{Main|Synthetic crude oil}}\n{{See also|Petroleum production in Canada}}\nSynthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) [[power shovel]]s and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) [[dump trucks]] for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl Clark]] of the [[University of Alberta]] during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a [[Upgrader|bitumen upgrader]] which converts it into a [[light crude oil]] equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional [[oil pipeline]]s and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over {{convert|1|Moilbbl}} per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.<ref name=NEBstats>{{cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/index-eng.html | title = Crude Oil and Petroleum Products | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] of Canada | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The [[Suncor Energy]] upgrader near [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the [[Syncrude Canada]], [[Canadian Natural Resources]], and [[Nexen]] upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell [[Scotford Upgrader]] near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery.<ref name=CAPP2015>{{cite web|url=http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |title=2015 CAPP Crude Oil Forecast, Markets & Transportation |publisher=[[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120081514/http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |archivedate=20 January 2016 }}</ref> A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near [[Redwater, Alberta]], will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nwrpartnership.com/ | title = The Project | publisher = North West Redwater Partnership | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Non-upgraded crude bitumen===\n{{See also|Western Canadian Select}}\nCanadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through [[oil pipeline]]s to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US [[Gulf coast]], where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US [[Midwest]] where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline.<ref name=CAPP2015/> By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl}} per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.<ref name=NEBstats/>\n\nBecause of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with [[natural-gas condensate]] in a form called [[dilbit]] or with synthetic crude oil, called [[synbit]]. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as [[Western Canadian Select]]. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|Mexican Mayan]] or Arabian [[Dubai Crude]].<ref name=CAPP2015/>\n\n===Radioactive waste encapsulation matrix===\n\nAsphalt was used starting in the 1960s as a [[hydrophobic]] matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble [[sodium nitrate]] and [[sodium sulfate]]) produced by the reprocessing of [[spent nuclear fuel]]s or radioactive [[sludge]]s from sedimentation ponds.<ref>Rodier, J., Scheidhauer, J., & Malabre, M.

One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of [[hydrogen]] gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma [[radiolysis]].<ref>Johnson, D.I., Hitchon, J.W., & Phillips, D.C.

Journal of nuclear materials, 125(2), 202\u2013218.</ref> A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated [[hygroscopic]] salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for [[osmosis|osmotic]] effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a [[Semipermeable membrane|semi-permeable membrane]]. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high [[ionic strength]] of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the [[redox]] conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides.

The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high [[ionic strength]] of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks.

This step makes the product harder and more viscous.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nAsphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around {{convert|150|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called \"bitumen feedstock\", or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns.\n\n===Oil sands===\n{{Main|Oil sands}}\nNaturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from \"[[oil sands]]\", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres<ref name=oilsands/> (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] are the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[world oil market chronology from 2003|oil price increases after 2003]], producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about {{convert|2.3|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020.<ref name=\"CAPP\"/> The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}},<ref name=ST98/> which at a rate of {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} would last about 200 years.\n\n===Alternatives and bioasphalt===\n{{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}\nAlthough uncompetitive economically, asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es. Asphalt can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used [[motor oil]], which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10298436.2010.488729| issn = 1029-8436| volume = 11| issue = 6| pages = 541\u2013553| last = Hesp| first = Simon A.M.|author2=Herbert F.

The bitumen is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120&nbsp;\u00b0C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.\n\nAlbanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman [[Henri Coquand|Coquand]] published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giavarini|first1=Carlo|title=Six Thousand Years of Asphalt|date=March 2013|publisher=SITEB|isbn=978-88-908408-3-8|pages=71\u201378}}</ref>\n\nToday the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable.
