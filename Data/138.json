Commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and lunar module pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] formed the American crew that landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ''Eagle'' on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and they collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to [[Earth]]. Command module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] flew the [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']] alone in [[lunar orbit]] while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named [[Tranquility Base]] before lifting off to rejoin ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.\n\nApollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module (CM)]] with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [[Apollo service module|service module (SM)]], which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module (LM)]] that had two stages\u2014a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\n\nAfter being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into ''Eagle'' and landed in the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on July 20. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that propelled ''Columbia'' out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} They returned to Earth and [[Splashdown|splashed down]] in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\n\nArmstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"{{efn|Eric Jones of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal explains that the \"a\" article was intended, whether or not it was said; the intention was to contrast ''a man'' (an individual's action) and ''mankind'' (as a species).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1092413|title=One Small Step|last1=Jones|first=Eric|website=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal|access-date=September 6, 2019|date=April 8, 2018}}</ref>|name=transcript}}<ref name=\"ALSJ 4\" /> Apollo 11 effectively ended the [[Space Race]] and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and Apollo{{nbsp}}9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo{{nbsp}}8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThere would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], the CMP on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288\u2013289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, [[Fred Haise]] filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}} Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} the first being Apollo 10.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=72}} The next was [[STS-26]] in 1988.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}}\n\n[[Deke Slayton]] gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin, but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually [[Apollo 13]]).{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nThe Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of [[Apollo 12]]. Instead they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=434\u2013435}} Aldrin and Collins described the crew as \"amiable strangers\".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}} Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said \"...&nbsp;all the crews I was on worked very well together.\"{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}}\n\n=== Backup crew ===\n\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology  = Astronaut\n|position1    = Commander\n|crew1_up     = [[Jim Lovell|James A.

Haise Jr.]]\n}}\n\nThe backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, [[William Anders]] as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo{{nbsp}}8.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} In early 1969, he accepted a job with the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics and Space Council]] effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly were later assigned as the prime crew of [[Apollo 13]].{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}}\n\n=== Support crew ===\n\nDuring Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=261}} For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and [[William R. Pogue|Bill Pogue]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=375}}\n\n=== Capsule communicators ===\n\n[[File:Duke, Lovell and Haise at the Apollo 11 Capcom, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas - 19690720.jpg|thumb|CAPCOM [[Charles Duke]] (left), with backup crewmen [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Fred Haise]] listening in during Apollo 11's descent]]\n\nThe [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the [[Christopher C.

Scientific value was not a consideration.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=19}}\n\nAreas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=98\u201399}} Five sites were considered: Sites{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were in the Sea of Tranquility (''[[Mare Tranquilitatis]]''); Site{{nbsp}}3 was in the Central Bay (''[[Sinus Medii]]''); and Sites{{nbsp}}4 and{{nbsp}}5 were in the Ocean of Storms (''[[Oceanus Procellarum]]'').<ref name=\"Site Selection\" />\nThe final site selection was based on seven criteria:\n* The site needed to be smooth, with relatively few craters;\n* with approach paths free of large hills, tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings;\n* reachable with a minimum amount of propellant;\n* allowing for delays in the launch countdown;\n* providing the Apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory, one that would allow it to coast around the Moon and safely return to Earth without requiring any engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the Moon;\n* with good visibility during the landing approach, meaning the Sun would be between 7{{nbsp}}and 20 degrees behind the LM; and\n* a general slope of less than two degrees in the landing area.<ref name=\"Site Selection\" />\n\nThe requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month.<ref name=\"Site Selection\" /> A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience.{{sfn|Collins|1994|p=7}} The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site{{nbsp}}2, with Sites 3{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed.

Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=363\u2013365}}\n\nFor decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=149}} Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, \"Yes, that's the way to do it.\"{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=150}}\n\nThe media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=281}} [[Chris Kraft]] revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon.

Although it has been said \"not since [[Adam]] has any human known such solitude\",{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}} Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: \"this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two\".{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}} In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while ''Columbia'' passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather \"awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation\".{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}}\n\nOne of Collins' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the [[fuel cell]]s and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=401\u2013407}}\n\nJust before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of ''Columbia'' might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When ''Columbia'' came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as \"relaxing\". After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for ''Eagle'' to meet up with ''Columbia'', Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly ''Columbia'' down to meet ''Eagle''.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=406\u2013408, 410}}\n\n=== Return ===\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|right|''Eagle''{{'s}} ascent stage approaching ''Columbia'']]\n\n''Eagle'' rendezvoused with ''Columbia'' at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35.

Full shutdown of the first-stage engines occurred about 2{{nbsp}}minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed by separation of the S-IC and ignition of the S-II engines.

About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver was performed. This involved separating ''Columbia'' from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with ''Eagle'' still attached to the stage.

To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the [[fuel cell]]s and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=401\u2013407}}\n\nJust before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of ''Columbia'' might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When ''Columbia'' came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved.
