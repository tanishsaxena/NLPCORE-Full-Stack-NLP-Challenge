Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".|group=N}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing [[American Revolution#Origin|constitutional and political differences]] strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] [[Boston Tea Party|destroying a shipment of tea]] in [[Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]] (with the exception of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.<ref>The colony of Georgia joined later.</ref>\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate  [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]] but not as an ally of the United States. The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] and Washington then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis' army]] and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n\n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America, but the war against France continued overseas. Britain remained [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|under siege in Gibraltar]] but scored a [[Battle of the Saintes|major victory]] over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.

Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists. Jeffrey Amherst, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1778, refused a direct command in America, because he was unwilling to take sides in the war.<ref>Ketchum (1997), p. 76</ref> Admiral [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] similarly opposed a command, stating; \"I cannot draw the sword in such a cause\". The [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham|Earl of Effingham]] resigned his commission when his regiment was posted to America, while William Howe and John Burgoyne were opposed to military solutions to the crisis. Howe and Henry Clinton both stated they were unwilling participants, and were only following orders.<ref>Ketchum (1997), p. 77</ref>\n\nAs was the case in many European armies, except the [[Prussian Army]], officers in British service could [[Purchase of commissions in the British Army|purchase commissions]] to ascend the ranks.<ref>Duffy, Christopher.

Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel.<ref>Lloyd, Ernest Marsh (1908), Review of the History of Infantry, p. 155</ref> British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign.

Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: \"Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog\".<ref>Trevelyan, Volume IV, pp. 224, 34</ref>\n\nProvisioning troops and sailors proved to be an immense challenge, as the majority of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain.<ref>Minute Book of a Board of General Officers of the British Army in New York, 1781.

Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H. Kennedy 2014 163\" />\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres by the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.<ref>Frothingham pp. 152\u201353</ref><ref>Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005).

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref name=\"auto3\" /> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\" />\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.<ref name=\"Ketchum, p. 205\" /> Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.<ref>Lengel, Edward (2005).

The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|9780061139116}}, p. 16</ref>\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance.

However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was [[agrarian society|agrarian]], not urban.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports\u2014the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'', ch. 36\u201339.</ref>\n\nMotivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Michael Lanning 2009 195\u201396\" />\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405\u201348.</ref><ref>David Allison, ''The American Revolution: A World War'' (2018)</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>Philander D.

Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]].

The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,<ref>Boatner (1974), p.&nbsp;264.</ref> and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\">Duffy, Christopher (2005).

Don Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n\nFirst, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers it sent&nbsp;\u2013 they were decisive in the great victory at Yorktown in 1781.<ref>Robert Selig, ''March to victory: Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781'' (2005) [https://history.army.mil/html/books/rochambeau/index.html online].</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies'' (2006) pp. 258\u201361.</ref>  The British put a low value on intelligence, and its operations were of poor quality until 1780, when it finally inserted some spies with Congress and with Washington's command. Even then, however, British commanders ignored or downplayed threats that were revealed. The most serious intelligence failure came in 1781 when top commanders were unaware that The American and French armies at both left the Northeast and marched down to Yorktown, where they outnumbered Cornwallis by more than 2 to 1.<ref>Roger Kaplan, \"The Hidden War: British Intelligence Operations during the American Revolution.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1990) 47#1: 115\u201338. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938043 online]</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Gardner Bell|title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775\u20132005: Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xwyykzbi4pUC&pg=PA3|year=2005|pages=3\u20134|isbn=9780160873300}}</ref><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p. 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. He transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp. 429\u201336.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990) p. 220.</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Edward G.

Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces.

For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73</ref> This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war.

A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.<ref>Greene and Pole (1999), p.&nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&nbsp;545.</ref> The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict, whatever side they took; the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] tribes sided with the British.

The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British.

He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored [[egalitarianism]].<ref>William Baller, \"Farm Families and the American Revolution,\" ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28\u201344. {{ISSN|0363-1990}}.

The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels.

Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H.

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref name=\"auto3\" /> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\" />\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.<ref name=\"Ketchum, p. 205\" /> Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.<ref>Lengel, Edward (2005).

The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|9780061139116}}, p. 16</ref>\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict,<ref>Rossman, Vadim (2016), \"Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation\", Taylor & Francis, {{ISBN|1317562852}}, p. 2</ref> yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston.<ref>Edward E. Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved 10 June 2017</ref> Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was [[agrarian society|agrarian]], not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.<ref name=\"Pole 2004\" />\n\n[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Black Loyalist]] soldiers fought alongside [[British Army|British regulars]] in the 1781 [[Battle of Jersey]], from ''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]''.]]\n\nThe need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in [[Jacobite rising of 1745#Legacy|Scotland]] and [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Ireland]].<ref>Black (2001), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists.<ref>Wilson, David K (2005).

Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists.

Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H.

Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports\u2014the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Pole and Greene, eds.

The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Michael Lanning 2009 195\u201396\" />\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405\u201348.</ref><ref>David Allison, ''The American Revolution: A World War'' (2018)</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>Philander D.

Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]].

Don Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n\nFirst, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers it sent&nbsp;\u2013 they were decisive in the great victory at Yorktown in 1781.<ref>Robert Selig, ''March to victory: Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781'' (2005) [https://history.army.mil/html/books/rochambeau/index.html online].</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies'' (2006) pp. 258\u201361.</ref>  The British put a low value on intelligence, and its operations were of poor quality until 1780, when it finally inserted some spies with Congress and with Washington's command. Even then, however, British commanders ignored or downplayed threats that were revealed. The most serious intelligence failure came in 1781 when top commanders were unaware that The American and French armies at both left the Northeast and marched down to Yorktown, where they outnumbered Cornwallis by more than 2 to 1.<ref>Roger Kaplan, \"The Hidden War: British Intelligence Operations during the American Revolution.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1990) 47#1: 115\u201338. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938043 online]</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Gardner Bell|title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775\u20132005: Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xwyykzbi4pUC&pg=PA3|year=2005|pages=3\u20134|isbn=9780160873300}}</ref><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p. 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. He transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp. 429\u201336.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990) p. 220.</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Edward G.

He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored [[egalitarianism]].<ref>William Baller, \"Farm Families and the American Revolution,\" ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28\u201344. {{ISSN|0363-1990}}.

The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.<ref>Michael A.
