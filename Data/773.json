His early Roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts,{{efn|His marble bust of Laudivio Zacchia, 1627, is in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin  [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image17.html (illustrated)]}} while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes.

The monument was started in 1640, and mostly completed by 1644. The arrangement mirrors the one designed by Bernini for the Tomb of [[Urban VIII]] (1628\u201347), with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing, while at his feet, two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus. However, in Bernini's tomb, the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below, wherein the figures of ''Charity'' and ''Justice'' are either distracted by ''putti'' or lost in contemplation, while skeletal ''Death'' actively writes the epitaph. Algardi's tomb is much less dynamic. The allegorical figures of ''Magnanimity'' and ''Liberality'' have an impassive, ethereal dignity. Some have identified the helmeted figure of ''Magnanimity'' with that of [[Athena]] and iconic images of ''Wisdom''.<ref>Harriet F. Senie, \"The Tomb of Leo XI by Alessandro Algardi\", ''The Art Bulletin'' (1978); pp. 90\u201395.</ref> ''Liberality'' resembles [[Francois Duquesnoy|Duquesnoy's]] famous ''Santa Susanna'', but rendered more elegant. The tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of Urban VIII's tomb.<ref>Boucher pp. 121\u20132</ref>\n\nIn 1635\u201338, [[Pietro Boncompagni]] commissioned from Algardi a colossal statue of [[Philip Neri]] with kneeling angels for [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]], completed in 1640.<ref>Bruce Boucher, ''Earth and Fire: Italian Terracotta Sculpture from Donatello to Canova'' (Yale University Press) 2001:47.</ref> Immediately after this, Algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] with two figures: a kneeling, resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword-blow, for the church of [[San Paolo, Bologna]]. These works established his reputation. Like Bernini's characteristic works, they often express the Baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions, yet Algardi's sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "His marble bust of Laudivio Zacchia, 1627, is in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin  [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image17.html (illustrated)]"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Papal favour under Innocent X and Spanish commissions", "paragraphs": "[[File:Inoc\u00eancio X de alessandro algardi.jpg|thumb|right|''Pope Innocent X'', Capitoline Museums.]]\n\nWith the death of the Barberini [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1644 and the accession of the [[Pamphilj]] [[Pope Innocent X]], the Barberini family and fell into disrepute, resulting in fewer commissions for Bernini.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bernini: His Life and His Rome|last=Mormando|first=Francesco|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=149}}</ref> Algardi, on the other hand, was embraced by the new pope{{efn|Algardi's official 1645 portrait statue of Innocent X is preserved in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the [[Campidoglio]].}} and the pope's nephew, [[Camillo Pamphilj]].{{efn|His portrait bust of Camillo Pamphili, 1647, is at The [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image2.html illustration].}} Algardi's portraits were highly prized, and their formal severity contrasts with Bernini's more vivacious expression.{{efn|Compare the prior images with {{URL|http://www.museicapitolini.org/scripts/scheda.asp?lingua=en&id=MC1199|Bernini's Urban VIII}}}} A large hieratic bronze of Innocent X by Algardi is now to be found in the [[Musei Capitolini|Capitoline Museums]].\n\nAlgardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities.

In the villa grounds, Algardi and his studio executed sculpture-encrusted fountains and other garden features, where some of his free-standing sculpture and bas-reliefs remain.\n\nIn 1650 Algardi met [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], who obtained commissions for his work from [[Spain]]. As a consequence there are four chimney-pieces by Algardi in the [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]], and in the gardens, the figures on the fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] are also by him.

Algardi's patron's message through the relief would be that all viewers should be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn his later years Algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune.
