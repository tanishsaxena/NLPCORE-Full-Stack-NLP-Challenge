He inherited his father's valuable estates in northern Saxony in 1123, and on his mother's death, in 1142, succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of [[Billung]]. Albert was a loyal [[vassal]] of his relation, [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar I, Duke of Saxony]], from whom, about 1123, he received the Margraviate of [[Lusatia]], to the east; after Lothar became [[King of the Germans]], he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to [[Bohemia]] against the upstart, [[Sob\u011bslav I, Duke of Bohemia]] in 1126 at the [[Battle of Chlumec|Battle of Kulm]], where he suffered a short imprisonment.\n\nAlbert's entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. After the death of his brother-in-law, [[Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark]], who controlled a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon [[Northern March]], in 1128, Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked [[Udo IV, Margrave of the Nordmark|Udo V, Count of Stade]], the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar. Udo, however, was said to have been assassinated by servants of Albert on 15 March 1130 near [[Aschersleben]]. In spite of this, he went to [[Italy]] in 1132 in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in 1134 by the investiture of the Northern March, which was again without a ruler.\n\n[[Image:Adalbertus Siegel.JPG|thumb|175px|left|The seal of Albert the Bear.]]\n\nIn 1138 [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], the Hohenstaufen King of the Germans, deprived Albert's cousin and nemesis, [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, Albert was driven from Saxony, and also from his Northern march by a combined force of Henry and [[Jaxa of K\u00f6penick]], and compelled to take refuge in south Germany. When peace was made with Henry in 1142, Albert renounced the Saxon duchy and received the counties of [[Weimar]] and [[Orlam\u00fcnde]].  It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Archchamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a [[prince-elector]].\n\nOnce he was firmly established in the Northern March, Albert's covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. For  three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic [[Wends]], who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147 in which Albert took part. Albert was a part of the army that besieged [[Demmin]]. And at the end of the war, recovered [[Havelberg]], which had been lost since 983. Diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with the last of the Wendish princes of Brandenburg, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]] of the [[Hevelli]], Albert secured this district when the prince died in 1150. Taking the title \"Margrave in Brandenburg\", he pressed the \"crusade\" against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157, which his heirs &mdash; the [[House of Ascania]] &mdash; held until the line died out in 1320.\n\nIn 1158 a feud with Henry's son, [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of Saxony, was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. On his return in 1160, he, with the consent of his sons; Siegfried not being mentioned, donated land to the [[Knights of Saint John]] in memory of his wife, Sofia, at [[Werben (Elbe)|Werben]] at the [[Elbe]].{{sfn|Freller|2010|p=40}}{{sfn|Freller|2010|p=55}}{{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=35}} In 1162 Albert accompanied Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] to [[Italy]], where he distinguished himself at the storming of [[Milan]].\n\nIn 1164 Albert joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in 1169, Albert divided his territories among his six sons. He died on 13 November 1170, possibly in [[Stendal]], and was buried at [[Ballenstedt]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Freller"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "p", "value": "40"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Freller"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "p", "value": "55"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "p", "value": "35"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Cognomen", "paragraphs": "[[Image:B\u00e4r 148-KA1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Foundation of the memorial to Albert at [[Spandau Citadel]].]]\nAlbert's personal qualities won for him the [[cognomen]] of ''the [[Bear]],'' \"not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since,\" says [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], who called Albert \"a restless, much-managing, wide-warring man.\"  He is also called by later writers \"the Handsome.\"\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "Family and children", "paragraphs": "Albert was married in 1124 to [[Sophie of Winzenburg]] (died 25 March 1160) and they had the following children:\n# [[Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg]] (1126/1128&ndash;7 March 1184){{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}}\n# Count [[Hermann I of Orlam\u00fcnde]] (died 1176){{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}}\n# [[Siegfried, Count of Anhalt|Siegfried]] (died 24 October 1184), [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Bishop of Brandenburg]] from 1173\u20131180, [[Archbishop of Bremen|Prince-Archbishop of Bremen]], the first ranked prince, from 1180\u20131184{{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}}\n# Heinrich (died 1185), a canon in [[Magdeburg]]\n# Count [[Albert of Ballenstedt]] (died after 6 December 1172)\n# Count [[Dietrich of Werben]] (died after 5 September 1183){{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}}\n# Count [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernhard of Anhalt]] (1134&ndash;9 February 1212), [[Duke of Saxony]] from 1180-1212 as Bernard III\n# [[Hedwig of Brandenburg|Hedwig]] (d. 1203), married to [[Otto II, Margrave of Meissen]]{{sfn|Lyon|2013|p=241}}\n# Daughter, married c. 1152 to [[Vladislav of Bohemia]]\n# Adelheid (died 1162), a nun in [[Lamspringe]]\n# Gertrude, married in 1155 to Duke [[D\u011bpold I of Jamnitz|Diepold of Moravia]]\n# Sybille (died c. 1170), Abbess of [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Quedlinburg]]\n# Eilika\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "p", "value": "241"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "p", "value": "241"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "p", "value": "241"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "p", "value": "241"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lyon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2013"}, {"name": "p", "value": "241"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Ancestry", "paragraphs": "{{unsourced|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
