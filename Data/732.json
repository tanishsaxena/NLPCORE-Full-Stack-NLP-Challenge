Alexander was named after [[Pope Alexander II]].\n\nHe was the younger brother of King [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], who was unmarried, and his brother's [[heir presumptive]] by 1104 (and perhaps earlier). In that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of [[Saint Cuthbert]] at [[Durham, England|Durham]] prior to their re-interment. He held lands in Scotland north of the [[River Forth|Forth]] and in [[Lothian]].<ref name = \"ystlxt\">Barrow, p. 154.</ref>\n\nOn the death of Edgar in 1107, he succeeded to the Scottish crown; but, in accordance with Edgar's instructions, their brother [[David I of Scotland|David]] was granted an [[appanage]] in southern Scotland. Edgar's will granted David the lands of the former [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] or Cumbria, and this was apparently agreed in advance by Edgar, Alexander, David and their brother-in-law [[Henry I of England]]. In 1113, perhaps at Henry's instigation, and with the support of his [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] allies, David demanded, and received, additional lands in [[Lothian]] along the Upper [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and [[River Teviot|Teviot]]. David did not receive the title of king, but of \"prince of the Cumbrians\", and his lands remained under Alexander's final authority.<ref>Oram, pp. 60\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe dispute over Tweeddale and Teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between Alexander and David, although it was unpopular in some quarters. A [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] poem laments:<blockquote>It's bad what Malcolm's son has done,<br>dividing us from Alexander;<br>he causes, like each king's son before,<br>the plunder of stable Alba.<ref>Oram, p. 66 citing [[Thomas Owen Clancy|Clancy]], ''The Triumph Tree''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between Alexander and Henry of England. In 1114 he joined Henry on campaign in Wales against [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].<ref>Oram, p. 65.</ref> Alexander's marriage with Henry's illegitimate daughter [[Sybilla of Normandy]] may have occurred as early as 1107, or as at late as 1114.<ref>Oram, p. 65; a date around 1114 would place the marriage at about the same time as that of David and [[Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon|Maud of Huntingdon]].</ref>\n\n[[William of Malmesbury]]'s account attacks Sybilla, but the evidence argues that Alexander and Sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and Sybilla was of noteworthy piety.<ref>Duncan, p. 65; Oram, p. 71.</ref> Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at ''Eilean nam Ban'' ([[Kenmore, Perth and Kinross|Kenmore]] on [[Loch Tay]]) in July 1122 and was buried at [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. Alexander did not remarry and [[Walter Bower]] wrote that he planned an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at the ''Eilean nam Ban'' dedicated to Sybilla's memory, and he may have taken steps to have her [[Veneration|venerated]].<ref>Oram, p. 71.</ref>\n\nAlexander had at least one illegitimate child, [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], who was later to be involved in a revolt against [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in the 1130s. He was imprisoned at [[Roxburgh]] for many years afterwards, perhaps until his death some time after 1157.<ref>Oram, p. 77. The identity of this person may be still in question, see [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]].</ref>\n\nAlexander was, like his brothers Edgar and David, a notably pious king. He was responsible for foundations at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] and [[Inchcolm]]. His mother's chaplain and [[hagiography|hagiographer]] [[Thurgot]] was named [[Bishop of Saint Andrews]] (or ''Cell R\u00edgmonaid'') in 1107, presumably by Alexander's order.<ref name = \"ystlxt\"/> The case of Thurgot's would-be successor [[Eadmer]] shows that Alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community, perhaps because Eadmer had the backing of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Ralph d'Escures]], rather than [[Thurstan]] of [[Archbishop of York|York]]. Alexander also patronised [[Saint Andrews]], granting lands intended for an Augustinian Priory, which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.<ref>Barrow, p. 156.</ref>\n\nFor all his religiosity, Alexander was not remembered as a man of peace. [[John of Fordun]] says of him:\n{{quote|Now the king was a lettered and godly man; very humble and amiable towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.<ref>Fordun, V, xxviii ([[William Forbes Skene|Skene's]] edition).</ref>}}\n\nHe manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the [[Mormaerdom of Moray]]. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' says that Alexander was holding court at [[Invergowrie]] when he was attacked by \"men of the Isles\".<ref>Wyntoun, cxxvii.</ref> Walter Bower says the attackers were from Moray and Mearns. Alexander pursued them north, to \"Stockford\" in [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]] (near [[Beauly]]) where he defeated them. This, says Wyntoun, is why he was named the \"Fierce\". The dating of this is uncertain, as are his enemies' identity. However, in 1116 the [[Annals of Ulster]] report: \"Ladhmann son of Domnall, grandson of the king of Scotland, was killed by the men of Moray.\" The king referred to is Alexander's father, Malcolm III, and Domnall was Alexander's half brother. The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Moray was ruled by the family of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] (Mac Bethad mac Findl\u00e1ich) and [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] (Lulach mac Gille Coemg\u00e1in): not overmighty subjects, but a family who had ruled Alba within little more than a lifetime. Who the Mormaer or King was at this time is not known; it may have been [[\u00d3engus of Moray]] or his father, whose name is not known. As for the Mearns, the only known [[Mormaer of Mearns]], [[M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns|M\u00e1el Petair]], had murdered Alexander's half-brother [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]] (Donnchad mac Ma\u00edl Coluim) in 1094.<ref>MacDonald, pp. 23\u201324, deals with this affair.</ref>\n\nAlexander died in April 1124 at his court at Stirling; his brother David, probably the acknowledged heir since the death of Sybilla, succeeded him.<ref>Oram, pp.71\u201372.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Now the king was a lettered and godly man; very humble and amiable towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.<ref>Fordun, V, xxviii ([[William Forbes Skene|Skene's]] edition).</ref>"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Fictional portrayals", "paragraphs": "Alexander was depicted in a fantasy novel:<ref name=\"Saint Andrews\">Saint Andrews, Brodrick (2010), p. 99-104</ref>\n* ''Pater Nostras Canis Dirus: The Garrison Effect'' (2010).
