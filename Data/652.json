These included the concept of [[Aposematism|warning colouration]] in animals, and the [[Wallace effect]], a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to [[speciation]] by encouraging the development of barriers against [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]]. Wallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[Planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm|title=Is Mars Habitable?, by Alfred Russel Wallace|website=people.wku.edu|access-date=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution). His advocacy of [[spiritualism]] and his belief in a [[Mind\u2013body dualism|non-material origin]] for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment.\n\nAside from scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869, it has never been out of print.\n\nWallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and [[Charles Lyell]], he had no family wealth to fall back on, and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Alfred Wallace"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the painter"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Alfred Wallis"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2017"}]}, {"name": "Infobox scientist\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Alfred Russel Wallace"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alfred-Russel-Wallace-c1895.jpg"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date|df=yes|1823|01|08}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Llanbadoc]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], Great Britain{{efn|Though today in Wales, Monmouthshire's status was ambiguous at this time, considered by some as part of England.

He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position.

This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the [[London Mechanics Institute]] (current [[Birkbeck, University of London]]) . Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]] and of [[Thomas Paine]]. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.\n\nAt the end of 1839, they moved to [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]], Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at [[Neath]] in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.<ref>Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 77\u201378.</ref><ref>Ross A. Slotten. ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court:The Life of Alfred Russel Wallace''.Columbia University Press, June 2004.pp. 11\u201314.</ref> By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions, and Wallace, at the age of 20, left in January.\n\nOne result of Wallace's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], some sources have considered him to be Welsh.<ref>{{cite web|title=28.

One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]] to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and one evening he met the entomologist [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal ''Zoologist''. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.<ref>Shermer ''In Darwin's Shadow'' p. 53.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 22\u201326.</ref> William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the [[River Neath|Vale of Neath]].\n\nWallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath [[Mechanics' Institute]], founded in 1843.<ref>[http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath \"Neath Mechanics' Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110014026/http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath |date=10 November 2013 }} [[Swansea University]]. Retrieved 21 April 2013.</ref> William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).<ref>Slotten pp. 26\u201329.</ref><ref>Wilson pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymously published evolutionary treatise ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', Charles Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]''.<ref>Raby p. 78.</ref><ref>Wallace ''My Life'' pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A237.1&pageseq=287 254], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A237.1&pageseq=289 256]</ref>\n\n===Exploration and study of the natural world===\n[[File:Wallace map archipelago.jpg|thumb|300px|A map from ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' shows the physical geography of the archipelago and Wallace's travels around the area. The thin black lines indicate where Wallace travelled, and the red lines indicate chains of volcanoes.]]\n\nInspired by the chronicles of earlier and contemporary travelling naturalists, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]], Charles Darwin and especially [[William Henry Edwards]], Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist.<ref>Slotten pp. 34\u201337.</ref> In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the ''Mischief''. Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the [[transmutation of species]].\n\nWallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near [[Bel\u00e9m]], then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist [[Richard Spruce]], along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from [[yellow fever]]), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.<ref>Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98\u201399, 120\u201321.</ref>\n\nWallace continued charting the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.<ref>Raby pp. 89\u201395.</ref> On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig ''Helen''. After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last, and most interesting, two years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.\n\nWallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig ''Jordeson'', which was sailing from Cuba to London. The ''Jordeson'''s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.<ref>Shermer pp. 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=\"Slotten87-88\">Slotten pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nAfter his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|Rio Negro]] until the Indian town of [[Jativa]] on [[Orinoco River]] basin and as far west as Mic\u00faru ([[Mit\u00fa]]) on the [[Uaup\u00e9s River]]. He was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest, by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds, and by his first encounter with Indians on the Uaup\u00e9s River area, an experience he never forgot. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\") and two books; ''Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses'' and ''Travels on the Amazon''.<ref>Wilson p. 45.</ref> He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists.<ref name=\"Slotten87-88\"/><ref>Raby, Bright Paradise p. 148.</ref><ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n[[File:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration from ''The Malay Archipelago'' depicts the [[flying frog]] Wallace discovered.]]\n\nFrom 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or [[East Indies]] (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance/ |title=University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge &#124; Historical significance |publisher=Museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119040924/https://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance|archivedate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Wallace had as many as a hundred assistants who collected on his behalf. Among these, his most trusted assistant was a Malay by the name of Ali who later called himself [[Ali Wallace (naturalist)|Ali Wallace]]. While Wallace collected insects, many of the bird specimens were collected by his assistants including around 5000 collected and prepared by Ali.<ref name=ali>{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/ras.2015.0012|title='I am Ali Wallace': The Malay Assistant of Alfred Russel Wallace|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=88|pages=3\u201331|year=2015|last1=Wyhe|first1=John Van|last2=Drawhorn|first2=Gerrell M.}}</ref> Wallace's observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]].\n\nWallace collected more than 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science.<ref>Shermer p. 14.</ref> One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog ''[[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus]]'', known as Wallace's [[flying frog]]. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]]. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.\n\nAccounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and Charles Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], who called it his \"favorite bedside companion\" and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially ''[[Lord Jim]]''.<ref>Slotten p. 267.</ref>\n\n===Return to England, marriage and children===\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|A photograph of A.R. Wallace taken in Singapore in 1862]]\n\nIn 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the [[Zoological Society of London]]. Later that year, he visited Darwin at [[Down House]], and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref>Shermer pp. 151\u201352.</ref> During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including [[sexual selection]], [[warning colouration]], and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species.<ref>Slotten pp. 249\u201358.</ref> In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.<ref>Slotten p. 235.</ref>\n\nAfter a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace.<ref>van Whye, John Dispelling the Darkness, World Scientific, 2013, p. 310.</ref> However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.<ref>Shermer p. 156.</ref> In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, [[William Mitten]], an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built [[The Dell (Thurrock)|the Dell]], a house of concrete, on land he leased in [[Grays]] in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867\u20131874), Violet (1869\u20131945), and William (1871\u20131951).<ref>Slotten pp. 239\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Financial struggles===\nIn the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''.<ref>Slotten pp. 265\u201367.</ref>\n\nDespite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.<ref>Slotten pp. 299\u2013300.</ref>\n\nIn 1876, Wallace needed a \u00a3500 advance from the publisher of ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.<ref>Slotten p. 325.</ref> Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.<ref>Slotten pp. 361\u201364.</ref>\n\n===Social activism===\n[[John Stuart Mill]] was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in ''The Malay Archipelago''. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his [[Land Tenure Reform Association]], but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and [[land reform]] in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.\n\nIn 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, ''Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims'', on the subject.

In 1880, he published ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographic Distribution of Animals''. In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on [[biogeography]], spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist [[Alice Eastwood]] as his guide, exploring the flora of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how [[glaciation]] might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper \"English and American Flowers\". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' used information he collected on his American trip and information he had compiled for the lectures.<ref>Shermer pp. 274\u201378.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 379\u2013400.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Restored grave of AR Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|Wallace's grave in Broadstone Cemetery, [[Broadstone, Dorset]], which was restored by the A.

This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the [[London Mechanics Institute]] (current [[Birkbeck, University of London]]) . Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]] and of [[Thomas Paine]]. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.\n\nAt the end of 1839, they moved to [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]], Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at [[Neath]] in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.<ref>Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 77\u201378.</ref><ref>Ross A. Slotten.

One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]] to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and one evening he met the entomologist [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal ''Zoologist''. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.<ref>Shermer ''In Darwin's Shadow'' p. 53.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 22\u201326.</ref> William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the [[River Neath|Vale of Neath]].\n\nWallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath [[Mechanics' Institute]], founded in 1843.<ref>[http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath \"Neath Mechanics' Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110014026/http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath |date=10 November 2013 }} [[Swansea University]].

In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist [[Richard Spruce]], along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from [[yellow fever]]), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.<ref>Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98\u201399, 120\u201321.</ref>\n\nWallace continued charting the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.<ref>Raby pp. 89\u201395.</ref> On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig ''Helen''.

He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.\n\nWallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig ''Jordeson'', which was sailing from Cuba to London.

Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of [[natural selection]] to Lyell.

On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters&nbsp;... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\"<ref>Slotten pp. 153\u201354<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=132 p. 116]</ref> Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to [[Asa Gray]] in 1857.<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 33\u201342.</ref>\n\nCommunication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was impossible without months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.<ref>Shermer pp. 148\u201350.</ref> The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 40\u201342.</ref> but, with Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.\n\nOver the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing.<ref>Slotten pp. 157\u201362.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=In Darwin's Shadow: Excerpt|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/darwins-shadow/excerpt/|publisher=michaelshermer.com|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Did Darwin really steal material from Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=29 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509183747/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref> Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wyhe |first=John Van |last2=Rookmaaker |first2=Kees |year=2012 |title=A new theory to explain the receipt of Wallace's Ternate Essay by Darwin in 1858 |url= |journal= Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=105  |pages=249\u2013252 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01808.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | last = Ball | first = Philip | title = Shipping timetables debunk Darwin plagiarism accusations   | journal = Nature | url = http://www.nature.com/news/shipping-timetables-debunk-darwin-plagiarism-accusations-1.9613 | date = 12 December 2011 | accessdate = 26 February 2012 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2011.9613 }}</ref>\n\n====Defence of Darwin and his ideas====\nAfter the publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to England in 1862. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper \"Remarks on the Rev. S.

Darwin had come to believe that [[sexual selection]], an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick|date=1867|title=March 4,1867|journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|volume=15|issue=7|pages=509\u2013566|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1967.tb01466.x}}</ref> \n\nIn 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea.

In his 1878 book ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'', he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection.<ref>Slotten pp. 353\u201356.</ref> He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book ''Darwinism''. In 1890, he wrote a critical review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' of his friend [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'' which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the \"aesthetic preferences of the insect world\".<ref name=Nature>{{cite journal | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S424.htm | title=The Colours of Animals | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel | journal=Nature | date=24 July 1890 | volume=S42 | issue=1082 | pages=289\u201391|doi=10.1038/042289a0 | bibcode=1890Natur..42..289W }}</ref>\n\n====Wallace effect====\nIn 1889, Wallace wrote the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario: When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. \n\nThis idea came to be known as the [[Wallace effect]],<ref>Slotten pp. 413\u201315.</ref> later referred to as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]].<ref name=\"Speciation\">{{Citation | title=Speciation | author=Jerry A.

Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although [[Thomas Huxley]] had in ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\".<ref name=eiseley>{{cite book |last=Eiseley |first=Loren |title=Darwin's Century |publisher=Anchor Book |year=1958 |pages=305, 06}}</ref> \n\nHe saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that&nbsp;... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded.\"<ref name=eiseley /> For this paper he won Darwin's praise.\n\nShortly afterwards, Wallace became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]]. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of the universe was the development of the human spirit.<ref>Wallace ''Darwinism'' p. 477.</ref> These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. \n\nWhile some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.<ref>Shermer pp. 157\u201360.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter Six.

One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.<ref>Shermer p. 149.</ref> Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', occasionally in strong disagreement.<ref>Slotten pp. 289\u201390.</ref>\n\nBoth Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:\n* Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of the sperm or egg, which manifest in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, which is likely to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts.<ref>Garry Hamilton.

Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.\n* [[Epigenetic]] mechanisms, where evolution can occur in the absence of change in DNA sequence, through various mechanisms including chemical modifications to the DNA bases.\n* Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) that cause [[mass extinction]]s of species that, until the event, were perfectly adapted to their environment, such as the dinosaurs. The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.\n\nWallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but natural selection less so.  In 1889, Wallace published the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.<ref>Slotten p. 409.</ref> Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.<ref>Shermer p. 18.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "I have a rather more favourable opinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have.

His conclusion that \"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species\" has come to be known as the \"Sarawak Law\". Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species|url=http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm|year=1855|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=8 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428194531/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S020.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did [[Edward Blyth]] who thought it \"Good! Upon the whole!&nbsp;... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into ''species''.\" Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the [[progressive creationism]] of the time and wrote that it was \"nothing very new&nbsp;... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of [[natural selection]] to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a ''species sketch'' of his continuing work in May 1856.<ref>Desmond & Moore ''Darwin'' 1991, p. 438;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browne ''Charles Darwin: Voyaging'' pp. 537\u201346.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "I have a rather more favourable opinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have.

Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.<ref>Marchant, 1916. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1593&viewtype=image&pageseq=116 p. 105]</ref> In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.<ref>Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=111 p. 95]</ref> The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" while commenting that \"I believe I go much further than you\".<ref>Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=124 p. 108]</ref> Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, \"[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type]]\", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to [[Charles Lyell]] if he thought it worthwhile.<ref name=\"tendency\">{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Alfred |title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm |publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]] |accessdate=22 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429183411/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm |archivedate=29 April 2007 |url-status = live|df= }}</ref> Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters&nbsp;... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\"<ref>Slotten pp. 153\u201354<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=132 p. 116]</ref> Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to [[Asa Gray]] in 1857.<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 33\u201342.</ref>\n\nCommunication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was impossible without months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.<ref>Shermer pp. 148\u201350.</ref> The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 40\u201342.</ref> but, with Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.\n\nOver the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing.<ref>Slotten pp. 157\u201362.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=In Darwin's Shadow: Excerpt|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/darwins-shadow/excerpt/|publisher=michaelshermer.com|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Did Darwin really steal material from Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=29 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509183747/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref> Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wyhe |first=John Van |last2=Rookmaaker |first2=Kees |year=2012 |title=A new theory to explain the receipt of Wallace's Ternate Essay by Darwin in 1858 |url= |journal= Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=105  |pages=249\u2013252 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01808.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | last = Ball | first = Philip | title = Shipping timetables debunk Darwin plagiarism accusations   | journal = Nature | url = http://www.nature.com/news/shipping-timetables-debunk-darwin-plagiarism-accusations-1.9613 | date = 12 December 2011 | accessdate = 26 February 2012 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2011.9613 }}</ref>\n\n====Defence of Darwin and his ideas====\nAfter the publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to England in 1862.

Darwin had come to believe that [[sexual selection]], an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick|date=1867|title=March 4,1867|journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|volume=15|issue=7|pages=509\u2013566|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1967.tb01466.x}}</ref> \n\nIn 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea. [[Aposematism|Warning coloration]]<!--Brit. usage is colour, but coloration, see [[structural coloration]] for detailed explanation--> was one of a number of contributions Wallace made in the area of the evolution of [[Colours of animals|animal coloration]] in general and the concept of protective coloration in particular.<ref>Slotten pp. 251\u201354.</ref> It was also part of a lifelong disagreement Wallace had with Darwin over the importance of sexual selection. In his 1878 book ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'', he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection.<ref>Slotten pp. 353\u201356.</ref> He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book ''Darwinism''. In 1890, he wrote a critical review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' of his friend [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'' which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the \"aesthetic preferences of the insect world\".<ref name=Nature>{{cite journal | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S424.htm | title=The Colours of Animals | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel | journal=Nature | date=24 July 1890 | volume=S42 | issue=1082 | pages=289\u201391|doi=10.1038/042289a0 | bibcode=1890Natur..42..289W }}</ref>\n\n====Wallace effect====\nIn 1889, Wallace wrote the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario: When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. \n\nThis idea came to be known as the [[Wallace effect]],<ref>Slotten pp. 413\u201315.</ref> later referred to as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]].<ref name=\"Speciation\">{{Citation | title=Speciation | author=Jerry A.

Darwin had come to believe that [[sexual selection]], an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick|date=1867|title=March 4,1867|journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|volume=15|issue=7|pages=509\u2013566|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1967.tb01466.x}}</ref> \n\nIn 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea.

Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although [[Thomas Huxley]] had in ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\".<ref name=eiseley>{{cite book |last=Eiseley |first=Loren |title=Darwin's Century |publisher=Anchor Book |year=1958 |pages=305, 06}}</ref> \n\nHe saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life.

At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of the universe was the development of the human spirit.<ref>Wallace ''Darwinism'' p. 477.</ref> These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. \n\nWhile some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.<ref>Shermer pp. 157\u201360.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter Six.

But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:\n* Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of the sperm or egg, which manifest in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, which is likely to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts.<ref>Garry Hamilton.

The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.\n\nWallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but natural selection less so.  In 1889, Wallace published the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.<ref>Slotten p. 409.</ref> Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.<ref>Shermer p. 18.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "further", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "History of evolutionary thought"}]}], "id": 17}, {"title": "Other scientific contributions", "paragraphs": "\n===Biogeography and ecology===\n[[File:Wallace03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of the world from ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' shows Wallace's six biogeographical regions.]]\n\nIn 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, [[Philip Sclater]], and [[Alfred Newton]], Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time.<ref>Slotten p. 301.</ref> He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.<ref>Slotten p. 315.</ref> Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. \n\nThese included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently [[Great American Interchange|connecting North America and South America]]) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on [[zoogeography]] for the next 80 years.<ref>Slotten pp. 320\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that [[tapirs]] had originated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia.<ref>Bowler (2013), p. 152.</ref> Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction of megafauna]] in the late [[Pleistocene]]. In ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".<ref>Wallace ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' p. 150.</ref> He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, but by the time he wrote ''World of Life'' (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were \"due to man's agency\".<ref>Wallace ''The World of Life'' (1911) p. 264.</ref>\n[[File:Wallace-line1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|The line separating the Indo-Malayan and the Austro-Malayan region in Wallace's ''On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago'' (1863)]]\nIn 1880, Wallace published the book ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals''. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. \n\nSuch islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like [[Madagascar]]) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the [[lemur]]s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased [[glaciation]], may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great [[ice age]]s. ''Island Life'' was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.<ref>Slotten p. 361.</ref>\n\n===Environmental issues===\nWallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'' (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion.<ref>Slotten pp. 352\u201353.</ref> In ''Island Life'', Wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of [[invasive species]]. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of [[Saint Helena]], he wrote:\n\n{{quote|&nbsp;yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications!<ref>Wallace ''Island Life'' pp. 283\u201384.</ref>}}\n\nWallace's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career. In ''The World of Life'' (1911) he wrote:\n\n{{quote| These considerations should lead us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;&nbsp;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion!<ref>Wallace ''World of Life'' p. 279.</ref>}}\n\n===Astrobiology===\nWallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the [[liquid phase]].

He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time.<ref>Slotten p. 301.</ref> He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.<ref>Slotten p. 315.</ref> Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. \n\nThese included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently [[Great American Interchange|connecting North America and South America]]) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on [[zoogeography]] for the next 80 years.<ref>Slotten pp. 320\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that [[tapirs]] had originated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia.<ref>Bowler (2013), p. 152.</ref> Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction of megafauna]] in the late [[Pleistocene]]. In ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".<ref>Wallace ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' p. 150.</ref> He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, but by the time he wrote ''World of Life'' (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were \"due to man's agency\".<ref>Wallace ''The World of Life'' (1911) p. 264.</ref>\n[[File:Wallace-line1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|The line separating the Indo-Malayan and the Austro-Malayan region in Wallace's ''On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago'' (1863)]]\nIn 1880, Wallace published the book ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals''. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. \n\nSuch islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like [[Madagascar]]) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the [[lemur]]s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased [[glaciation]], may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great [[ice age]]s. ''Island Life'' was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.<ref>Slotten p. 361.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 19}, {"title": "Environmental issues", "paragraphs": "Wallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'' (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion.<ref>Slotten pp. 352\u201353.</ref> In ''Island Life'', Wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of [[invasive species]].

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.\n\nThe judge for the wager, the editor of ''Field'' magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager, and the controversy frustrated him for years.<ref>Shermer pp. 258\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Anti-vaccination campaign===\nIn the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox [[vaccination]]. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the [[germ theory of disease]] was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human [[immune system]] to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\">Slotten pp. 422\u201336.</ref>\n\nAnother factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.<ref name=\"Shermer215\"/> Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.<ref name=\"Shermer215\">Shermer pp. 215\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a [[Royal Commission]] investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. ''[[The Lancet]]'' averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, ''Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime'', attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by ''The Lancet'', which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "&nbsp;I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths.

For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some s\u00e9ance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism.

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.\n\nThe judge for the wager, the editor of ''Field'' magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager, and the controversy frustrated him for years.<ref>Shermer pp. 258\u201361.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "see also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bedford Level experiment"}]}, {"name": "inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "UK"}, {"name": "2", "value": "500"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1870"}, {"name": "r", "value": "-3"}, {"name": "fmt", "value": "c"}]}, {"name": "inflation-fn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "UK"}]}], "id": 26}, {"title": "Anti-vaccination campaign", "paragraphs": "In the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox [[vaccination]]. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the [[germ theory of disease]] was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human [[immune system]] to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\">Slotten pp. 422\u201336.</ref>\n\nAnother factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.<ref name=\"Shermer215\"/> Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.<ref name=\"Shermer215\">Shermer pp. 215\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a [[Royal Commission]] investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. ''[[The Lancet]]'' averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, ''Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime'', attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by ''The Lancet'', which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 27}, {"title": "Legacy and historical perception", "paragraphs": "[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace - Project Gutenberg eText 14558.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wallace and his signature on the frontispiece of ''Darwinism'' (1889)]]\nAs a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist.

He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.<ref>Shermer pp. 15\u201317.</ref> An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.<ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n===Selected books===\n* {{cite book\n|title=Palm trees of the Amazon and their uses.\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1853\n|publisher=London\n|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/42833\n|format=Biodiversity Heritage Library\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1869\n|title=The Malay Archipelago\n|publisher=Harper\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EldIBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain\n|isbn=9781776580736\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection\n|url=https://archive.org/details/contributionsto03wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n|edition=2nd\n|year=1870\n|publisher=Macmillan and Company\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=The Geographical Distribution of Animals\n|url=https://archive.org/details/geographicaldis01wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n|year=1876\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Tropical Nature, and Other Essays\n|last=Wallace |first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1878\n|publisher=Macmillan\n|url=https://archive.org/details/tropicalnaturea00wallgoog\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Island Life\n|url=https://archive.org/details/islandlifeorphe02wallgoog\n|year=1881\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications\n|url=https://archive.org/details/darwinismanexpo04wallgoog\n|year=1889\n|publisher=Macmillan }}\n* {{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeoftrave00wall|format=Internet Archive|edition=1889|location=|pages=|year=1889|isbn=|publisher=Ward, Lock}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Man's Place in the Universe\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1903\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39928\n|format=Gutenberg\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=My Life\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1905\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=https://archive.org/details/b31360580_0002\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n\n===Selected papers===\n* 1853: On the Monkeys of the Amazon.
