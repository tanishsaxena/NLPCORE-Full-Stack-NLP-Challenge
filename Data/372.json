This compromise arose after the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Schweitzer, the pastor's son, grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance, and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=3\u20139}}\n\nSchweitzer's first language was the Alsatian dialect of [[German language]]. At the [[Mulhouse]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] he received his \"[[Abitur]]\" (the certificate at the end of secondary education) in 1893. He studied [[Organ (music)|organ]] in Mulhouse from 1885 to 1893 with Eug\u00e8ne Munch, organist at the Protestant cathedral, who inspired Schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of German composer [[Richard Wagner]].<ref>A. Schweitzer, ''Eugene Munch'' (J. Brinkmann, Mulhouse 1898).</ref> In 1893, he played for the French [[organist]] [[Charles-Marie Widor]] (at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]]), for whom [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor, deeply impressed, agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee, and a great and influential friendship thus began.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=23\u201324}}\n\nFrom 1893 Schweitzer studied Protestant theology at the [[University of Strasbourg|Kaiser Wilhelm University]] in [[Strasbourg]]. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal, and associated closely with Ernest Munch, the brother of his former teacher, organist of St William church, who was also a passionate admirer of J.S. Bach's music.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=24}} Schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg (under [[Otto Lohse]]) and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to see Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', which deeply impressed him. In 1898, he went back to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on ''The Religious Philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and to study in earnest with Widor. Here he often met with the elderly [[Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll]]. He also studied piano at that time with [[Marie Ja\u00ebll]].<ref>George N.

These included the cults of [[Attis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Mithras]]. A developed form of mysticism is attained when the \"conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself.\" Schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found \"among the [[Brahman]]s and in the [[Buddha]], in [[Platonism]], in [[Stoicism]], in [[Spinoza]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Hegel]].\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 2}}\n\nNext, Schweitzer poses the question: \"Of what precise kind then is the mysticism of Paul?\" He locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of [[Adoption (theology)|sonship]] to God as \"mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 3 }} He summarizes Pauline mysticism as \"being in Christ\" rather than \"being in God.\"\n\nPaul's imminent [[eschatology]] (from his background in [[Jewish eschatology]]) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ. Christ-mysticism holds the field until God-mysticism becomes possible, which is in the near future.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13}} Therefore, Schweitzer argues that Paul is the only theologian who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of \"being-in-God.\" Rather, Paul uses the phrase \"being-in-Christ\" to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of \"being-in-Christ\" is not a \"static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again.\" The \"realistic\" partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13 }}\n\nOne of Schweitzer's major arguments in ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'' is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase \"being in Christ\", gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading [[justification by faith]] as the main topic of Pauline thought, which has been the most popular argument set forward by [[Martin Luther]], Schweitzer argues that Paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with God by \"being in Christ.\" [[Jaroslav Pelikan]], in his Foreword to ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle,'' points out that:\n\n{{quote|the relation between the two doctrines was quite the other way around: 'The doctrine of the redemption, which is mentally appropriated through faith, is only a fragment from the more comprehensive mystical redemption-doctrine, which Paul has broken off and polished to give him the particular refraction which he requires.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = xvi}}}}\n\n====Paul's \"Realism\" versus Hellenistic \"Symbolism\"====\nSchweitzer contrasts Paul's \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ to the \"symbolism\" of [[Hellenism (Greek culture)|Hellenism]]. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought, he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ rather than the \"symbolic\" Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through [[deification]].{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 16}} After baptism, the Christian is continually renewed throughout their lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ (most notably through the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]]). On the other hand, the Hellenist \"lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation\" and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 17}}\n\nAnother major difference between Paul's \"realism\" and Hellenistic \"symbolism\" is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter. Schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that \"Paul's thought follows [[Predestination|predestinarian]] lines.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 103 }} He explains, \"only the man who is [[Election (Christianity)|elected]] thereto can enter into relation with God.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 9 }} Although every human being is invited to become a Christian, only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through [[baptism]] can share in the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "NoteTag ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "He officiated at the wedding of [[Theodor Heuss]] (later the first President of West Germany) in 1908.{{sfn|Oermann|2016|p=101-102}}{{sfn|Brabazon|2000|p=422}}{{sfn|Pierhal|1956|p=63}}{{sfn|Pierhal|1957|p=63f}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bulletin |location=Bonn, West Germany |publisher=Press and Information Office | issn=0032-7794 |volume=9-10 |year=1962|page =[https://books.google.com/books?id=o03jAAAAMAAJ&&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=schweitzer+wedding 36]}}</ref>"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Oermann"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2016"}, {"name": "p", "value": "101-102"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Brabazon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "p", "value": "422"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pierhal"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1956"}, {"name": "p", "value": "63"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pierhal"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1957"}, {"name": "p", "value": "63f"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Bulletin"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Bonn, West Germany"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Press and Information Office"}, {"name": "issn", "value": "0032-7794"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "9-10"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1962"}, {"name": "page", "value": "[https://books.google.com/books?id=o03jAAAAMAAJ&&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=schweitzer+wedding 36]"}]}, {"name": "More citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2019"}]}, {"name": "Cleanup", "values": [{"name": "reason", "value": "\"Unsourced and unverified content, NPOV: pushes Schweitzer's views as fact, though he has been disagreed with.

These included the cults of [[Attis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Mithras]]. A developed form of mysticism is attained when the \"conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself.\" Schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found \"among the [[Brahman]]s and in the [[Buddha]], in [[Platonism]], in [[Stoicism]], in [[Spinoza]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Hegel]].\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 2}}\n\nNext, Schweitzer poses the question: \"Of what precise kind then is the mysticism of Paul?\" He locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of [[Adoption (theology)|sonship]] to God as \"mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 3 }} He summarizes Pauline mysticism as \"being in Christ\" rather than \"being in God.\"\n\nPaul's imminent [[eschatology]] (from his background in [[Jewish eschatology]]) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ. Christ-mysticism holds the field until God-mysticism becomes possible, which is in the near future.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13}} Therefore, Schweitzer argues that Paul is the only theologian who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of \"being-in-God.\" Rather, Paul uses the phrase \"being-in-Christ\" to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of \"being-in-Christ\" is not a \"static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again.\" The \"realistic\" partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13 }}\n\nOne of Schweitzer's major arguments in ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'' is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase \"being in Christ\", gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading [[justification by faith]] as the main topic of Pauline thought, which has been the most popular argument set forward by [[Martin Luther]], Schweitzer argues that Paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with God by \"being in Christ.\" [[Jaroslav Pelikan]], in his Foreword to ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle,'' points out that:\n\n{{quote|the relation between the two doctrines was quite the other way around: 'The doctrine of the redemption, which is mentally appropriated through faith, is only a fragment from the more comprehensive mystical redemption-doctrine, which Paul has broken off and polished to give him the particular refraction which he requires.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = xvi}}}}\n\n====Paul's \"Realism\" versus Hellenistic \"Symbolism\"====\nSchweitzer contrasts Paul's \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ to the \"symbolism\" of [[Hellenism (Greek culture)|Hellenism]]. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought, he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ rather than the \"symbolic\" Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through [[deification]].{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 16}} After baptism, the Christian is continually renewed throughout their lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ (most notably through the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]]). On the other hand, the Hellenist \"lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation\" and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 17}}\n\nAnother major difference between Paul's \"realism\" and Hellenistic \"symbolism\" is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter. Schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that \"Paul's thought follows [[Predestination|predestinarian]] lines.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 103 }} He explains, \"only the man who is [[Election (Christianity)|elected]] thereto can enter into relation with God.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 9 }} Although every human being is invited to become a Christian, only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through [[baptism]] can share in the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "1"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "1"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "3"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "13"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "13"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the relation between the two doctrines was quite the other way around: 'The doctrine of the redemption, which is mentally appropriated through faith, is only a fragment from the more comprehensive mystical redemption-doctrine, which Paul has broken off and polished to give him the particular refraction which he requires.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = xvi}}"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "xvi"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "16"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "17"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "103"}]}, {"name": "Sfn ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schweitzer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1931"}, {"name": "p", "value": "9"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Paul's \"Realism\" versus Hellenistic \"Symbolism\"", "paragraphs": "Schweitzer contrasts Paul's \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ to the \"symbolism\" of [[Hellenism (Greek culture)|Hellenism]].

Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.\n\nEven in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, ''The Psychiatric Study of Jesus''. He defended [[Mental health of Jesus|Jesus\u2032 mental health]] in it. In June 1912, he married [[Helene Bresslau Schweitzer|Helene Bresslau]], municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian [[Harry Bresslau]].<ref name = \"Marxsen\">Marxsen, Patti M. ''Helene Schweitzer: A Life of Her Own.'' First Edition. Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, now armed with a medical degree, Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a physician to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society's mission at [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] on the [[Ogoou\u00e9]] river, in what is now Gabon, in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. Through concerts and other fund-raising, he was ready to equip a small hospital.<ref>''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 1.</ref> In spring 1913, he and his wife set off to establish a hospital ([[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]]) near an existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft<ref>''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 6.</ref>) upstream from the mouth of the Ogoou\u00e9 at [[Port Gentil]] ([[Cape Lopez]]) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9.\n[[File:Bassin versant de l'Ogoou\u00e9-fr.svg|thumb|right|200px|The catchment area of the [[Ogoou\u00e9 River]] occupies most of Gabon. [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] is marked centre left.]]\nIn the first nine months, he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In addition to injuries, he was often treating severe [[sandflea]] and crawcraw sores, ''[[framboesia]]'' (yaws), tropical [[Ulcer (dermatology)|eating sores]], heart disease, tropical [[dysentery]], tropical [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[leprosy]], fevers, strangulated [[hernias]], [[necrosis]], abdominal tumours and chronic [[constipation]] and [[nicotine poisoning]], while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings, [[fetishism]] and fear of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Ethnic groups in Gabon|Mbahouin]].\n\nSchweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an anaesthetist for surgical operations. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking [[Galoa]] ([[Mpongwe]]) who first came as a patient.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Monfried|first1=Walter|title=Admirers Call Dr. Schweitzer \"Greatest Man in the World\"|date=February 10, 1947|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|pages=1, 3}}</ref><ref>''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapters 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] broke out in July 1914, Schweitzer and his wife, German citizens in a French colony when the countries were at war, were put under supervision by the French military at Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, where Schweitzer continued his work.<ref>[http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm Albert Schweitzer 1875\u20131965] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214021148/http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm |date=14 December 2007 }}. schweitzer.org (in German)</ref> In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical [[anaemia]], they were taken to [[Bordeaux]] and interned first in [[Garaison]] and then from March 1918 in [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]]. In July 1918, after being transferred to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922, he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in Oxford University, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, ''The Decay and Restoration of Civilization'' and ''Civilization and Ethics''. The two remaining volumes, on ''The World-View of Reverence for Life '' and a fourth on the Civilized State, were never completed.\n\nIn 1924, he returned without his wife, but with an Oxford undergraduate, [[Noel Gillespie]], as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had [[salvarsan]] for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann,<ref>Nessmann worked with the [[French Resistance]] during the Second World War, was captured and executed by the [[Gestapo]] in [[Limoges]] in 1944. cf Guy Penaud, ''Dictionnaire Biographique de P\u00e9rigord'', p. 713. {{ISBN|978-2-86577-214-8}}</ref> joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925\u20136, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included [[Suramin|Germanin]] and [[tryparsamide]]. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera [[vibrion]] (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.\n\nHe was there again from 1929 to 1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937, he returned again to Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 and continued working there throughout [[World War II]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Seaver"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1951"}, {"name": "p", "value": "40"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Monfried"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Walter"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Admirers Call Dr. Schweitzer \"Greatest Man in the World\""}, {"name": "date", "value": "February 10, 1947"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1, 3"}]}, {"name": "webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071214021148/http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm"}, {"name": "date", "value": "14 December 2007"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-2-86577-214-8"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Schweitzer's views", "paragraphs": "===Colonialism===\nSchweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus' call to become \"fishers of men\" but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European [[colonialism|colonizers]]:<ref>{{Citation | last = Schweitzer | first = Albert | author-link = Albert Schweitzer | title = On the Edge of the Primeval Forest | place = New York | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1931 | page = 115 | oclc = 2097590}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they [the coloured peoples] have suffered at the hands of Europeans?...

He thought that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its [[Ethics|ethical]] foundation.\n\nIn the Preface to ''Civilization and Ethics'' (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirming optimism of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as [[Will (philosophy)|Will]], expressed in the [[Pessimism|pessimist]] philosophies from [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] onward. Scientific [[materialism]] (advanced by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.\n\nSchweitzer wrote, \"True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness, and this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live.'\"<ref>''Civilization and Ethics'', Chapter 21, p. 253: reprinted as A. Schweitzer, ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', ([[Prometheus Books]], Buffalo 1987), Chapter 26.</ref> In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.\n\nThough we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian [[Brahmin]]ic philosophy.\n\nFor Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.<ref>''Civilization and Ethics'', Preface and Chapter II, 'The Problem of the Optimistic World-View'.</ref>\n\nSuch was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development of reverence for life, was influenced by [[Indian religions|Indian religious]] thought and in particular the [[Jainism|Jain]] principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]], or non-violence.<ref>Ara Paul Barsam (2002) \"Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life\" in:''Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century'' Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8156-2977-1}} pp.&nbsp;207\u201308</ref> Albert Schweitzer noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':<ref>Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) ''Albert Schweitzer: an anthology'' Beacon Press</ref>\n{{quote|The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind.

Known as \"The Schweitzer Technique\", it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a [[Microphone#Bi-directional|figure-8 microphone]] pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single [[Microphone#Cardioid|cardioid microphone]] is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm [[Microphone#Condenser microphone|condenser microphones]] pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Columbia recordings===\nAltogether his early Columbia discs included 25 records of Bach and eight of C\u00e9sar Franck.

Known as \"The Schweitzer Technique\", it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a [[Microphone#Bi-directional|figure-8 microphone]] pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single [[Microphone#Cardioid|cardioid microphone]] is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm [[Microphone#Condenser microphone|condenser microphones]] pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2010"}]}], "id": 17}, {"title": "Columbia recordings", "paragraphs": "Altogether his early Columbia discs included 25 records of Bach and eight of C\u00e9sar Franck.
