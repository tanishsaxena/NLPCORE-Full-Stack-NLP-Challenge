The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a [[rigid airship|rigid]] outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the [[Zeppelin]]s being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so \"airship\" came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the [[Hindenburg disaster]] in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a \"balloon\" is an unpowered aerostat and an \"airship\" is a powered one.\n\nA powered, steerable aerostat is called a ''[[Airship|dirigible]]''. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes ''dirigible balloon'' is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as ''[[blimp]]s''. During [[World War II]], this shape was widely adopted for [[Barrage balloon|tethered balloons]]; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname ''blimp'' was adopted along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.\n\n=== Heavier-than-air \u2013 aerodynes{{Anchor|Heavier than air}} ===\n<!-- Note: there are links to this section from other articles -->\nHeavier-than-air aircraft, such as [[airplane]]s, must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term ''aerodyne''. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust&nbsp;\u2014 [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic lift]], and [[powered lift]] in the form of engine thrust.\n\nAerodynamic lift involving [[wing]]s is the most common, with [[fixed-wing aircraft]] being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and [[rotorcraft]] by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]]. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate [[Lift (force)|lift]]. A ''flexible wing'' is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A ''[[kite]]'' is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.\n\nWith powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust [[Vertical and horizontal|vertically]] downward. [[V/STOL]] aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] and [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35B|Lockheed Martin F-35B]] take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.\n\nA pure [[rocket]] is not usually regarded as an aerodyne, because it does not depend on the air for its lift (and can even fly into space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.\n\n==== Fixed-wing ====\n{{Main|fixed-wing aircraft}}\n[[File:Emirates Airbus A380-861 A6-EER MUC 2015 04.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A380]], the world's largest passenger [[airliner]]]]\nThe forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the [[kite]]. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the [[wind]] blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly, and [[History of science and technology in China|were invented in China]] around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, [[wind tunnel]]s, and computer modelling programs became available.\n\nThe first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were [[glider (aircraft)|gliders]]. A glider designed by [[George Cayley]] carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853.\n\nThe practical, powered, fixed-wing aircraft (the [[airplane]] or aeroplane) was invented by [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]]. Besides the method of [[#Propulsion|propulsion]], fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their [[wing configuration]]. The most important wing characteristics are:\n* Number of wings&nbsp;\u2014 [[monoplane]], [[biplane]], etc.\n* Wing support&nbsp;\u2014 Braced or cantilever, rigid, or flexible.\n* Wing planform&nbsp;\u2014 including [[aspect ratio]], angle of [[Swept wing|sweep]], and any variations along the span (including the important class of [[delta wing]]s).\n* Location of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.\n* [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|Dihedral angle]]&nbsp;\u2014 positive, zero, or negative (anhedral).\n\nA [[Wing configuration#Variable geometry|variable geometry]] aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.\n\nA ''[[flying wing]]'' has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a ''[[lifting body]]'', which has no wings, though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.\n\n[[Ground-effect vehicle|Wing-in-ground-effect]] vehicles are not considered aircraft. They \"fly\" efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoff. An example is the Russian ekranoplan (nicknamed the \"Caspian Sea Monster\"). [[History of human-powered aircraft|Man-powered aircraft]] also rely on [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] to remain airborne with a minimal pilot power, but this is only because they are so underpowered\u2014in fact, the airframe is capable of flying higher.\n[[File:Flightline at Kabul International Airport.jpeg|thumb| Aircraft parked on the ground in Afghanistan]]\n\n==== Rotorcraft ====\n{{Main|Rotorcraft}}\n[[File:20100627 Xenon2 Krakow 1328.jpg|thumb|An [[autogyro]]]]\nRotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil section blades (a ''rotary wing'') to provide lift. Types include [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s, and various hybrids such as [[gyrodyne]]s and compound rotorcraft.\n\n''[[Helicopter]]s'' have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, producing thrust for forward flight. Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips.\n\n''[[Autogyro]]s'' have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. [[Rotor kite]]s are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.\n\n''[[Cyclogyro]]s'' rotate their wings about a horizontal axis.\n\n''Compound rotorcraft'' have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. They are nowadays classified as ''[[powered lift]]'' types and not as rotorcraft. ''[[Tiltrotor]]'' aircraft (such as the [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]]), [[tiltwing]], [[tail-sitter]], and [[coleopter]] aircraft have their rotors/[[Propeller (aeronautics)|propellers]] horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.\n\n==== Other methods of lift ====\n[[File:X-24B on Lakebed - GPN-2000-000209.jpg|thumb|X-24B lifting body.]]\n* A ''[[lifting body]]'' is an aircraft body shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they are too small to provide significant lift and are used only for stability and control. Lifting bodies are not efficient: they suffer from high drag, and must also travel at high speed to generate enough lift to fly. Many of the research prototypes, such as the [[Martin Marietta X-24]], which led up to the [[Space Shuttle]], were lifting bodies, though the Space Shuttle is not, and some [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[missile]]s obtain lift from the airflow over a tubular body.\n* ''[[Powered lift]]'' types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoff and landing ([[VTOL]]). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of powered lift types include [[VTOL]] jet aircraft (such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]]) and [[tiltrotor]]s, such as the [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]], among others. A few experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift throughout the whole flight, including personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks. [[VTOL]] research designs include the [[Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig]].\n* The ''[[Flettner airplane]]'' uses a rotating cylinder in place of a fixed wing, obtaining lift from the [[Magnus effect]].\n* The ''[[ornithopter]]'' obtains thrust by flapping its wings.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lighter than air"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Aerostat"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140223070653/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark%3A/67531/metapth172915/"}, {"name": "date", "value": "23 February 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131203131729/http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/History_of_the_Airplane/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro.htm"}, {"name": "date", "value": "3 December 2013"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140222065900/http://altereddimensions.net/2012/burrell-cannon-flies-first-airplane"}, {"name": "date", "value": "22 February 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130803021718/http://gustavewhitehead.org/news_journalism/1901_-_flying.html"}, {"name": "date", "value": "3 August 2013"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Aviations_Attic/UFOs/UFOs.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Unbelievable Flying Objects"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2014-02-10"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131102031147/http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Aviations_Attic/UFOs/UFOs.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2 November 2013"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archived copy"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2011-09-07"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120402075442/http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2 April 2012"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154830/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=879"}, {"name": "date", "value": "22 February 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140324163806/http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=AS19190224.2.104"}, {"name": "date", "value": "24 March 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140118135217/http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/innovation/innovation16.cfm"}, {"name": "date", "value": "18 January 2014"}]}, {"name": "Anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Heavier than air"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "fixed-wing aircraft"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Rotorcraft"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": " Lighter than air \u2013 aerostats{{Anchor|Lighter than air}} ", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Aerostat}}\n[[File:Colorado Springs Hot Air Balloon Competition.jpg|thumb|left|Hot air [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]]]]\n[[Aerostat]]s use [[buoyancy]] to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water.

The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a [[rigid airship|rigid]] outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the [[Zeppelin]]s being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so \"airship\" came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the [[Hindenburg disaster]] in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a \"balloon\" is an unpowered aerostat and an \"airship\" is a powered one.\n\nA powered, steerable aerostat is called a ''[[Airship|dirigible]]''. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes ''dirigible balloon'' is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as ''[[blimp]]s''. During [[World War II]], this shape was widely adopted for [[Barrage balloon|tethered balloons]]; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname ''blimp'' was adopted along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lighter than air"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Aerostat"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140223070653/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark%3A/67531/metapth172915/"}, {"name": "date", "value": "23 February 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131203131729/http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/History_of_the_Airplane/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro.htm"}, {"name": "date", "value": "3 December 2013"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140222065900/http://altereddimensions.net/2012/burrell-cannon-flies-first-airplane"}, {"name": "date", "value": "22 February 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130803021718/http://gustavewhitehead.org/news_journalism/1901_-_flying.html"}, {"name": "date", "value": "3 August 2013"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Aviations_Attic/UFOs/UFOs.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Unbelievable Flying Objects"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2014-02-10"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131102031147/http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Aviations_Attic/UFOs/UFOs.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2 November 2013"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archived copy"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2011-09-07"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120402075442/http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2 April 2012"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154830/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=879"}, {"name": "date", "value": "22 February 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140324163806/http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=AS19190224.2.104"}, {"name": "date", "value": "24 March 2014"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140118135217/http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/innovation/innovation16.cfm"}, {"name": "date", "value": "18 January 2014"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": " Heavier-than-air \u2013 aerodynes{{Anchor|Heavier than air}} ", "paragraphs": "<!-- Note: there are links to this section from other articles -->\nHeavier-than-air aircraft, such as [[airplane]]s, must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term ''aerodyne''. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust&nbsp;\u2014 [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic lift]], and [[powered lift]] in the form of engine thrust.\n\nAerodynamic lift involving [[wing]]s is the most common, with [[fixed-wing aircraft]] being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and [[rotorcraft]] by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]]. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate [[Lift (force)|lift]]. A ''flexible wing'' is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A ''[[kite]]'' is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.\n\nWith powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust [[Vertical and horizontal|vertically]] downward. [[V/STOL]] aircraft, such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] and [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II#F-35B|Lockheed Martin F-35B]] take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.\n\nA pure [[rocket]] is not usually regarded as an aerodyne, because it does not depend on the air for its lift (and can even fly into space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.\n\n==== Fixed-wing ====\n{{Main|fixed-wing aircraft}}\n[[File:Emirates Airbus A380-861 A6-EER MUC 2015 04.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A380]], the world's largest passenger [[airliner]]]]\nThe forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the [[kite]]. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the [[wind]] blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly, and [[History of science and technology in China|were invented in China]] around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, [[wind tunnel]]s, and computer modelling programs became available.\n\nThe first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were [[glider (aircraft)|gliders]]. A glider designed by [[George Cayley]] carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853.\n\nThe practical, powered, fixed-wing aircraft (the [[airplane]] or aeroplane) was invented by [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]].

Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips.\n\n''[[Autogyro]]s'' have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift.

Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered \"tug\" aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can \"soar\", ''i.e.'', gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer [[George Cayley]], whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer. Common examples of gliders are [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]], [[Hang gliding|hang gliders]] and [[Paragliding|paragliders]].\n\n[[Balloon (aeronautics)|Balloons]] drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude, either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude).

[[Kytoon]]s are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.\n\n=== Powered aircraft ===\n{{Main|Powered aircraft}}\nPowered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically [[aircraft engine]]s although rubber and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft engines are either lightweight [[reciprocating engine]]s or [[gas turbine]]s. Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional [[fuel tank]]s in the [[fuselage]].\n\n==== Propeller aircraft ====\n{{Main|Powered aircraft#Propeller aircraft}}\n[[File:WestCoastAirFloatplane.jpg|thumb|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHavilland Twin Otter]] adapted as a [[Seaplane|floatplane]]]]\n\n[[Powered aircraft#Propeller aircraft|Propeller aircraft]] use one or more [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propellers]] (airscrews) to create thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in ''[[tractor configuration]]'' but can be mounted behind in ''[[pusher configuration]]''. Variations of propeller layout include ''[[contra-rotating propellers]]'' and ''[[ducted fan]]s''.\n\nMany kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers. Early airships used man power or [[Steam aircraft|steam engines]]. The more practical [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until [[World War II]] and is still used in many smaller aircraft. Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a [[turboprop]] or [[propfan]]. [[History of human-powered aircraft|Human-powered flight]] has been achieved, but has not become a practical means of transport.

An [[afterburner]] may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust, especially on military \"fast jets\". Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the [[pulsejet]] and [[ramjet]]. These mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed by some other method. Other variants have also been used, including the [[motorjet]] and hybrids such as the [[Pratt & Whitney J58]], which can convert between turbojet and ramjet operation.\n\nCompared to propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about {{Convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, greater efficiency.<ref name=hist8>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm|title=ch10-3|publisher=Hq.nasa.gov|access-date=26 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914184628/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm|archivedate=14 September 2010}}</ref> They are also much more fuel-efficient than [[rocket]]s.

The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used [[Tip jet|jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips]].\n\n==== Other types of powered aircraft ====\n* ''[[Rocket-powered aircraft]]'' have occasionally been experimented with, and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet|Messerschmitt Me 163 ''Komet'']] fighter even saw action in the Second World War. Since then, they have been restricted to research aircraft, such as the [[North American X-15]], which traveled up into space where air-breathing engines cannot work (rockets carry their own oxidant). Rockets have more often been used as a supplement to the main power plant, typically for the [[JATO|rocket-assisted take off]] of heavily loaded aircraft, but also to provide high-speed dash capability in some hybrid designs such as the [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]].\n* The ''[[ornithopter]]'' obtains thrust by flapping its wings.

A very stable aircraft tends to stay on its flight path and is difficult to maneuver. Therefore, it is important for any design to achieve the desired degree of stability. Since the widespread use of digital computers, it is increasingly common for designs to be inherently unstable and rely on computerised control systems to provide artificial stability.\n\nA fixed wing is typically unstable in  pitch, roll, and yaw.
