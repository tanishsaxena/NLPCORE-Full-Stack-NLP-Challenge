The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is the head of the [[executive branch]] of [[Government of Alabama|Alabama's state government]] and is charged with enforcing state laws.\n\nThere have officially been 54 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors.<ref name=\"adah\" /> The first governor, [[William Wyatt Bibb]], served as the only governor of the [[Alabama Territory]]. Five people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 59, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.\n\nThe longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served 16 years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]], who took office on April 10, 2017 following Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]]'s court-mandated resignation following a guilty plea-deal amidst a corruption scandal. She is the second female governor of Alabama.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Infobox official post\n", "values": [{"name": "post", "value": "Governor"}, {"name": "body", "value": "Alabama"}, {"name": "insignia", "value": "Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg"}, {"name": "insigniasize", "value": "110"}, {"name": "insigniacaption", "value": "Seal of the Governor"}, {"name": "flag", "value": "Flag of the Governor of Alabama.svg"}, {"name": "flagborder", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "flagcaption", "value": "Standard of the Governor"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg"}, {"name": "incumbent", "value": "[[Kay Ivey]]"}, {"name": "incumbentsince", "value": "April 10, 2017"}, {"name": "style", "value": "{{ublist|[[Governor]]<br />(informal)|[[The Honourable#United States of America|The Honorable]]<br />(formal)}}"}, {"name": "status", "value": "{{ublist|[[Head of State]]|[[Head of Government]]}}"}, {"name": "residence", "value": "[[Alabama Governor's Mansion]]"}, {"name": "termlength", "value": "Four years, renewable once"}, {"name": "precursor", "value": "Governor of [[Alabama Territory]]"}, {"name": "inaugural", "value": "[[William Wyatt Bibb]]"}, {"name": "formation", "value": "{{start date and age|1819|12|14|p=1|br=1}}"}, {"name": "deputy", "value": "[[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]"}, {"name": "salary", "value": "$119,950 (2013)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/csg-releases-2013-governor-salaries | title=CSG Releases 2013 Governor Salaries | publisher=The Council of State Governments | date=June 25, 2013 | accessdate=November 23, 2014 }}</ref>"}, {"name": "website", "value": "http://www.governor.state.al.us"}]}, {"name": "ublist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Governor]]<br />(informal)"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[The Honourable#United States of America|The Honorable]]<br />(formal)"}]}, {"name": "ublist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Head of State]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Head of Government]]"}]}, {"name": "start date and age", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1819"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12"}, {"name": "3", "value": "14"}, {"name": "p", "value": "1"}, {"name": "br", "value": "1"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/csg-releases-2013-governor-salaries"}, {"name": "title", "value": "CSG Releases 2013 Governor Salaries"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "The Council of State Governments"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 25, 2013"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "November 23, 2014"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Governors", "paragraphs": "\n===Governor of the Territory of Alabama===\n[[Alabama Territory]] was formed on March 3, 1817, from [[Mississippi Territory]].
