The antibody is said to \"match\" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an [[somatic hypermutation|adaptation]] in a [[complementarity-determining region|region of the antibody]]; because of this, many different antibodies are produced, each able to bind a different antigen while sharing the same basic structure.

The immune system's response to exogenous [[antigens]] is often subclinical. By [[endocytosis]] or [[phagocytosis]], exogenous antigens are taken into the [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to [[T helper cells]] ([[CD4]]<sup>+</sup>) by the use of [[MHC class II|class II histocompatibility]] molecules on their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They become activated and start to secrete cytokines, substances that activate [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL), antibody-secreting [[B cell]]s, [[macrophages]] and other particles.\n\nSome antigens start out as exogenous, and later become endogenous (for example, intracellular viruses). Intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell.\n\n===Endogenous antigens===\nEndogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal cell [[metabolism]], or because of viral or intracellular bacterial [[infection]]. The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with [[MHC class I]] molecules. If activated [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells]] recognize them, the T cells secrete various [[toxin]]s that cause the [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]] of the infected cell. In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins, the cytotoxic cells (self-reactive T cells) are deleted as a result of [[Central tolerance|tolerance]] (negative selection). Endogenous antigens include [[xenogenic]] (heterologous), [[autologous]] and [[idiotype|idiotypic]] or [[immunoglobulin allotype|allogenic]] (homologous) antigens. Sometimes antigens are [[Autoimmunity|part of the host itself]] in an [[autoimmune disease]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002224.htm|title=Antigen|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=2015-07-30}}</ref>\n\n===Autoantigens===\nAn [[autoantigen]] is usually a normal protein or protein complex (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific [[autoimmune disease]]. Under normal conditions, these antigens should not be the target of the immune system, but in autoimmune diseases, their associated T cells are not deleted and instead attack.\n\n=== Neoantigens ===\nNeoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome. As compared with nonmutated self-antigens, neoantigens are of relevance to tumor control, as the quality of the T cell pool that is available for these antigens is not affected by central T cell tolerance.

Antigens found only on such cells are called [[tumor-specific antigen]]s (TSAs) and generally result from a tumor-specific [[mutation]]. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, called [[tumor-associated antigen]]s (TAAs). [[Cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy tumor cells.<ref name=ss15/>\n\nTumor antigens can appear on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they are recognized by [[B cells]].<ref name=ss15/>\n\nFor human tumors without a viral etiology, novel [[peptides]] (neo-epitopes) are created by tumor-specific DNA alterations.<ref name=ss15/>\n\n===== Process=====\nA large fraction of human tumor mutations are effectively patient-specific. Therefore, neoantigens may also be based on individual tumor genomes. Deep-sequencing technologies can identify mutations within the protein-coding part of the [[genome]] (the [[exome]]) and predict potential neoantigens. In mice models, for all novel protein sequences, potential MHC-binding peptides were predicted. The resulting set of potential neoantigens was used to assess T cell reactivity. Exome\u2013based analyses were exploited in a clinical setting, to assess reactivity in patients treated by either [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte]] (TIL) cell therapy or checkpoint blockade. Neoantigen identification was successful for multiple experimental model systems and human malignancies.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\nThe false-negative rate of cancer exome sequencing is low\u2014i.e.: the majority of neoantigens occur within exonic sequence with sufficient coverage. However, the vast majority of mutations within expressed genes do not produce neoantigens that are recognized by autologous T cells.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\nAs of 2015 mass spectrometry resolution is insufficient to exclude many false positives from the pool of peptides that may be presented by MHC molecules. Instead, algorithms are used to identify the most likely candidates. These algorithms consider factors such as the likelihood of [[proteasome|proteasomal]] processing, transport into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], affinity for the relevant MHC class I [[allele]]s and gene expression or protein translation levels.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\nThe majority of human neoantigens identified in unbiased screens display a high predicted MHC binding affinity. Minor histocompatibility antigens, a conceptually similar antigen class are also correctly identified by MHC binding algorithms. Another potential filter examines whether the mutation is expected to improve MHC binding. The nature of the central TCR-exposed residues of MHC-bound peptides is associated with peptide immunogenicity.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\n===Nativity===\nA native antigen is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller parts.
