Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies.

According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of \"cosmic evil.\" Thus, \"it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic\" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]].

It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism\u2014as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism \n |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf \n |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights \n |accessdate=24 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304162430/http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf\n |archivedate=4 March 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency.

The [[United States Department of State]] states that \"while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses.\" For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean \"hatred toward Jews\u2014individually and as a group\u2014that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.\"<ref name=USDS>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/40258.htm \"Report on Global Anti-Semitism\"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: \"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\" It also adds that \"such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,\" but that \"criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\" It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism\u2014as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism \n |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf \n |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights \n |accessdate=24 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304162430/http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf\n |archivedate=4 March 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency.

However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.<ref name=\"Flannery1985\"/>\n\nAlthough the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times.

The study concluded \"that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well.\"<ref>D'Acunto, Francesco, et al.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or \"Aryans\", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nRacial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nAccording to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\"<ref>Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.<ref>Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''.

Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853\u20135. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.<ref>Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64</ref> Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings.

In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.<ref name=\"Flannery1985\"/>\n\nAlthough the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times.

based on racial or ethnic grounds: \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]].\" From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, \"the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\"\n\nSome Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial antisemitism, as in his statement that \"From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the

that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.\n[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:<ref>Penslar, p. 5</ref>\n:a) Jews are savages that \"are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor\"\n:b) Jews are \"leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination\"\n\n[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:\n#All Jews are wealthy<ref>Foxman, p. 84</ref>\n#Jews are stingy and greedy<ref>Foxman, p. 89</ref>\n#Powerful Jews control the business world<ref>Foxman, p. 93</ref>\n#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism<ref>Foxman, p. 98</ref>\n#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews<ref>Foxman, p. 102</ref>\n#Jews use their power to benefit \"their own kind\"<ref>Foxman, p. 105</ref>\n\n[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as \"[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses\u2014of the community, of the country, of the world\".<ref>Krefetz, p. 45</ref> Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.<ref>Krefetz, pp. 6\u20137</ref> During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as \"scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted\", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as \"clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]\".<ref>Krefetz, p. 47</ref>\n\n[[L\u00e9on Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is \"distinct and nearly constant\" but theological antisemitism is \"often subdued\".<ref>Penslar, p. 12</ref>\n\nAn academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of antisemitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded \"that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well.\"<ref>D'Acunto, Francesco, et al.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or \"Aryans\", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nRacial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nAccording to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\"<ref>Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.<ref>Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''.

Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853\u20135.

Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.<ref>{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&pg=PA72 72]}}</ref> The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.<ref>{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&nbsp;72]}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented modern incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]]s in Europe.

It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in \"The Good Bargain\" (\"''Der gute Handel\"'') and \"[[The Jew Among Thorns]]\" (''\"Der Jude im Dorn\"'').\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.<ref name=BDE>{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}</ref>\n\nIn America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846\u20131848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.<ref name=BDE-Whitman>{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[\u00c9mile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.<ref>Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe.

Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%.

In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.<ref name=\"harris\">Harris, 2001, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\nUpon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews canceled.\n\n===== Morocco =====\n{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}\n[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years.

Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand per year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021224192927/http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm ]</ref> By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco.

In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.\nTunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.\nIn 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated.

He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title=Palestinian incitement continuing unabated|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n=====Saudi Arabia=====\n{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi-Arabian textbook controversy|Saudi textbooks]] vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in [[Jihad]] to vanquish Jews.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930s, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.<ref name=\"harris\">Harris, 2001, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\nUpon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews canceled.\n\n===== Morocco =====\n{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}\n[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)<ref name=Morris10/><ref name=\"Morocco\">For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180\u2013182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.</ref> were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.\nIn 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.<ref name=Gilbert179>[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179\u2013182.</ref>\nWhile the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)\nIn 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand per year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021224192927/http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm ]</ref> By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].\n\n===== Tunisia =====\n{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}\nJews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years.

In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.<ref name=\"harris\">Harris, 2001, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\nUpon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee.

Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand per year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021224192927/http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm ]</ref> By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco.

He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite<ref>{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},</ref> while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.<ref>{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469\u2013470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title=Palestinian incitement continuing unabated|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n=====Saudi Arabia=====\n{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi-Arabian textbook controversy|Saudi textbooks]] vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in [[Jihad]] to vanquish Jews.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite<ref>{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},</ref> while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.<ref>{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469\u2013470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title=Palestinian incitement continuing unabated|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n=====Saudi Arabia=====\n{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi-Arabian textbook controversy|Saudi textbooks]] vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in [[Jihad]] to vanquish Jews.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title=Palestinian incitement continuing unabated|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Tomorrow's Pioneers"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Racism in the Palestinian territories"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Textbooks in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}]}, {"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gaza & Palestinian Territories"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sachar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "231"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Laurens"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "467,469\u2013470"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement"}, {"name": "newspaper", "value": "The Jerusalem Post"}, {"name": "date", "value": "13 March 2011"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "19 September 2013"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Palestinian incitement continuing unabated"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated"}, {"name": "newspaper", "value": "The Jerusalem Post"}, {"name": "date", "value": "13 August 2012"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "19 September 2013"}]}], "id": 52}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi-Arabian textbook controversy|Saudi textbooks]] vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in [[Jihad]] to vanquish Jews.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse \"latent anti-Semitism,\" but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | newspaper=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}</ref>\n\n===== Netherlands =====\n{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}\nThe [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union.

One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the \"Jewish banker class\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary}}</ref>\n\n=====Poland=====\nThe [[University of Warsaw]]'s study in 2016 found that 37% of surveyed Poles expressed negative attitudes towards Jews (up from 32% in 2015); 56% said that they wouldn't accept a Jew in their family (up from 46%); and 32% wouldn't want Jewish neighbors (up from 27%).<ref>\"[http://www.timesofisrael.com/anti-semitism-seen-on-the-rise-in-poland/ Anti-Semitism seen on the rise in Poland]\".

institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election.

The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews.

Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime.

The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: \"Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change.\"<ref name=\"Campaign Against Antisemitism\"/>\n\nEvery year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, [[far-left antisemitism]] and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006.

The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, \"with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.\" The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech.

The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, \"with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.\" The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech.
