A January 15, 1941 story in the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' announced the ABC as \"an electrical computing machine\" with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would \"compute complicated algebraic equations\" (but gave no precise technical description of the computer). The system weighed more than {{convert|700|lb|kg|spell=in}}. It contained approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} of wire, 280 dual-triode [[vacuum tube]]s, 31 [[thyratron]]s, and was about the size of a desk.\n\nIt was not a [[Turing complete]] computer, which distinguishes it from more general machines, like contemporary  [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941), or later machines like the 1946 [[ENIAC]], the 1949 [[EDVAC]], the [[Manchester computers|University of Manchester]] designs, or [[Alan Turing]]'s post-War design of [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]] at [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] and elsewhere. Nor did it implement the [[stored program architecture]] that made practical fully general-purpose, reprogrammable computers.\n\n[[File:Atanasoff-Berry add-subtract module.agr.jpg|thumb|Add-subtract module (reconstructed) from Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer]]\nThe machine was, however, the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer:\n#Using [[binary numeral system|binary]] digits to represent all numbers and data\n#Performing all calculations using [[electronics]] rather than wheels, ratchets, or mechanical switches\n#Organizing a system in which [[computation]] and [[computer storage|memory]] are separated.\n\nThe memory of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer was a system called ''regenerative capacitor memory'', which consisted of a pair of drums, each containing 1600 [[capacitor]]s that rotated on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 \"bands\" of 50 (30 active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed), giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second. Data was represented as 50-bit binary [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] numbers. The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time (3000 bits).\n\nThe [[alternating current]] [[utility frequency|power line frequency]] of 60&nbsp;Hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest-level operations.\n\nThe [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic logic functions]] were fully electronic, implemented with vacuum tubes. The family of [[logic gate]]s ranged from inverters to two and three input gates. The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates. Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier, preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function. The control logic functions, which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed, were electromechanical, implemented with [[relay]]s.\n\nAlthough the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines, it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem. An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions, much like the electro-mechanical calculators and [[unit record equipment]] of the time. Selection of the operation to be performed, reading, writing, converting to or from binary to decimal, or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers.\n\nThere were two forms of input and output: primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input. The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory. (The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two [[simultaneous equations]], a trivial problem.)\n\nIntermediate results were binary, written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50-bit numbers (one equation). Each sheet could be written or read in one second. The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units, primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets' material characteristics. In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written. This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work.\n\nPrimary user input was decimal, via standard [[IBM]] 80-column [[punched card]]s and output was decimal, via a front panel display.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/computer-hist-web.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The History of Computing"}, {"name": "website", "value": "mason.gmu.edu"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "6 April 2018"}]}, {"name": "Inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US"}, {"name": "2", "value": "5000"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1939"}, {"name": "fmt", "value": "eq"}, {"name": "r", "value": "-3"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2016"}]}, {"name": "Citation ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Mollenhoff"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Clark R."}, {"name": "year", "value": "1988"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Atanasoff: Forgotten Father of the Computer"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/atanasoffforgott0000moll/page/47 47, 48]"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-8138-0032-3"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Iowa State University Press"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Ames"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/atanasoffforgott0000moll/page/47"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=v-cdBfPrxfUC"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Hudson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "David"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Bergman"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Marvin"}, {"name": "last3", "value": "Horton"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Loren"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Iowa Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781587297243"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "22"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "700"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lb"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kg"}, {"name": "spell", "value": "in"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "3", "value": "km"}, {"name": "adj", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Function", "paragraphs": "The ABC was designed for a specific purpose, the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations.
