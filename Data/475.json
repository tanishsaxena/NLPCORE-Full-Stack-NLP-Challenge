On the other hand, if [[geometry]] is developed before [[arithmetic]], this formula can be used to define [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s.\n\n====Dissection, parallelograms, and triangles====\n{{Main article|Triangle#Computing the area of a triangle|Parallelogram#Area formula}}\n\nMost other simple formulas for area follow from the method of [[dissection (geometry)|dissection]].\nThis involves cutting a shape into pieces, whose areas must [[addition|sum]] to the area of the original shape.\n[[File:ParallelogramArea.svg|thumb|left|upright|A diagram showing how a parallelogram can be re-arranged into the shape of a rectangle.]]\nFor an example, any [[parallelogram]] can be subdivided into a [[trapezoid]] and a [[right triangle]], as shown in figure to the left.  If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle.  It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle:<ref name=AF/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''bh''}} &nbsp;(parallelogram).\n[[File:TriangleArea.svg|thumb|right|upright|A parallelogram split into two equal triangles.]]\nHowever, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a [[diagonal]] into two [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles, as shown in the figure to the right.

Given a circle of radius {{math|''r''}}, it is possible to partition the circle into [[Circular sector|sectors]], as shown in the figure to the right.  Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form an approximate parallelogram.  The height of this parallelogram is {{math|''r''}}, and the width is half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or {{math|\u03c0''r''}}.  Thus, the total area of the circle is {{math|\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}:<ref name=AF/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} \u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}} &nbsp;(circle).\nThough the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors.  The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly {{math|\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}, which is the area of the circle.<ref name=Surveyor/>\n\nThis argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of [[calculus]].  In ancient times, the [[method of exhaustion]] was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to [[integral calculus]].  Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a [[definite integral]]:\n:<math>A \\;=\\;2\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx \\;=\\; \\pi r^2.</math>\n\n====Ellipses====\n{{main article|Ellipse#Area}}\nThe formula for the area enclosed by an [[ellipse]] is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with [[semi-major axis|semi-major]] and [[semi-minor axis|semi-minor]] axes {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} the formula is:<ref name=AF/>\n:<math>A = \\pi xy .</math>\n\n====Surface area====\n{{main article|Surface area}}\n[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|right|thumb|alt=A blue sphere inside a cylinder of the same height and radius|[[Archimedes]] showed that the surface area of a [[sphere]] is exactly four times the area of a flat [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of the same radius, and the volume enclosed by the sphere is exactly 2/3 of the volume of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and radius.]]\nMost basic formulas for [[surface area]] can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out.  For example, if the side surface of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (or any [[prism (geometry)|prism]]) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle.  Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]], the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle, and the resulting area computed.\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a [[sphere]] is more difficult to derive: because a sphere has nonzero [[Gaussian curvature]], it cannot be flattened out.  The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.  The formula is:<ref name=MathWorldSurfaceArea/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} 4''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup>}} &nbsp;(sphere), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.  As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to [[calculus]].\n\n===General formulas===\n\n====Areas of 2-dimensional figures====\n* A [[triangle]]: <math>\\tfrac12Bh</math> (where ''B'' is any side, and ''h'' is the distance from the line on which ''B'' lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height ''h'' is known. If the lengths of the three sides are known then ''[[Heron's formula]]'' can be used: <math>\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}</math> where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sides of the triangle, and <math>s = \\tfrac12(a + b + c)</math> is half of its perimeter.<ref name=AF/> If an angle and its two included sides are given, the area is <math>\\tfrac12 a b \\sin(C)</math> where {{math|''C''}} is the given angle and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are its included sides.<ref name=AF/> If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of <math>\\tfrac12(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3)</math>. This formula is also known as the [[shoelace formula]] and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points ''(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)'', ''(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)'', and ''(x<sub>3</sub>,y<sub>3</sub>)''. The shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known. Another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use [[calculus]] to find the area.\n* A [[simple polygon]] constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with [[integer]] coordinates) such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points: <math>i + \\frac{b}{2} - 1</math>, where ''i'' is the number of grid points inside the polygon and ''b'' is the number of boundary points.

perimeter===\n\nThe [[isoperimetric inequality]] states that, for a closed curve of length ''L'' (so the region it encloses has [[perimeter]] ''L'') and for area ''A'' of the region that it encloses,\n\n:<math>4\\pi A \\le L^2,</math>\n\nand  equality holds if and only if the curve is a [[circle]]. Thus a circle has the largest area of any closed figure with a given perimeter.\n\nAt the other extreme, a figure with given perimeter ''L'' could have an arbitrarily small area, as illustrated by a [[rhombus]] that is \"tipped over\" arbitrarily far so that two of its [[angle]]s are arbitrarily close to 0\u00b0 and the other two are arbitrarily close to 180\u00b0.\n\nFor a circle, the ratio of the area to the [[circumference]] (the term for the perimeter of a circle) equals half the [[radius]] ''r''. This can be seen from the area formula ''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup> and the circumference formula 2''\u03c0r''.\n\nThe area of a [[regular polygon]] is half its perimeter times the [[apothem]] (where the apothem is the distance from the center to the nearest point on any side).\n\n===Fractals===\n\nDoubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). But if the one-dimensional lengths of a  [[fractal]] drawn in two dimensions are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power of two that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal.\n<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\">\n{{cite book\n |last        = Mandelbrot\n |first       = Beno\u00eet B.\n |title       = The fractal geometry of nature <!--Isn't valid anymore: https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC-->\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |accessdate  = 1 February 2012\n |year        = 1983\n |publisher   = Macmillan\n |isbn        = 978-0-7167-1186-5\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170320115652/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |archivedate = 20 March 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main article", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Polygon#Area and centroid"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sys502/extra_materials/Polygon%20Area%20and%20Centroid.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Calculating The Area And Centroid Of A Polygon"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Bourke"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Paul"}, {"name": "date", "value": "July 1988"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "6 Feb 2013"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120916104133/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sys502/extra_materials/Polygon%20Area%20and%20Centroid.pdf"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2012-09-16"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "lw"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "l"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "w"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.math.com/tables/geometry/areas.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Area Formulas"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Math.com"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2 July 2012"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120702135710/http://www.math.com/tables/geometry/areas.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2 July 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web  ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Parallelogram/Rectangle"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Area of Parallelogram/Rectangle"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "ProofWiki.org"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "29 May 2016"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150620062553/https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Parallelogram/Rectangle"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "20 June 2015"}]}, {"name": "bigmath", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''A'' {{=}} ''lw''"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''l'' {{=}} ''w''"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "s"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Square"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Area of Square"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "ProofWiki.org"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "29 May 2016"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104234553/https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Square"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "4 November 2017"}]}, {"name": "bigmath", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''A'' {{=}} ''s''<sup>2</sup>"}]}, {"name": "Main article", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Triangle#Computing the area of a triangle"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Parallelogram#Area formula"}]}, {"name": "bigmath", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''A'' {{=}} ''bh''"}]}, {"name": "citation", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Problem Solving Through Recreational Mathematics"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Bonnie"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Averbach"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Orin"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Chein"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Dover"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2012"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-486-13174-0"}, {"name": "page", "value": "306"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz_CAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA306"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160513101526/https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz_CAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA306"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2016-05-13"}]}, {"name": "citation", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Calculus for Scientists and Engineers: An Analytical Approach"}, {"name": "first", "value": "K.

But if the one-dimensional lengths of a  [[fractal]] drawn in two dimensions are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power of two that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal.\n<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\">\n{{cite book\n |last        = Mandelbrot\n |first       = Beno\u00eet B.\n |title       = The fractal geometry of nature <!--Isn't valid anymore: https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC-->\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |accessdate  = 1 February 2012\n |year        = 1983\n |publisher   = Macmillan\n |isbn        = 978-0-7167-1186-5\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170320115652/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |archivedate = 20 March 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Mandelbrot"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Beno\u00eet B."}, {"name": "title", "value": "The fractal geometry of nature <!--Isn't valid anymore: https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC-->"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 February 2012"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1983"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Macmillan"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-7167-1186-5"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320115652/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "20 March 2017"}]}], "id": 28}, {"title": "Area bisectors", "paragraphs": "{{Main article|Bisection#Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors}}\n\nThere are an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle.
