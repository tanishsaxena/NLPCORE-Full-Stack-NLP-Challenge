It is in adapted [[ottava rima]] and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly [[alliteration]]. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of ''[[Hamlet]]'', craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "no footnotes", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2013"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Notes", "paragraphs": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "*[[Poems and Ballads]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "External links", "paragraphs": "{{wikisource}}\n*[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/triumph-time Complete text of the poem]\n*[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/swinburne/swinburne9.html#1 ''Victorian Web'' article on the poem]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Triumph Of Time}}\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:1866 poems]]", "attributes": [], "id": 3}]}
