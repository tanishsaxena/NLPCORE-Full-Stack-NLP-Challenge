During the following year, he began clinical work under the [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] and did laboratory work with [[Franz Nissl]] and [[Alois Alzheimer]] in [[Munich]].<ref name=WN>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/738.html Alfons Maria Jakob] at [[Who Named It]]</ref>\n\nIn 1911, by way of an invitation from [[Wilhelm Weygandt]],<ref name=NE>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIkqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT422&lpg=PT422&dq=%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&source=bl&ots=cWpu4-Qd3g&sig=ypftuqt9gBRY4AB44Fbo4mH4GII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrvZCM3qLLAhVqsoMKHQGvBBs4ChDoAQgtMAM#v=onepage&q=%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&f=false Neurological Eponyms] edited by Peter J.

Pearce</ref> he relocated to [[Hamburg]], where he worked with [[Theodor Kaes]] and eventually became head of the laboratory of [[anatomical pathology]] at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as [[prosector]].<ref name=WN/> During [[World War I]] he served as an army physician in [[Belgium]],<ref name=NE/> and afterwards returned to Hamburg. In 1919 he obtained his [[habilitation]] for [[neurology]] and in 1924 became a professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made significant contributions to knowledge on [[concussion]] and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of [[neuropathology]].<ref name=WH>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TGgBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&source=bl&ots=LtqjFg23Fr&sig=3UCfnUch2px79KIN-MOocNcIZS8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWvJ2f6aLLAhXmyIMKHUZrCRw4ChDoAQgvMAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&f=false The Man Behind the Syndrome] by Greta Beighton</ref>\n\nJakob was the author of five monographs and nearly 80 scientific papers.<ref name=NE/> His neuropathological research contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He first recognised and described [[Alper's disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] (named along with Munich neuropathologist [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]]).<ref name=WN/> He gained experience in [[neurosyphilis]], having a 200-bed ward devoted entirely to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States (1924) and South America (1928), of which, he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of [[yellow fever]].<ref name=NE/><ref name=WH/>\n\nHe suffered from chronic [[osteomyelitis]] for the last seven years of his life. This eventually caused a retroperitoneal [[abscess]] and [[Paralysis|paralytic]] [[ileus]] from which he died following operation.<ref name=WN/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2013"}]}, {"name": "Infobox scientist\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Alfons Maria Jakob"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alfons Maria Jakob.JPG"}, {"name": "image_size", "value": "150px"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Alfons Maria Jakob (1884-1931)"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "2 July 1884"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Aschaffenburg]]/[[Bavaria]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "17 October 1931 (aged 47)"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Hamburg]]"}, {"name": "nationality", "value": "German"}, {"name": "field", "value": "[[Neurology]]"}, {"name": "known_for", "value": "[[neuropathology]]"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Associated eponym", "paragraphs": "* [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]]: A very rare and incurable degenerative neurological disease.
