Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the [[Fall of Tlemcen (1517)]], was the founder of the ''[[pashaluk]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[bey]]lik'', of Algeria.

Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjar\u00e1ni\u00f0 \u2013 Heimasl\u00f3\u00f0 |language=is |publisher=Heimaslod.is |accessdate=2010-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527072348/http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |archive-date=2011-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\n\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period.

A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Jew]]ish, [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIn August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946180025|title=Africa (a-z).|last=Godfrey.|first=Mugoti,|date=2009|publisher=Lulu Com|isbn=1435728904|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=946180025}}</ref>), assisted by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}}\n\n===French rule===\n[[File:Algiers - depot and station grounds of Algerian Railway LCCN2004707260.tif|thumb|Algiers depot and station grounds of Algerian Railway, 1894]]\nThe history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of [[Algeria]] and its relationship to [[France]].

Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\".<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5.</ref> However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during [[Operation Torch]].\n[[File:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|left|City and harbour of Algiers, {{circa|1921}}]]\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]) during fighting between the [[French Army]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]], Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Geography of Algeria|Mitidja]] plain.\n\n===Algerian War===\n[[File:1962-03-22 Algeria tense cease fire.ogv|thumb|right|The \"tense truce\" between Algerian rebels, French army and the OAS in 1962]]\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u20131962), particularly during the [[Algerian War#Battle of Algiers|Battle of Algiers]] when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power.\n\n===Independence===\nAlgeria achieved [[independence]] on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n===Crisis of the 1990s===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\n\nOn December 11, 2007, two car [[11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|bombs exploded in Algiers]].

\u201cthe Citadel\u201d), Ier District of Algiers: called '' Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa '' (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by [[Almoravid]] [[Youssef Ibn Tachfin]] and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.\n* ''' [[Bab El Oued]]''': Literally ''the River's Gate'', the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond \"the gate of the river\". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n* ''' [[Edge of sea]]''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau]] designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard [[Che Guevara]] (formerly the Boulevard of the [[Republic]]).\n* ''' [[Kouba, Algeria|Kouba]]''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Of village, Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\n* [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of the city.\n* The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the heights of Algiers. These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\n* The  '''Didouche Mourad street''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the '''Grande Post office''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the '''place Audin''', '''the Faculty of Algiers''', '''The Crowned Heart''' and '''the park of Galland'''. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n[[File:Algiers, Algeria.jpg|thumb|Astronautical view of Algiers]]\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8766/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Notre Dame d\u2019Afrique and Carmelite Convent, Algiers, Algeria"}, {"name": "website", "value": "[[World Digital Library]]"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1899"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2013-09-25"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130927125818/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8766/"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "2013-09-27"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "10"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km"}, {"name": "3", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "off"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "Climate", "paragraphs": "Algiers has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').

and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into [[barracks]], and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin.

The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585).

These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.\n\nThe first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station \"Aga\" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.\n\nThe second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the {{convert|44|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.\n[[File:Alger Tunnel-des-Facultes - Place-Maurice-Audin IMG 0236.JPG|thumb|left|[[Air Alg\u00e9rie]] head office in Place [[Maurice Audin|Audin]] near the [[University of Algiers]], in Alger-Centre]]\nThe third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of \"city of wellness\". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be \"agreeable for all those which will want to combine tourism and well-being or tourism and relaxation\". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.\n\nAnother project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east from Algiers. This {{convert|90|ha|acre|0|}} site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels.
