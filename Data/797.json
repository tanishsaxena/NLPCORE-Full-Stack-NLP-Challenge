The supporters of the [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Count of Molina]] as king of Spain rose to have him enthroned. In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the West both in Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas and the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the Traditional Spanish Organic Laws such as the [[Fuero Juzgo]], the Nov\u00edsima Recopilaci\u00f3n and the [[Siete Partidas|Partidas of Alfonso X]].

The first act of President Estanislao Figueras was to extend the Abolition Act to Puerto Rico. Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889.\n\nBut the republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with the War in Cuba, and Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco. In the midst of the crisis during and after the First Spanish Republic, the [[Carlism|Carlist]] party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity, such as Catalonia or the Basque districts. By 1872, the [[Third Carlist War]] erupted. This unrest led to the creation of a group in favor of the Bourbon restoration, made by some sectors of the conservatives led by Canovas del Castillo.\n\nThe Prince of Asturias, Alfonso, was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by Canovas, which led to the June 1870 abdication of Queen Isabel II in favour of her son Prince Alfonso. The new road map, which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called 'Alfonsismo', and the moderate centrist C\u00e1novas del Castillo became the spokesman. As having Alfonso in Spain would be a problem, C\u00e1novas became responsible for his education. He sent Alfonso to the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in England, where the training Alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than in Spain, given the current atmosphere.\n\nOn 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration.  It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Mart\u00ednez Campos]], who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to [[Sagunto]], rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered [[Valencia]] in the king's name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king's plenipotentiary and adviser, [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo|Antonio C\u00e1novas]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The 29 December 1874 military coup of Gen.

In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the [[Carlism|Carlists]], in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]] and the Duke's abandonment of the struggle.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nInitially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]'s 1923 [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].  C\u00e1novas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.\n[[File:Homburg Castle Monarchs.jpg|thumb|left|Alfonso surrounded by other European monarchs, princes, and princesses at [[Homburg Castle]] in 1883.

Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of Pardo Palace (1885). It meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.\n\nThis led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able king.\n\nAlfonso's short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808\u20131874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas \u2013 Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain's first train was between Havana and Camag\u00fcey, and the first telegraph in Latin America was in Puerto Rico, established by [[Samuel Morse]], whose daughter lived there with her husband. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, ten US dollars were needed to buy one Puerto Rican peso.\n\nOn 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of [[Basilica of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha|Atocha]] in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess [[Mercedes of Orl\u00e9ans|Maria de las Mercedes]], but she died within six months of the marriage.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 4}, {"title": "Second marriage and rule", "paragraphs": "[[File:FOTOGRAFIA DEL REY ALFONSO XII, LA REINA M.
