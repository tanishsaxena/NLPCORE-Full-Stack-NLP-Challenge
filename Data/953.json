{"title": "Ambroise", "authors": ["I dream of horses"], "time_published": "2018-12-12T08:09:18Z", "sections": [{"title": "", "paragraphs": "{{other uses}}\n'''Ambroise''', sometimes '''Ambroise of Normandy''',<ref>This form appeared first in {{emc1|Marianne Ailes|Ambroise of Normandy|34-35}}</ref> (flourished {{circa|1190}}) was a [[Normans|Norman]] poet and chronicler of the [[Third Crusade]], author of a work called ''{{lang|fro|L'Estoire de la guerre sainte}}'', which describes in rhyming [[Old French language|Old French]] verse the adventures of {{lang|fr|[[Richard I of England|Richard C\u0153ur de Lion]]}} as a [[crusade]]r.  The poem is known to us only through one [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] [[manuscript]], and long escaped the notice of historians.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ambrose (Poet)|display=Ambrose|volume=1|page=798|first=Henry William Carless|last=Davis|authorlink=Henry William Carless Davis }}</ref>\n\nThe credit for detecting its value belongs to [[Gaston Paris]], although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the ''{{lang|la|[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]}}'', who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885). Ambroise followed Richard I as a [[noncombatant]], and not improbably as a court-[[minstrel]]. He speaks as an eyewitness of the king's doings at [[Messina, Italy|Messina]], in [[Cyprus]],  at the [[siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|siege of Acre]], and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAmbroise is surprisingly accurate in his [[chronology]]; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his [[pilgrimage]].  He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a na\u00efve vivacity which compels attention. He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the [[Saracens]], against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the ''Polein'' party which supported [[Conrad of Montferrat]] against [[Guy of Lusignan]]. He is rather to be treated as a [[biographer]] than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects. Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190\u20131192 in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nBooks 2\u20136 of the ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi]]'', a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by Richard, a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to Ambroise's poem. They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which Ambroise based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.{{sfn|Davis|1911}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "emc1", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Marianne Ailes"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Ambroise of Normandy"}, {"name": "3", "value": "34-35"}]}, {"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1190"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "fro"}, {"name": "2", "value": "L'Estoire de la guerre sainte"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "fr"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Richard I of England|Richard C\u0153ur de Lion]]"}]}, {"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Ambrose (Poet)"}, {"name": "display", "value": "Ambrose"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "page", "value": "798"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Henry William Carless"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Davis"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Henry William Carless Davis"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "la"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Davis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Published edition", "paragraphs": "\n* Ambroise, ''L\u00b4Estoire de la guerre sainte''.
