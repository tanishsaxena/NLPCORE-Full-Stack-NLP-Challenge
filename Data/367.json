Races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of the earliest events were effectively [[Classic trials|reliability trials]], aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines. By the 1930s, specialist racing cars had developed.\n\nThere are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the motorsport"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the video game"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Auto Racing (video game)"}]}, {"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Auto race"}]}, {"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Racing cars"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the Welsh pop band"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Racing Cars"}]}, {"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Race driver"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the racing simulation video game series"}, {"name": "3", "value": "TOCA Race Driver"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2012"}]}, {"name": "Infobox sport\n", "values": [{"name": "image", "value": "Three-wide multiple row back.JPG"}, {"name": "imagesize", "value": "320px"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "[[Jimmie Johnson]] leads the field racing three-wide multiple rows back at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in the [[2015 Daytona 500]]."}, {"name": "union", "value": "[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]"}, {"name": "first", "value": "August 30, 1867"}, {"name": "firstlabel", "value": "First contested"}, {"name": "mgender", "value": "Yes"}, {"name": "category", "value": "Outdoor and Indoor"}, {"name": "olympic", "value": "[[1900 Summer Olympics]] (demonstration only)"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/motor-racing"}, {"name": "title", "value": "motor racing (noun) definition and synonyms Macmillan Dictionary"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.macmillandictionary.com"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2019-09-02"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "{{Main|History of auto racing}}\n[[File:1894 paris-rouen - albert lema\u00eetre (peugeot 3hp) 1st.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Lema\u00eetre]] classified first in his [[Peugeot Type 5]] 3hp in the [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris\u2013Rouen]].<!-- Note discrepancy that text below states that Peugot (the car manufacturer) was the winner. -->]]\n[[File:Fernand Gabriel Mors Paris-Madrid 1903.jpg|thumb|Fernand Gabriel driving a [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]] in [[Paris\u2013Madrid race|Paris-Madrid]] 1903]]\n[[File:Brooklands Members' Banking from bridge.jpg|thumb|A remaining section of the [[Brooklands]] track in 2007]]\n\nThe first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Old Trafford]], a distance of eight miles.

The first NASCAR \"Strictly Stock\" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].\n\nFrom 1962, sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars, with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jenkinson |first1=Dennis |title=The Automobile Year Book of Sports Car Racing |date=1983 |publisher=Motorbooks International |isbn=9782880011291}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1972 through 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] cigarette brand [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 48 to 31 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's \"modern era\".\n\nThe IMSA GT Series evolved into the [[American Le Mans Series]], which ran its first season in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Perez|first=A.J.|title=Le Mans series showcases prototype race cars|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2007-08-29-lemans-motor_N.htm |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |work=USA Today |publisher=Gannett Company |date=August 30, 2007}}</ref> The European races eventually became the closely related [[Le Mans Series]], both of which mix prototypes and GTs.\n\nTurismo Carretera (Road racing, lit., Road Touring) is a popular touring car racing series in Argentina, and the oldest car racing series still active in the world.

These cars are heavily based around technology and their aerodynamics. With the highest speed record set in 2005 by Juan Pablo Montoya hitting 373&nbsp;km/h (232&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/fastest-f1-records|title=Blink and you'll miss these F1 records|work=Red Bull|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}</ref> Some of the most prominent races are the Monaco Grand Prix, the Italian Grand Prix, and the British Grand Prix. The season ends with the crowning of the World Championship for drivers and constructors.\n\nIn single-seater ([[open-wheel]]), the wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce [[downforce]] and enhance adhesion to the track. In Europe and Asia, open-wheeled racing is commonly referred to as 'Formula', with appropriate hierarchical suffixes. In North America, the 'Formula' terminology is not followed (with the exception of F1). The sport is usually arranged to follow an international format (such as F1), a regional format (such as the Formula 3 Euro Series), and/or a domestic, or country-specific, format (such as the German Formula 3 championship, or the British Formula Ford).\n\nIn the United States, the most popular series is the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]], more commonly known as the IndyCar Series and previously known as [[Champ Car|CART]]. The cars have traditionally been similar though less technologically sophisticated than [[F1 cars]], with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs. While these cars are not as technologically advanced, they are faster, mainly because they compete on oval race tracks, being able to average a lap at 388&nbsp;km/h (241&nbsp;mph). The series' biggest race is the [[Indianapolis 500]], which is commonly referred to as \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" due to being the longest continuously run race and having the largest crowd for a single-day sporting event (350,000+).\n\nThe other major international single-seater racing series is [[Formula Two|Formula 2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[GP2 Series]]). Regional series include [[Formula Nippon]] and [[Formula V6 Asia]] (specifically in Asia), [[Formula Renault 3.5]] (also known as the World Series by Renault, succession series of [[World Series by Nissan]]), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Palmer Audi]] and [[Formula Atlantic]]. In 2009, the [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]] brought about the revival of the F2 series. Domestic, or country-specific, series include Formula Three and Formula Renault, with the leading introductory series being [[Formula Ford]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nSingle-seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers. There exist many amateur racing clubs. In the UK, the major club series are the [[Monoposto Racing Club]], BRSCC F3 (Formerly ClubF3, formerly ARP F3), Formula Vee and Club Formula Ford. Each series caters for a section of the market, with some primarily providing low-cost racing, while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series (BRSCC F3).\n\nThere are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts. [[Formula Ford]] represents the most popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts. The series is still the preferred option, as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The [[Star Mazda Series]] is another entry-level series.\n\nStudents at colleges and universities can also take part in single-seater racing through the [[Formula SAE]] competition, which involves designing and building a single-seater car in a multidisciplinary team and racing it at the competition. This also develops other soft skills, such as teamwork, while promoting motorsport and engineering.\n\nThe world's first all-female Formula racing team was created in 2006. The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an MTV reality pilot, which was shot at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].\n\nIn December 2005, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] gave approval to [[Superleague Formula]] racing, which debuted in 2008, whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]]\n\nAfter 25 years away from the sport, former [[Formula 2]] champion [[Jonathan Palmer]] reopened the F2 category again; most drivers have graduated from the [[Formula Palmer Audi]] series. The category is officially registered as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Formula Two championship. Most rounds have two races and are support races to the [[FIA World Touring Car Championship]].\n\n===Touring car racing===\n{{Main|Touring car racing}}\n[[File:2012 WTCC Race of Japan (Race 1) opening lap.jpg|thumb|Opening lap of [[2012 WTCC season|2012 WTCC]] Race of Japan]]\n\nTouring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production-derived race cars. It often features full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.\n\nThe major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the [[Supercars Championship]] (Australia), [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM), and the [[World Touring Car Championship]]. The [[European Touring Car Cup]] is a one-day event open to [[Super 2000]] specification touring cars from Europe's many national championships.\n\nThe [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S. The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory-derived vehicles on various local circuits.\n\n===Sports car racing===\n{{Main|Sports car racing}}\n\n[[File:2011 FIA GT1 Silverstone 2.jpg|thumb|[[FIA GT1 World Championship|FIA GT1]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in [[2011 FIA GT1 World Championship season|2011]]]]\n[[File:Audi R18 e-tron quattro at 2013 Le Mans.jpg|thumb|The [[Audi R18]], a [[Le Mans Prototype]] car, during an [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]]]]\n\nIn [[sports car racing]], production-derived versions of [[sports cars]], also known as grand tourers (GTs), and purpose-built [[sports prototype]] cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits. The premier championship series of sports car racing is the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The main series for GT car racing is the [[Blancpain GT Series]], divided into two separate championships, the [[Blancpain GT World Challenge Europe]] and the [[Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup]]. This series has formed after the folding of the various FIA GT championships.\n\nOther major GT championships include the [[Blancpain GT World Challenge America]], [[Blancpain GT World Challenge Asia]], [[Super GT]], and the [[International GT Open]]. There are minor regional and national GT series using mainly GT4 and GT3 cars featuring both amateur and professional drivers.\n\nSports prototypes, unlike GT cars, do not rely on road-legal cars as a base. They are closed-wheel and often closed-cockpit purpose-built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing. They have much lower weight and more down force compared to GT cars, making them much faster. They are raced in the 24 hours of Le Mans (held annually since 1923) and in the (European) [[Le Mans series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]] and the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]. These cars are referred to as [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] (Le Mans prototype) cars with LMP1 being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful LMP2 cars run by privateer teams. All three Le Mans Series run GT cars in addition to Le Mans Prototypes; these cars have different restrictions than the FIA GT cars.\n\nAnother prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States; the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand-Am]], which began in 2000, sanctions its own endurance series, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]], which consists of slower and lower-cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars. The [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[American Le Mans Series]] announced a merger between the two series forming the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] starting in 2014.\n\nThese races are often conducted over long distances, at least {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}}, and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers, switching every few hours. Due to the performance difference between production-based sports cars and purpose-built sports prototypes, one race usually involves several racing classes, each fighting for their own championship.\n\nFamous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]], [[Spa 24 Hours|24 Hours of Spa]]-Franchorchamps, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]], and the {{convert|1000|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]]. There is also the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring|24 Hours of the N\u00fcrburgring]] on the infamous Nordschleife track and the [[Dubai 24 Hour]], which is aimed at GT3 and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro-am drivers.\n\n===Production-car racing===\n{{Main|Production car racing}}\n\nProduction-car racing, otherwise known as \"showroom stock\" in the US, is an economical and rules-restricted version of touring-car racing, mainly used to restrict costs. Numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars.\n\nMost series follow the [[Group N]] regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that are run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]'s Firehawk Series, which ran in the 1980s and 1990s all over the United States.\n\n===One-make racing===\n{{See also|One-Design|Spec racing}}\n\nOne-make, or single marque, championships often employ production-based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturer's range. There are numerous notable one-make formulae from various countries and regions, some of which&nbsp;\u2013 such as the [[Porsche Supercup]] and, previously, [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]&nbsp;\u2013 have fostered many distinct national championships. Single marque series are often found at club level, to which the production-based cars, limited modifications, and close parity in performance are very well suited. Some of the better-known single-make series are the [http://www.mini7.co.uk Mini 7 Championship] (Europe's longest-running one make championship), the [[Radical European Masters]], [http://www.minichallenge.co.uk John Cooper Mini Challenge], [[Renault Clio Cup|Clio Cup]], [[Ginetta Cars|Ginettas]], [[Caterham Racing|Caterhams]], [[Kumho BMW Championship|BMWs]], and [[MaX5 Racing Championship|MX5s]]. There are also single-chassis [[Open wheel car|single seater]] formulae, such as [[Formula Renault]] and [[Formula BMW]], usually as \"feeder\" series for \"senior\" race formula (in the fashion of [[farm team]]s).\n\n===Time Attack Series===\n{{Main|Time attack}}\n[[File:ECR33 Serieas II Modified for TA Racing.jpg|thumb|ECR33 Serieas II Modified for [[Time attack|Time Attack racing]]]]\n\nTime attack events began in Japan in the mid-1960s. They have since spread around the world.\nTime Attack racing is a type of motorsport in which the racers compete for the best lap time. Each vehicle is timed through numerous circuits of the track. The racers make a preliminary circuit, then run the timed laps, and then finish with a cool-down lap.\nTime Attack and time trial events differ by competition format and rules. Time Attack has a limited number of laps, time trial has open sessions.\nUnlike other timed motorsport disciplines such as sprinting and hillclimbing, the car is required to start off under full rolling start conditions following a warm up lap in which they will have to accelerate out as fast as possible to determine how fast they enter their timed lap. Commonly, as the cars are modified road going cars, they are required to have tires authorized for road use.\n\n===Stock car racing===\n{{Main|Stock car racing}}\n[[File:Green flag at Daytona.JPG|thumb|NASCAR green flag start at [[Daytona International Speedway]] for the [[2015 Daytona 500]]]]\n[[File:BrettSontag2010LateModelRockfordSpeedway.jpg|thumb|An [[ASA Late Model Series]] stock car on an asphalt track]]\n\nIn North America, [[stock car racing]] is the most popular form of auto racing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer |first=Jenna |title=Addition of IndyCar champ Hornish will give Penske third Cup team|url= http://espn.go.com/racing/news/story?id=3099978&seriesId=2 |accessdate=February 8, 2009|work=ESPN News Services |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=November 8, 2007|location=Charlotte, North Carolina}}</ref> Primarily raced on [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], stock cars vaguely resemble production cars, but are in fact purpose-built racing machines that are built to tight specifications and, together with touring cars, also called [[Silhouette racing car]]s.\n\nThe largest stock car racing governing body is [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing). NASCAR's premier series is the [[Monster Energy Cup Series]], its most famous races being the [[Daytona 500]], the [[Bojangles Southern 500|Southern 500]], the [[Coca-Cola 600]], and the [[Brickyard 400]]. NASCAR also runs several feeder series, including the [[Xfinity Series]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] (a [[pickup truck]] racing series). The series conduct races across the entire [[continental United States]]. The [[NASCAR Pinty's Series]] conducts races across Canada and the [[NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series]] conducts races across Mexico.\n\nNASCAR also governs several smaller regional series, such as the [[Whelen Modified Tour]]. Modified cars are best described as open-wheel cars. Modified cars have no parts related to the stock vehicle for which they are named after. A number of modified cars display a \"manufacturer's\" logo and \"vehicle name\", yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer.\n\nThere are also other stock car governing bodies, most notably the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] (ARCA).\n\nIn the UK, [[British Stock car racing]] is also referred to as \"Short Circuit Racing\". UK Stock car racing started in the 1950s and grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s. Events take place on shale or tarmac tracks&nbsp;\u2013 usually around 1/4&nbsp;mile long. The governing bodies for the sport are the Oval Racing Council (ORC) and BriSCA. Both bodies are made up of individual stadium promoters. There are around 35 tracks in the UK and upwards of 7000 active drivers. The sport is split into three basic divisions&nbsp;\u2013 distinguished by the rules regarding car contact during racing. The most famous championship is the [[BriSCA F1 Stock Cars]]. Full-contact formulas include Bangers, Bombers and Rookie Bangers&nbsp;\u2013 and racing features Demolitions Derbies, Figure of Eight and Oval Racing.\n\nSemi Contact Formulas include BriSCA F1, F2 and Superstox&nbsp;\u2013 where bumpers are used tactically.\n\nNon-contact formulas include National Hot Rods, Stock Rods, and Lightning Rods.\n\n===Rallying===\n{{Main|Rallying}}\n[[File:Andreas Mikkelsen - WRC Portugal 2013 (8647047945).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Mikkelsen]] driving a [[Volkswagen Polo R WRC|VW Polo R WRC]] during the [[2013 Rally de Portugal]]]]\n[[File:Longford extreme slide 2.jpg|thumb|[[Holden V8 engine|Holden V8-powered]] 1980 [[Mercedes-Benz SL-Class|Mercedes]] at the 2010 [[Targa Tasmania]]]]\n\n[[Rallying]] at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] road-legal production-based cars; [[Group N]] production cars and more modified [[Group A]] cars. Cars compete on closed public roads or off-road areas on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers \"rally\" to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of \"special stages\" on any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as pace notes. During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event's special stages, including penalties.\n\nThe top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), first contested in 1973, but there are also regional championships, and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], [[Rally Argentina]], [[Rally Finland]], and [[Rally GB]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a [[rally raid]]) is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]], conceived in 1978. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]], which are popular with amateurs, making up the \"grass roots\" of motor sports. Cars at this level may not comply fully with the requirements of [[group A]] or [[group N]] [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]].\n\nOther major rally events include the [[British Rally Championship]], [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]], [[African Rally Championship]], [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship]], and endurance rally events like the [[Dakar Rally]].\n\nThe [[Targa Tasmania]], held on the Australian island state of Tasmania and run annually since 1992, takes its name from the [[Targa Florio]], a former motoring event held on the island of [[Sicily]]. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the [[Mille Miglia]], the [[Coupe des Alpes]], and the [[Tour de Corse]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Similarly named events around the world include the [[Targa Newfoundland]] based in Canada, [[Targa West]] based in Western Australia, [[Targa New Zealand]], and other smaller events.\n\n===Drag racing===\n{{Main|Drag racing}}\n[[File:Tarlton-Drag racing-004.jpg|thumb|Jet-propelled [[drag racing|dragster]] in Tarlton, Gauteng, [[South Africa]]]]\n[[File:1970 AMC Javelin dragstrip car-r.jpg|thumb|Two modified [[American Motors Corporation|AMCs]] launching at a [[dragstrip]]]]\n\nIn drag racing, the objective is to complete a given straight-line distance, from a standing start, ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane. This distance is traditionally {{convert|1/4|mi|m}}, though {{convert|1/8|mi|m}} has become popular since the 1990s. The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built [[drag racing|dragster]]. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the {{frac|4}} mile in 12 to 16&nbsp;seconds, whereas a [[top fuel dragster]] takes 4.5&nbsp;seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to {{convert|530|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Drag racing was organized as a sport by [[Wally Parks]] in the early 1950s through the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA). The NHRA was formed to discourage [[street racing]].\n\nWhen launching, a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 3.4 [[g-force|g]] (33&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is 4&nbsp;g (39&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), more than the [[Space Shuttle]] experiences. A top fuel car can be heard over {{convert|8|mi|km}} away and can generate a reading from 1.5 to 3.9 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://topfuel.nhra.com/blog/nhra-notebook/2007/07/26/22660/ | title=Herbert's engine thunders to 3.9 on Richter scale | date=July 26, 2007 | work=NHRA.com | accessdate=August 11, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<!-- Need more details to verify this reference:<ref>NHRA Mile High Nationals 2001, and 2002 testing from the National Seismology Center.</ref> -->\n\nDrag racing is two cars head-to-head, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]]) using an index (a lowest e.t. allowed), and cars running under (quicker than) their index \"break out\" and lose. The slowest cars, bracket racers, are also handicapped, but rather than an index, they use a [[Drag racing#Dial-in|dial-in]].\n\n===Off-road racing===\n{{Main|Off-road racing}}\n\n[[File:Stockmini.jpg|thumb|[[Rod Hall (racer)|Rod Hall]] in a [[Hummer H3]] during a [[Best in the Desert]] race]]\n\nIn [[off-road racing]], various classes of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous [[Baja 1000]]. Another format for off-road racing happens on closed-course [[Short course off road racing|short course tracks]] such as [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, short course was extended to racing inside stadiums in the [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]]; this format was revived by [[Robby Gordon]] in 2013 with his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] series.\n\nIn Europe, \"offroad\" refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the [[Paris-Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar]], Master Rallye or European \"bajas\" are called \"cross-country rallies.\"\n\n===Kart racing===\n[[File:AtwaterSat394.jpg|thumb|A sprint kart race in Atwater California hosted by the International Karting Federation]]\n\n{{Main|Kart racing}}\nThe modern kart was invented by Art Ingels, a fabricator at the Indianapolis-car manufacturer Kurtis-Kraft, in Southern California in 1956. Ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube-frame chassis weighing less than 100&nbsp;lb. Ingels, and everyone else who drove the kart, were startled at its performance capabilities. The sport soon blossomed in Southern California, and quickly spread around the world. Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, [[kart racing]], or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]]. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably [[Wayne Rainey]], who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to race, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.\n\nDespite their diminutive size, karting's most powerful class, [[superkart]], can have a power-to-weight ratio of 440&nbsp;hp/tonne.\n\n===Historical racing===\n[[File:Monterey Historic.jpg|thumb|[[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], [[Monterey]], 2008]]\n\n{{Main|Historic motorsport}}\nAs modern motor racing is centered on modern technology with a lots of corporate sponsors and politics involved, [[historical racing]] tends to be the opposite. Because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented, reducing corporate sponsorship and politics. Events are regulated to only allow cars of a certain era to participate. The only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing. A historical event can be of a number of different motorsport disciplines.\nNotably some of the most famous events of them all are the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] and [[Goodwood Revival]] in Britain and [[Monterey Historic]] in the United States. Championships range from \"grass root\" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] racing to the [[FIA Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship]] for classic [[Formula One]] chassis.\n\nWhile there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing, this branch of [[auto sport]] tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and less competitive in its approach.\n\n===Other categories===\n{{see also|Category:Auto racing by type}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Autocross]]\n* [[Autograss]]\n* [[Banger racing]]\n* [[Board track racing]]\n*

Technology]]]]\n[[File:In Car Micheal Fitzgerald Cork Racing.jpg|thumb|Racing Driver's View]]\n\nThe two most popular varieties of open-wheel [[road racing]] are [[Formula One]] and the [[IndyCar Series]].\nFormula One is a European-based series that runs only [[street circuit]] and [[race track]]s. These cars are heavily based around technology and their aerodynamics. With the highest speed record set in 2005 by Juan Pablo Montoya hitting 373&nbsp;km/h (232&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/fastest-f1-records|title=Blink and you'll miss these F1 records|work=Red Bull|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}</ref> Some of the most prominent races are the Monaco Grand Prix, the Italian Grand Prix, and the British Grand Prix. The season ends with the crowning of the World Championship for drivers and constructors.\n\nIn single-seater ([[open-wheel]]), the wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce [[downforce]] and enhance adhesion to the track. In Europe and Asia, open-wheeled racing is commonly referred to as 'Formula', with appropriate hierarchical suffixes. In North America, the 'Formula' terminology is not followed (with the exception of F1). The sport is usually arranged to follow an international format (such as F1), a regional format (such as the Formula 3 Euro Series), and/or a domestic, or country-specific, format (such as the German Formula 3 championship, or the British Formula Ford).\n\nIn the United States, the most popular series is the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]], more commonly known as the IndyCar Series and previously known as [[Champ Car|CART]]. The cars have traditionally been similar though less technologically sophisticated than [[F1 cars]], with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs. While these cars are not as technologically advanced, they are faster, mainly because they compete on oval race tracks, being able to average a lap at 388&nbsp;km/h (241&nbsp;mph). The series' biggest race is the [[Indianapolis 500]], which is commonly referred to as \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" due to being the longest continuously run race and having the largest crowd for a single-day sporting event (350,000+).\n\nThe other major international single-seater racing series is [[Formula Two|Formula 2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[GP2 Series]]). Regional series include [[Formula Nippon]] and [[Formula V6 Asia]] (specifically in Asia), [[Formula Renault 3.5]] (also known as the World Series by Renault, succession series of [[World Series by Nissan]]), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Palmer Audi]] and [[Formula Atlantic]]. In 2009, the [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]] brought about the revival of the F2 series. Domestic, or country-specific, series include Formula Three and Formula Renault, with the leading introductory series being [[Formula Ford]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nSingle-seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers. There exist many amateur racing clubs. In the UK, the major club series are the [[Monoposto Racing Club]], BRSCC F3 (Formerly ClubF3, formerly ARP F3), Formula Vee and Club Formula Ford. Each series caters for a section of the market, with some primarily providing low-cost racing, while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series (BRSCC F3).\n\nThere are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts. [[Formula Ford]] represents the most popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts. The series is still the preferred option, as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The [[Star Mazda Series]] is another entry-level series.\n\nStudents at colleges and universities can also take part in single-seater racing through the [[Formula SAE]] competition, which involves designing and building a single-seater car in a multidisciplinary team and racing it at the competition. This also develops other soft skills, such as teamwork, while promoting motorsport and engineering.\n\nThe world's first all-female Formula racing team was created in 2006. The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an MTV reality pilot, which was shot at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].\n\nIn December 2005, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] gave approval to [[Superleague Formula]] racing, which debuted in 2008, whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]]\n\nAfter 25 years away from the sport, former [[Formula 2]] champion [[Jonathan Palmer]] reopened the F2 category again; most drivers have graduated from the [[Formula Palmer Audi]] series. The category is officially registered as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Formula Two championship. Most rounds have two races and are support races to the [[FIA World Touring Car Championship]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Formula racing"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Open wheel car"}]}, {"name": "Cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.redbull.com/au-en/fastest-f1-records"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Blink and you'll miss these F1 records"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Red Bull"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-08-08"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2011"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Touring car racing", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Touring car racing}}\n[[File:2012 WTCC Race of Japan (Race 1) opening lap.jpg|thumb|Opening lap of [[2012 WTCC season|2012 WTCC]] Race of Japan]]\n\nTouring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production-derived race cars. It often features full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.\n\nThe major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the [[Supercars Championship]] (Australia), [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM), and the [[World Touring Car Championship]]. The [[European Touring Car Cup]] is a one-day event open to [[Super 2000]] specification touring cars from Europe's many national championships.\n\nThe [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S. The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory-derived vehicles on various local circuits.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Touring car racing"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Sports car racing", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Sports car racing}}\n\n[[File:2011 FIA GT1 Silverstone 2.jpg|thumb|[[FIA GT1 World Championship|FIA GT1]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in [[2011 FIA GT1 World Championship season|2011]]]]\n[[File:Audi R18 e-tron quattro at 2013 Le Mans.jpg|thumb|The [[Audi R18]], a [[Le Mans Prototype]] car, during an [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]]]]\n\nIn [[sports car racing]], production-derived versions of [[sports cars]], also known as grand tourers (GTs), and purpose-built [[sports prototype]] cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits. The premier championship series of sports car racing is the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The main series for GT car racing is the [[Blancpain GT Series]], divided into two separate championships, the [[Blancpain GT World Challenge Europe]] and the [[Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup]]. This series has formed after the folding of the various FIA GT championships.\n\nOther major GT championships include the [[Blancpain GT World Challenge America]], [[Blancpain GT World Challenge Asia]], [[Super GT]], and the [[International GT Open]]. There are minor regional and national GT series using mainly GT4 and GT3 cars featuring both amateur and professional drivers.\n\nSports prototypes, unlike GT cars, do not rely on road-legal cars as a base. They are closed-wheel and often closed-cockpit purpose-built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing. They have much lower weight and more down force compared to GT cars, making them much faster. They are raced in the 24 hours of Le Mans (held annually since 1923) and in the (European) [[Le Mans series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]] and the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]. These cars are referred to as [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] (Le Mans prototype) cars with LMP1 being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful LMP2 cars run by privateer teams. All three Le Mans Series run GT cars in addition to Le Mans Prototypes; these cars have different restrictions than the FIA GT cars.\n\nAnother prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States; the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand-Am]], which began in 2000, sanctions its own endurance series, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]], which consists of slower and lower-cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars. The [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[American Le Mans Series]] announced a merger between the two series forming the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] starting in 2014.\n\nThese races are often conducted over long distances, at least {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}}, and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers, switching every few hours. Due to the performance difference between production-based sports cars and purpose-built sports prototypes, one race usually involves several racing classes, each fighting for their own championship.\n\nFamous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]], [[Spa 24 Hours|24 Hours of Spa]]-Franchorchamps, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]], and the {{convert|1000|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]]. There is also the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring|24 Hours of the N\u00fcrburgring]] on the infamous Nordschleife track and the [[Dubai 24 Hour]], which is aimed at GT3 and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro-am drivers.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sports car racing"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km"}, {"name": "3", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "3", "value": "km"}, {"name": "adj", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Production-car racing", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Production car racing}}\n\nProduction-car racing, otherwise known as \"showroom stock\" in the US, is an economical and rules-restricted version of touring-car racing, mainly used to restrict costs.

They have since spread around the world.\nTime Attack racing is a type of motorsport in which the racers compete for the best lap time. Each vehicle is timed through numerous circuits of the track. The racers make a preliminary circuit, then run the timed laps, and then finish with a cool-down lap.\nTime Attack and time trial events differ by competition format and rules. Time Attack has a limited number of laps, time trial has open sessions.\nUnlike other timed motorsport disciplines such as sprinting and hillclimbing, the car is required to start off under full rolling start conditions following a warm up lap in which they will have to accelerate out as fast as possible to determine how fast they enter their timed lap. Commonly, as the cars are modified road going cars, they are required to have tires authorized for road use.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Time attack"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Stock car racing", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Stock car racing}}\n[[File:Green flag at Daytona.JPG|thumb|NASCAR green flag start at [[Daytona International Speedway]] for the [[2015 Daytona 500]]]]\n[[File:BrettSontag2010LateModelRockfordSpeedway.jpg|thumb|An [[ASA Late Model Series]] stock car on an asphalt track]]\n\nIn North America, [[stock car racing]] is the most popular form of auto racing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer |first=Jenna |title=Addition of IndyCar champ Hornish will give Penske third Cup team|url= http://espn.go.com/racing/news/story?id=3099978&seriesId=2 |accessdate=February 8, 2009|work=ESPN News Services |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=November 8, 2007|location=Charlotte, North Carolina}}</ref> Primarily raced on [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], stock cars vaguely resemble production cars, but are in fact purpose-built racing machines that are built to tight specifications and, together with touring cars, also called [[Silhouette racing car]]s.\n\nThe largest stock car racing governing body is [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing). NASCAR's premier series is the [[Monster Energy Cup Series]], its most famous races being the [[Daytona 500]], the [[Bojangles Southern 500|Southern 500]], the [[Coca-Cola 600]], and the [[Brickyard 400]]. NASCAR also runs several feeder series, including the [[Xfinity Series]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] (a [[pickup truck]] racing series). The series conduct races across the entire [[continental United States]]. The [[NASCAR Pinty's Series]] conducts races across Canada and the [[NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series]] conducts races across Mexico.\n\nNASCAR also governs several smaller regional series, such as the [[Whelen Modified Tour]]. Modified cars are best described as open-wheel cars. Modified cars have no parts related to the stock vehicle for which they are named after. A number of modified cars display a \"manufacturer's\" logo and \"vehicle name\", yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer.\n\nThere are also other stock car governing bodies, most notably the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] (ARCA).\n\nIn the UK, [[British Stock car racing]] is also referred to as \"Short Circuit Racing\". UK Stock car racing started in the 1950s and grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s. Events take place on shale or tarmac tracks&nbsp;\u2013 usually around 1/4&nbsp;mile long. The governing bodies for the sport are the Oval Racing Council (ORC) and BriSCA. Both bodies are made up of individual stadium promoters. There are around 35 tracks in the UK and upwards of 7000 active drivers. The sport is split into three basic divisions&nbsp;\u2013 distinguished by the rules regarding car contact during racing. The most famous championship is the [[BriSCA F1 Stock Cars]]. Full-contact formulas include Bangers, Bombers and Rookie Bangers&nbsp;\u2013 and racing features Demolitions Derbies, Figure of Eight and Oval Racing.\n\nSemi Contact Formulas include BriSCA F1, F2 and Superstox&nbsp;\u2013 where bumpers are used tactically.\n\nNon-contact formulas include National Hot Rods, Stock Rods, and Lightning Rods.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stock car racing"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Fryer"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Jenna"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Addition of IndyCar champ Hornish will give Penske third Cup team"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://espn.go.com/racing/news/story?id=3099978&seriesId=2"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "February 8, 2009"}, {"name": "work", "value": "ESPN News Services"}, {"name": "agency", "value": "Associated Press"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "ESPN Internet Ventures"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 8, 2007"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": "Rallying", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Rallying}}\n[[File:Andreas Mikkelsen - WRC Portugal 2013 (8647047945).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Mikkelsen]] driving a [[Volkswagen Polo R WRC|VW Polo R WRC]] during the [[2013 Rally de Portugal]]]]\n[[File:Longford extreme slide 2.jpg|thumb|[[Holden V8 engine|Holden V8-powered]] 1980 [[Mercedes-Benz SL-Class|Mercedes]] at the 2010 [[Targa Tasmania]]]]\n\n[[Rallying]] at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] road-legal production-based cars; [[Group N]] production cars and more modified [[Group A]] cars. Cars compete on closed public roads or off-road areas on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers \"rally\" to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of \"special stages\" on any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as pace notes. During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event's special stages, including penalties.\n\nThe top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), first contested in 1973, but there are also regional championships, and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], [[Rally Argentina]], [[Rally Finland]], and [[Rally GB]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a [[rally raid]]) is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]], conceived in 1978. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]], which are popular with amateurs, making up the \"grass roots\" of motor sports. Cars at this level may not comply fully with the requirements of [[group A]] or [[group N]] [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]].\n\nOther major rally events include the [[British Rally Championship]], [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]], [[African Rally Championship]], [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship]], and endurance rally events like the [[Dakar Rally]].\n\nThe [[Targa Tasmania]], held on the Australian island state of Tasmania and run annually since 1992, takes its name from the [[Targa Florio]], a former motoring event held on the island of [[Sicily]].

Adjustments can occur in [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspensions]], brakes, [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]], engines, tires, and many others.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\nAerodynamics and airflow play big roles in the setup of a racecar. Aerodynamic downforce improves the race car's handling by lowering the center of gravity and distributing the weight of the car equally on each tire.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\">{{cite journal |journal=Popular Science |title=The Perfect Racecar |date=April 2006 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MY3SEwT-K0oC&pg=PA50&dq=The+Perfect+Racecar |last=Adams |first=Eric |first2=Joe |last2=Brown |volume=268 |issue=4 |pages=50\u201351 |accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref> Once this is achieved, fuel consumption decreases and the forces against the car are significantly lowered.

It is experimentally proven that downforce is gained and the vehicles handling is considerably changed when aerodynamic wings on the front and rear of the vehicle are installed.<ref name=\"Diba, Fereydoon 2014\"/>\n\n===Suspension===\nSuspension plays a huge part in giving the racecar the ability to be driven optimally. Shocks are mounted vertically or horizontally to prevent the body from rolling in the corners. The suspension is important because it makes the car stable and easier to control and keeps the tires on the road when driving on uneven terrain. It works in three different ways including vertically, longitudinally, and laterally to control movement when racing on various tracks.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/>\n\n===Tires===\nTires called R-Compounds are commonly used in motorsports for high amounts of traction. The soft rubber allows them to expand when they are heated up, making more surface area on the pavement, therefore producing the most traction.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/> These types of tires do not have grooves on them. Tire pressure is dependent on the temperature of the tire and track when racing. Each time a driver pulls into the pits, the tire pressure and temperature should be tested for optimal performance. When the tires get too hot they will swell or inflate and need to be deflated to the correct pressure.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/> When the tires are not warmed up they will not perform as well.\n\n===Brakes===\nBrakes on a race car are imperative in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake pedal force, and vehicle deceleration.<ref name=\"Groot, S. 2011\">de Groot, S., et al. \"Car Racing In A Simulator: Validation And Assessment Of Brake Pedal Stiffness.\" Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments 20.1 (2011): 47\u201361. Academic Search Complete. Web. 7 Dec. 2016.</ref> Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and pedal force of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure.<ref name=\"Groot, S. 2011\"/> Brake performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes and they have not warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.<ref name=\"Groot, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Engine===\nThe race car's engine needs a considerable amount of air to produce maximum power. The air intake manifold sucks the air from scoops on the hood and front bumper and feeds it into the engine.
