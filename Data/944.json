He was the second son of [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] and [[Fulk of Jerusalem]], and succeeded his older brother [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. During his reign, Jerusalem became more closely allied with the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the two states launched an unsuccessful [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|invasion of Egypt]]. Meanwhile, the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] and later [[Saladin]]. He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem, [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], and [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella I]].\n\nOlder scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers, making Amalric to be '''Amalric I''' (1163\u201374) and King [[Aimery of Jerusalem|Aimery]] (1197\u20131205) to be \"Amalric II\". Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king.

After the death of Fulk in a hunting accident in 1143, the throne passed jointly to Melisende and Amalric's older brother [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], who was still only 13 years old. Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later, and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other. In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king, and civil war broke out, with Melisende retaining [[Jerusalem]] while Baldwin held territory further north. Amalric, who had been given the [[County of Jaffa]] as an [[apanage]] when he reached the age of majority in 1151, remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem, and when Baldwin invaded the south, Amalric was besieged in the [[Tower of David]] with his mother. Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter. In 1153 Baldwin captured the [[Egypt]]ian fortress of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], which was then added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa (see [[Battle of Ascalon (1153)|Battle of Ascalon]]).\n\nAmalric married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. Agnes, daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa]], had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader [[County of Edessa]] were lost in 1150. [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Patriarch Fulcher]] objected to the marriage on grounds of [[consanguinity]], as the two shared a great-great-grandfather, [[Guy I of Montlh\u00e9ry]], and it seems that they waited until Fulcher's death to marry. Agnes bore Amalric three children: [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the future [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] (both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right), and Alix, who died in childhood.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Succession", "paragraphs": "Baldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled.[[File:Amaury Coin (1163-1174).jpg|thumb|Coin of Amaury (1163-1174): Amaury and his successors used the Holy Sepulchre on the obverse image for their deniers as a way of strengthening their relationship with the church where they were both crowned and buried.

Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married [[Hugh of Ibelin]], to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Runciman"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1952"}, {"name": "p", "value": "299"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Conflicts with the Muslim states", "paragraphs": "[[File:Maria Comnena and Amalric I of Jerusalem.jpg|frame|The marriage of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Comnena at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in 1167, as depicted in a MS of the ''Histoire d'Outremer'', painted in Paris c. 1295\u20131300.

Zengi united Aleppo, [[Mosul]], and other cities of northern Syria, and intended to impose his control on [[Damascus]] in the south. The [[Second Crusade]] in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus, which soon fell to Zengi's son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]. Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the [[Principality of Antioch]]. Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt, where the [[Fatimid dynasty]] was suffering from a series of young [[caliph]]s and civil wars. The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], who died during an expedition there.

The vizier, Dirgham, had recently overthrown the vizier [[Shawar]], and marched out to meet Amalric at [[Pelusium]], but was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Bilbeis]]. The Egyptians then opened up the [[Nile]] dams and let the river flood, hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further. Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din, who sent his general [[Shirkuh]] to settle the dispute in 1164. In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric, but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed. Shawar, however, feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself, and he too looked to Amalric for assistance. Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus.\n\nAmalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria, having taken [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] and [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] prisoner at the [[Battle of Harim]] during Amalric's absence. Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund's ransom in 1165 (Raymond remained in captivity until 1173). The year 1166 was relatively quiet, but Amalric sent envoys to the [[Byzantine Empire]] seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife, and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din, who captured [[Banias]].\n\nIn 1167, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him, establishing a camp near [[Cairo]]; Shawar again allied with Amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph [[al-Adid]] himself. Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the [[Nile]]. After an indecisive battle, Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh marched north to capture [[Alexandria]]; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there, aided by a Pisan fleet from Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite book|title=Documenti sulle Relazioni delle Citta Toscane coll'Oriente Cristiano e coi Turchi|year=1879|publisher=M.

However, Amalric could not remain there indefinitely, and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute.\n\n===Byzantine alliance===\nAfter his return to Jerusalem in 1167, Amalric married [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], a great-grandniece of [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]]. The negotiations had taken two years, mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return [[Antioch]] to Jerusalem. Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] on August 29, 1167. During this time the queen dowager, Baldwin III's widow [[Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Theodora]], eloped with her cousin [[Andronicus I Comnenus|Andronicus]] to [[Damascus]], and [[Akko|Acre]], which had been in her possession, reverted into the royal domain of Jerusalem. It was also around this time that [[William of Tyre]] was promoted to [[archdeacon]] of Tyre, and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom.\n\nIn 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt, and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to [[Constantinople]] to finalize the treaty. Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar, Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din, and Amalric invaded. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] eagerly supported this invasion, while the [[Knights Templar]] refused to have any part in it. In October, without waiting for any Byzantine assistance (and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return), Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis. The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved. Amalric then marched to Cairo, where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well, and upon his arrival Amalric retreated.\n\n===Rise of Saladin===\nIn January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated. Shirkuh became vizier, although he himself died in March, and was succeeded by his nephew [[Saladin]]. Amalric became alarmed and sent [[Frederick de la Roche]], [[Archbishop of Tyre]], to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe, but no assistance was forthcoming. Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived, and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged [[Damietta]] by sea and by land. The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp; the Byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure, and a truce was signed with Saladin. Amalric returned home.\n\nNow Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies. In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of [[Eilat]], severing Jerusalem's connection with the Red Sea. Saladin, who was set up as Vizier of Egypt, was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph. Saladin's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem, as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal. Nevertheless, in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time, but again no help was received. Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by Saladin and Nur ad-Din, but also by the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]].  In one episode, the Knights Templar murdered some Assassin envoys, leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Amalric"}, {"name": "display", "value": "Amalric s.v.
