However, the first Labour<!-- Do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context. --> leader and Prime Minister [[Chris Watson]] was a supporter of federation.\n\nHistorian Celia Hamilton, examining New South Wales, argues for the central role of Irish Catholics. Before 1890, they opposed Henry Parkes, the main Liberal leader, and of free trade, seeing them both as the ideals of Protestant Englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests. In the strike of 1890 the leading Catholic, Sydney's Archbishop [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were negative.  After 1900, says Hamilton, Irish Catholics were drawn to the Labour Party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labour gained in the more Catholic areas and the representation of Catholics increased in Labour's parliamentary ranks.<ref>Celia Hamilton, \"Irish\u2010Catholics of New South Wales and the Labor Party, 1890\u20131910.\" ''Historical Studies: Australia & New Zealand'' (1958) 8#31: 254\u2013267.</ref>\n\n=== Early decades at the federal level ===\nThe [[1901 Australian federal election|federal parliament in 1901]] was contested by each state Labour Party.

The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the \"[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment,\" which said that \"socialisation\" was desirable only when was necessary to \"eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.\"{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=53}} In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank]].\n\nThe Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |title=National Constitution of the ALP |year=2009 |work=Official Website of the Australian Labor Party |publisher=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030014535/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}</ref> The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement.

This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about \"[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]]\" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In practice the Labor party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967.

Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]]. In December 1941, Curtin announced that \"Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom\", thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Menzies Government]]).

The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank]].\n\nThe Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |title=National Constitution of the ALP |year=2009 |work=Official Website of the Australian Labor Party |publisher=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030014535/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}</ref> The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia policy]], a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=19}} Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], White Australia and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism.\n\nHistorically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the White Australia policy, which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about \"[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]]\" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In practice the Labor party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently, Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Faulkner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Macintyre"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "p", "value": "3"}]}, {"name": "Australian Dictionary of Biography ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Nairn"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Bede"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "id", "value": "A120450b"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Watson, John Christian (Chris) (1867\u20131941)"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "12"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "9 February 2010"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Charles Richardson"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/images/stories/policy-magazine/2009-autumn/25-1-09-charles-richardson.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Fusion: The Party System We Had To Have?"}, {"name": "date", "value": "25 January 2009"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "19 September 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "year", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "first", "value": "D.

In December 1941, Curtin announced that \"Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom\", thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Menzies Government]]).

It maintains that \"Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely.\" While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: \"Labor believes in a strong role for national government \u2013 the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote.\" Labor \"will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions.\" The platform and Labor \"believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential.\" For Labor, \"government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status.\" Further sections of the platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.\n\nIn practice, the platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the platform, Labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Australian Labor Party"}, {"name": "title", "value": "ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "23 August 2006"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20060820193739/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "20 August 2006"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": " Party structure ", "paragraphs": "{{labour|sp=uk|expanded=parties}}\n{{labour politics in Australia}}\n\n=== National Executive and Secretariat ===\nThe [[Australian Labor Party National Executive]] is the chief administrative authority of the Australian Labor Party, subject only to Labor's [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|National Conference]].

The deputy prime minister also acts as prime minister when the prime minister is on leave or out of the country. Members of the Ministry are also chosen by Caucus, though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers.\n\n=== State and territory branches ===\n{{main|List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party}}\nThe Australian Labor Party is a federal party, consisting of eight branches from each state and territory. While the National Executive is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal, state and local elections. State and territory branches consist of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office.\n\nMembers join a state branch and pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income.  The majority of [[Australian labour movement|trade unions in Australia]] are affiliated to the party at a state level. Union affiliation is direct and not through the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Another source of funds for the party are [[political funding in Australia|political donations]] and [[Elections in Australia#Public funding|public funding]].\n\nMembers are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns.\n\nThe members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). However, [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor]] directly elects its president. The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.\n\nIn some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates. In others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two.\n\n=== Country Labor ===\n'''Country Labor''' is a subsection of the ALP, and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas.

The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (National Right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] (National Left). Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The Socialist Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more liberal on social issues. The national factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based such as Centre Unity in New South Wales and Labor Forum in Queensland.\n\nSome trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party and are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right faction are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW) and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU).<ref name=\"afr.com\">{{cite web |last1=Marin-Guzman |first1=David |title=Inside the union factions that rule the ALP conference |url=https://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/inside-the-union-factions-that-rule-the-alp-conference-20181216-h19692 |website=Australian Financial Review |accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Voice]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMMEU) and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] (CPSU).<ref name=\"afr.com\"/>\n\n[[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "unreferenced section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2013"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Marin-Guzman"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "David"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Inside the union factions that rule the ALP conference"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/inside-the-union-factions-that-rule-the-alp-conference-20181216-h19692"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Australian Financial Review"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "6 August 2019"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": " Federal parliamentary leaders ", "paragraphs": "{{main|Leaders of the Australian Labor Party}}\n[[Anthony Albanese]] is the leader of the federal Labor party, serving since 30 May 2019.
