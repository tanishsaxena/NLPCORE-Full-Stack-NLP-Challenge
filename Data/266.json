After ''Pimp to Eat'', the Analog Brothers continued performing together in various line ups. [[Kool Keith]] and Marc Live joined with Jacky Jasper to release two albums as KHM. Marc Live rapped with Ice T's group SMG. Marc also formed a group with Black Silver called Live Black, but while five of their tracks were released on a demo CD sold at concerts, Live Black's first album has yet to be released.\n\nIn 2008, [[Ice-T]] and Black Silver toured together as Black Ice, and released an album together called ''Urban Legends''.\n\nIn 2013 Black Silver and newest member to Analog Brothers, Kiew Kurzweil (Kiew Nikon of Kinetic) collaborated on the joint album called ''Slang Banging (Return to Analog)'' with production by Junkadelic Music. In addition to all this, the Analog Brothers continue to make frequent appearances on each other's solo albums.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2017"}]}, {"name": "no footnotes", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2017"}]}, {"name": "Infobox musical artist\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Analog Brothers"}, {"name": "background", "value": "group_or_band"}, {"name": "image", "value": "AnalogBrothersPromoPhoto.jpg"}, {"name": "genre", "value": "[[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]"}, {"name": "years_active", "value": "2000, 2014, 2016"}, {"name": "label", "value": "{{hlist|Ground Control Records|Junkadelic Music|[[Mello Music Group]]}}"}, {"name": "associated_acts", "value": "{{hlist|[[Kool Keith]]|[[Ice-T]]|Black Ice|[[Jacky Jasper]]|KHM|Odd Oberheim}}"}, {"name": "current_members", "value": "* Black Silver\n* [[Ice-T]]\n* [[Kool Keith]]\n* Marc Live\n* Pimp Rex\n* Kiew Nikon"}]}, {"name": "hlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ground Control Records"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Junkadelic Music"}, {"name": "3", "value": "[[Mello Music Group]]"}]}, {"name": "hlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Kool Keith]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[Ice-T]]"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Black Ice"}, {"name": "4", "value": "[[Jacky Jasper]]"}, {"name": "5", "value": "KHM"}, {"name": "6", "value": "Odd Oberheim"}]}, {"name": "Cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.mtv.com/news/1123017/ice-t-kool-keith-unleash-analog-brothers-album/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ice-T, Kool Keith Unleash Analog Brothers Album"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[MTV News]]"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2017-11-13"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Discography", "paragraphs": "* 2000 ''- 2005 A.D.''
