In statistics, the term [[average]] refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set consisting of the values <math>a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n</math>, then the arithmetic mean <math>A</math> is defined by the formula:\n\n:<math>A=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}</math>\n\n(See [[summation]] for an explanation of the [[summation operator]]).\n\nFor example, consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400. The arithmetic mean is\n\n: <math>\\frac{ 2500+ 2700+ 2400+ 2300+ 2550+ 2650+ 2750+ 2450+ 2600+ 2400}{10}=2530.</math>\n\nIf the data set is a [[statistical population]] (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the '''population mean'''. If the data set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]] (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a '''sample mean'''.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Medhi"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Jyotiprasad"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1992"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "New Age International"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9788122404197"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "53\u201358"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Motivating properties", "paragraphs": "\nThe arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency.

Since <math>x_i-\\bar{x}</math> is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.\n* If it is required to use a single number as a \"typical\" value for a set of known numbers <math>x_1,\\dotsc,x_n</math>, then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of <math>(x_i-\\bar{x})^2</math>. (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)<ref name=\"JM\"/> If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is [[unbiased estimate|unbiased]] is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "Contrast with median", "paragraphs": "{{main|Median}}\nThe arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the [[median]]. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the data [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample <math>{1,2,3,4}</math>. The average is <math>2.5</math>, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as <math>{1,2,4,8,16}</math>, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.\n\nThere are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Krugman |url=http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-inequality-debate |title=The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate |work=The American Prospect |date=June 4, 2014 |orig-year=Fall 1992}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Median"}]}, {"name": "cite magazine ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Paul"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Krugman"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-inequality-debate"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The American Prospect"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 4, 2014"}, {"name": "orig-year", "value": "Fall 1992"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Generalizations", "paragraphs": "\n===Weighted average===\n{{main|Weighted average}}\nA weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation.

Na\u00efvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 yields a result of 180\u00b0.\nThis is incorrect for two reasons:\n* Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of [[degree (angle)|360\u00b0]] (or 2\u03c0, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1\u00b0 and \u22121\u00b0, or 361\u00b0 and 719\u00b0, each of which gives a different average.\n* Secondly, in this situation, 0\u00b0 (equivalently, 360\u00b0) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1\u00b0 from it, and 179\u00b0 from 180\u00b0, the putative average).\n\nIn general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ([[viz.]], define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 is 2\u00b0, not 358\u00b0).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Mean of circular quantities"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": " Symbols and encoding ", "paragraphs": "The arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar, for example as in <math>\\bar{x}</math> (read <math>x</math> ''bar'').<ref name=\"JM\"/>\n\nSome software ([[Text processing|text processors]], [[web browser]]s) may not display the x\u0304 symbol properly.
