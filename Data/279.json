Ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts, such as [[Mammon]] (money and material things), [[Nabu]] (rationality), or [[Baal|Ba'al]] (violent weather); Bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage\u2014with their lives and their children's lives\u2014to these old gods of wealth, physical appetites, and self-deification.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Agnosticism|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1929|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=12\u201319}}</ref> Thus, if one attempted to be agnostic passively, he or she would incidentally join the worship of the world's gods.\n\nIn ''Unfashionable Convictions (1931),'' he criticized the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s complete faith in human [[Sense|sensory perception]], augmented by scientific instruments, as a means of accurately grasping Reality. Firstly, it was fairly new, an innovation of the Western World, which [[Aristotle]] invented and [[Thomas Aquinas]] revived among the scientific community. Secondly, the divorce of \"pure\" science from human experience, as manifested in American [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]], had completely altered the environment, often disfiguring it, so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs. Thirdly, because scientists were constantly producing more data\u2014to the point where no single human could grasp it all at once\u2014it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe; therefore, to admit the mysteries of the unobserved universe was to be ''actually'' scientific.\n\nBell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with the world. ''Artistic experience'' was how one expressed meaning through speaking, writing, painting, gesturing\u2014any sort of communication which shared insight into a human's inner reality. ''Mystical experience'' was how one could \"read\" people and harmonize with them, being what we commonly call love.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> In summary, man was a scientist, artist, and lover. Without exercising all three, a person became \"lopsided.\"\n\nBell considered a [[Humanism|humanist]] to be a person who cannot rightly ignore the other ways of knowing. However, humanism, like agnosticism, was also temporal, and would eventually lead to either scientific [[materialism]] or [[theism]]. He lays out the following thesis:\n\n# Truth cannot be discovered by reasoning on the evidence of scientific data alone. Modern peoples' dissatisfaction with life is the result of depending on such incomplete data. Our ability to reason is not a way to discover Truth but rather a way to organize our knowledge and experiences somewhat sensibly. Without a full, human perception of the world, one's reason tends to lead them in the wrong direction.\n# Beyond what can be measured with scientific tools, there are other types of perception, such as one's ability know another human through loving. One's loves cannot be dissected and logged in a scientific journal, but we know them far better than we know the surface of the sun. They show us an undefinable reality that is nevertheless intimate and personal, and they reveal qualities lovelier and truer than detached facts can provide.\n# To be religious, in the Christian sense, is to live for the Whole of Reality (God) rather than for a small part (gods). Only by treating this Whole of Reality as a person\u2014good and true and perfect\u2014rather than an impersonal force, can we come closer to the Truth. An ultimate Person can be loved, but a cosmic force cannot. A scientist can only discover peripheral truths, but a lover is able to get at the Truth.\n# There are many reasons to believe in God but they are not sufficient for an agnostic to become a theist. It is not enough to believe in an ancient holy book, even though when it is accurately analyzed without bias, it proves to be more trustworthy and admirable than what we are taught in school. Neither is it enough to realize how probable it is that a personal God would have to show human beings how to live, considering they have so much trouble on their own. Nor is it enough to believe for the reason that, throughout history, millions of people have arrived at this Wholeness of Reality only through religious experience. The aforementioned reasons may warm one toward religion, but they fall short of convincing. However, if one presupposes that God is in fact a knowable, loving person, as an experiment, and then lives according that religion, he or she will suddenly come face to face with experiences previously unknown. One's life becomes full, meaningful, and fearless in the face of death. It does not defy reason but ''exceeds'' it.\n# Because God has been experienced through love, the orders of prayer, fellowship, and devotion now matter. They create order within one's life, continually renewing the \"missing piece\" that had previously felt lost. They empower one to be compassionate and humble, not small-minded or arrogant.\n# No truth should be denied outright, but all should be questioned. Science reveals an ever-growing vision of our universe that should not be discounted due to bias toward older understandings. Reason is to be trusted and cultivated. To believe in God is not to forego reason or to deny scientific facts, but to step into the unknown and discover the fullness of life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers Publishing|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=25\u201328}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sanjaya Belatthaputta"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "World scriptures: an introduction to comparative religions"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Kramer"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Kenneth"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-8091-2781-8"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1986"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&pg=PA34"}, {"name": "page", "value": "34"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Subodh Varma"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spirituality/vintage-wisdom/The-gods-came-afterwards/articleshow/6014217.cms?referral=PM"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The gods came afterwards"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The Times of India]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "May 6, 2011"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "June 9, 2011"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151105235331/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spirituality/vintage-wisdom/The-gods-came-afterwards/articleshow/6014217.cms?referral=PM"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "November 5, 2015"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "df", "value": "mdy"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Kenneth Kramer"}, {"name": "title", "value": "World Scriptures: An Introduction to Comparative Religions"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&pg=PA34"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 1986"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Paulist Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-8091-2781-8"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "34\u2013"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Christian"}, {"name": "first", "value": "David"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=7RdVmDjwTtQC&pg=PA18"}, {"name": "date", "value": "September 1, 2011"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of California Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-520-95067-2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "18\u2013"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Upinder Singh"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&pg=PA206"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Pearson Education India"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-81-317-1120-0"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "206\u2013"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "<poem> But, after all, who knows, and who can say\n Whence it all came, and how creation happened?\n The gods themselves are later than creation, \n so who knows truly whence it has arisen?\n\n Whence all creation had its origin,\n He, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,\n He, who surveys it all from highest heaven,\n He knows -

Ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts, such as [[Mammon]] (money and material things), [[Nabu]] (rationality), or [[Baal|Ba'al]] (violent weather); Bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage\u2014with their lives and their children's lives\u2014to these old gods of wealth, physical appetites, and self-deification.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Agnosticism|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1929|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=12\u201319}}</ref> Thus, if one attempted to be agnostic passively, he or she would incidentally join the worship of the world's gods.\n\nIn ''Unfashionable Convictions (1931),'' he criticized the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s complete faith in human [[Sense|sensory perception]], augmented by scientific instruments, as a means of accurately grasping Reality. Firstly, it was fairly new, an innovation of the Western World, which [[Aristotle]] invented and [[Thomas Aquinas]] revived among the scientific community. Secondly, the divorce of \"pure\" science from human experience, as manifested in American [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]], had completely altered the environment, often disfiguring it, so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs. Thirdly, because scientists were constantly producing more data\u2014to the point where no single human could grasp it all at once\u2014it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe; therefore, to admit the mysteries of the unobserved universe was to be ''actually'' scientific.\n\nBell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with the world. ''Artistic experience'' was how one expressed meaning through speaking, writing, painting, gesturing\u2014any sort of communication which shared insight into a human's inner reality. ''Mystical experience'' was how one could \"read\" people and harmonize with them, being what we commonly call love.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> In summary, man was a scientist, artist, and lover. Without exercising all three, a person became \"lopsided.\"\n\nBell considered a [[Humanism|humanist]] to be a person who cannot rightly ignore the other ways of knowing. However, humanism, like agnosticism, was also temporal, and would eventually lead to either scientific [[materialism]] or [[theism]]. He lays out the following thesis:\n\n# Truth cannot be discovered by reasoning on the evidence of scientific data alone. Modern peoples' dissatisfaction with life is the result of depending on such incomplete data. Our ability to reason is not a way to discover Truth but rather a way to organize our knowledge and experiences somewhat sensibly. Without a full, human perception of the world, one's reason tends to lead them in the wrong direction.\n# Beyond what can be measured with scientific tools, there are other types of perception, such as one's ability know another human through loving. One's loves cannot be dissected and logged in a scientific journal, but we know them far better than we know the surface of the sun. They show us an undefinable reality that is nevertheless intimate and personal, and they reveal qualities lovelier and truer than detached facts can provide.\n# To be religious, in the Christian sense, is to live for the Whole of Reality (God) rather than for a small part (gods). Only by treating this Whole of Reality as a person\u2014good and true and perfect\u2014rather than an impersonal force, can we come closer to the Truth. An ultimate Person can be loved, but a cosmic force cannot. A scientist can only discover peripheral truths, but a lover is able to get at the Truth.\n# There are many reasons to believe in God but they are not sufficient for an agnostic to become a theist. It is not enough to believe in an ancient holy book, even though when it is accurately analyzed without bias, it proves to be more trustworthy and admirable than what we are taught in school. Neither is it enough to realize how probable it is that a personal God would have to show human beings how to live, considering they have so much trouble on their own. Nor is it enough to believe for the reason that, throughout history, millions of people have arrived at this Wholeness of Reality only through religious experience. The aforementioned reasons may warm one toward religion, but they fall short of convincing. However, if one presupposes that God is in fact a knowable, loving person, as an experiment, and then lives according that religion, he or she will suddenly come face to face with experiences previously unknown. One's life becomes full, meaningful, and fearless in the face of death. It does not defy reason but ''exceeds'' it.\n# Because God has been experienced through love, the orders of prayer, fellowship, and devotion now matter. They create order within one's life, continually renewing the \"missing piece\" that had previously felt lost. They empower one to be compassionate and humble, not small-minded or arrogant.\n# No truth should be denied outright, but all should be questioned. Science reveals an ever-growing vision of our universe that should not be discounted due to bias toward older understandings. Reason is to be trusted and cultivated. To believe in God is not to forego reason or to deny scientific facts, but to step into the unknown and discover the fullness of life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers Publishing|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=25\u201328}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Brandt"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Eric T., and Timothy Larsen"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Old Atheism Revisited: Robert G.
