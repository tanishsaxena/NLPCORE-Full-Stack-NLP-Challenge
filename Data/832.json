His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said \"O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me\". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol, saying, \"O God, give me some delicious food. See that I am so hungry\". The idol remained cold.

Taken unaware, the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic. There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in an attempt to seek cover. Muhammad, however, stood firm. Only nine companions remained around him, including Abu Bakr. Under Muhammad's instruction, [[Abbas ibn Abdul Muttalib|Abbas]] shouted at the top of his voice, \"O Muslims, come to the Prophet of Allah\". The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad. When the Muslims had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy. In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to [[Autas]].\n\nMuhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas. In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught. Believing continued resistance useless, the tribes broke camp and retired to Ta'if.\n\nAbu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the [[Siege of Ta'if|attack against Ta'if]]. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open. The Muslims employed catapults, but without tangible result. The Muslims attempted to use a testudo formation, in which a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate. However, the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo, rendering it ineffective.\n\nThe siege dragged on for two weeks, and still there was no sign of weakness in the fort. Muhammad held a council of war. Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God make arrangements for the fall of the fort. The advice was accepted, and in February 630, the siege of Ta'if was raised and the Muslim army returned to [[Mecca]]. A few days later Malik bin Auf, the commander, came to [[Mecca]] and became a Muslim.<ref>{{cite book | title=Sidiq-i-Akbar Hazrat Abu Bakr | author=Masud-ul-Hasan | page=46 | publisher=A. Salam, Ferozsons Ltd | location=Lahore}}</ref>\n\n===Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj===\nIn 631 AD, Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the [[Hajj]] according to the new Islamic way and appointed Abu Bakr as the leader of the delegation. The day after Abu Bakr and his party had left for the Hajj, Muhammad received a new revelation: Surah Tawbah, the ninth chapter of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Sayed Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims |page=255}}</ref> It is related that when this revelation came, someone suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr. Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=ibn Ishaq |first1=Muhammad |title=The Life of the Messenger of God}}</ref>\n\nMuhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim a portion of Surah Tawbah to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]]. Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.\n\nAt Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were:\n\n#Henceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the [[Kaaba]] or perform the pilgrimage.\n#No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked.\n#[[Polytheism]] was not to be tolerated. Where the Muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods. Where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists.\n\nFrom the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned, and Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia.\n\n===Military campaigns as commander===\n{{Main|Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=March 2019}}\nAbu Bakr also led one military campaign as commander, known as the [[Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq]],<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZmBkoDa9fcC&pg=PA205 |title=Atlas Al-s\u012brah Al-Nabaw\u012byah |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Darussalam |via=Google Books}}</ref> which took place in [[Najd|Nejd]], in July 628 (3rd Month 7AH in the [[Islamic calendar]]).<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> Abu Bakr led a large platoon in Nejd on the order of Muhammad.

In the last months of his rule, he sent Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests [[Muslim conquest of Persia|against the Sassanid Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|against the Byzantine Empire]] in Syria. This would set in motion a historical trajectory<ref name=\"Donner\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBzRj7OajmEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Fred M.

He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, he agreed to draw a salary from the state treasury and discontinue his cloth trade.\n\n===Ridda wars===\n[[File:Caliph Abu Bakr's empire at its peak 634-mohammad adil rais.PNG|thumb|300px|Caliph Abu Bakr's empire at its peak in August 634.]]\n{{main|Ridda wars}}\nTroubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, with several Arab tribes launching revolts, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. These insurgencies and the caliphate's responses to them are collectively referred to  as the [[Ridda wars]] (\"Wars of Apostasy\").<ref name=DonnerP85>{{cite book |last=Donner |first=Fred M. |authorlink=Fred Donner |title=The Early Islamic Conquests |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1981 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l5__AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe opposition movements came in two forms. One type challenged the political power of the nascent caliphate as well as the religious authority of Islam with the acclamation of rival ideologies, headed by political leaders who claimed the mantle of prophethood in the manner that Muhammad had done. These rebellions include:<ref name=DonnerP85/>\n*that of the [[Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah]] headed by [[Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asadi|Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid]]\n*that of the [[Banu Hanifa]] headed by [[Musaylimah]]\n*those from among the [[Banu Taghlib]] and the [[Bani Tamim]] headed by [[Sajah]]\n*that of the [[Al-Ansi]] headed by [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi]]\nThese leaders are all denounced in Islamic histories as \"false prophets\".<ref name=DonnerP85/>\n\nThe second form of opposition movement was more strictly political in character. Some of the revolts of this type took the form of tax rebellions in [[Najd]] among tribes such as the [[Banu Fazara]] and [[Banu Tamim]]. Other dissenters, while initially allied to the Muslims, used Muhammad's death as an opportunity to attempt to restrict the growth of the new Islamic state. They include some of the [[Rab\u012b\u02bfa]] in [[Bahrayn]], the [[Azd]] in [[Oman proper|Oman]], as well as among the [[Kindah]] and Khawlan in [[Greater Yemen|Yemen]].<ref name=DonnerP85/>\n\nAbu Bakr, likely understanding that maintaining firm control over the disparate tribes of Arabia was crucial to ensuring the survival of the state, suppressed the insurrections with military force. He dispatched [[Khalid ibn Walid]] and a body of troops to subdue the uprisings in Najd as well as that of Musaylimah, who posed the most serious threat. Concurrent to this, [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]] and [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]] were sent to Bahrayn, while [[Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl]], [[Hudhayfah al-Bariqi]] and [[Arfaja al-Bariqi]] were instructed to conquer Oman. Finally, [[Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya]] and [[Khalid ibn Asid]] were sent to Yemen to aid the local governor in re-establishing control. Abu Bakr also made use of diplomatic means in addition to military measures. Like Muhammad before him, he utilised marriage alliances and financial incentives to bind former enemies to the caliphate. For instance, a member of the Banu Hanifa who had sided with the Muslims was rewarded with the granting of a land estate. Similarly, a Kindah rebel named [[Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays]], after repenting and re-joining Islam, was later given land in Medina as well as the hand of Abu Bakr's sister Umm Farwa in marriage.<ref>{{harvtxt|Donner|1981|pages=86\u201387}}</ref>\n\nAt their heart, the Ridda movements were challenges to the political and religious supremacy of the Islamic state. Through his success in suppressing the insurrections, Abu Bakr had in effect continued the political consolidation which had begun under Muhammad's leadership with relatively little interruption. By wars' end, he had established an Islamic hegemony over the entirety of the [[Arabian peninsula]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Donner|1981|page=86}}</ref>\n\n===Expeditions into Persia and Syria===\nWith Arabia having united under a single centralised state with a formidable military, the region could now be viewed as a potential threat to the neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian empire]]s. It may be that Abu Bakr, reasoning that it was inevitable that one of these powers would launch a pre-emptive strike against the youthful caliphate, decided that it was better to deliver the first blow himself. Regardless of the caliph's motivations, in 633, small forces were dispatched into [[Iraq]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], capturing several towns. Though the Byzantines and Sassanians were certain to retaliate, Abu Bakr had reason to be confident. The two empires were militarily exhausted after centuries of war against each other, making it likely that any forces sent to Arabia would be diminished and weakened.<ref name=NardoP32>{{cite book |last=Nardo |first=Don |authorlink=Don Nardo |title=The Islamic Empire |publisher=Lucent Books |year=2011 |pages=30, 32 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yIhmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n  \nA more pressing advantage though was the effectiveness of the Muslim fighters as well as their zeal, the latter of which was partially based on their certainty of the righteousness of their cause. Additionally, the general belief among the Muslims was that the community must be defended at all costs. Historian [[Theodor N\u00f6ldeke]] gives the somewhat controversial opinion that this religious fervour was intentionally used to maintain the enthusiasm and momentum of the ''[[ummah]]'':<ref name=NardoP32/>\n\n{{Quote|It was certainly good policy to turn the recently subdued tribes of the wilderness towards an external aim in which they might at once satisfy their lust for booty on a grand scale, maintain their warlike feeling, and strengthen themselves in their attachment to the new faith\u2026 Muhammad himself had already sent expeditions across the [Byzantine] frontier, and thereby had pointed out the way to his successors. To follow in his footsteps was in accordance with the innermost being of the youthful Islam, already grown great amid the tumult of arms.<ref>{{cite book |last=N\u00f6ldeke |first=Theodore |authorlink=Theodor N\u00f6ldeke |title=Sketches from Eastern History |url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.21089 |year=1892 |page=73 |ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nThough Abu Bakr had started these initial conflicts which eventually resulted in the Islamic [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquests of Persia]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|the Levant]], he did not live to see any real fighting, instead leaving the task to his successors.<ref name=NardoP32/>\n\n===Preservation of the Quran===\n{{Main|History of the Quran}}\nAbu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the [[Quran]] in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the [[Battle of Yamama]] in 632, [[Umar]] saw that some five hundred of the Muslims who had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorised the Quran]] had been killed. Fearing that it may become lost or corrupted, Umar requested that Abu Bakr authorise the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. The caliph was initially hesitant, being quoted as saying  \"how can we do that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless and keep him, did not himself do?\" He eventually relented however, and appointed [[Zayd ibn Thabit]], who had previously served as Muhammad's secretary, for the task of gathering the scattered verses. The fragments were recovered from every quarter, including from the ribs of palm branches, scraps of leather, stone tablets and \"from the hearts of men\". The collected work was transcribed onto sheets and verified through comparison with Quran memorisers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fernhout |first1=Rein |last2=Jansen |first2=Henry |last3=Jansen-Hofland |first3=Lucy |title=Canonical Texts.

These rebellions include:<ref name=DonnerP85/>\n*that of the [[Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah]] headed by [[Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asadi|Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid]]\n*that of the [[Banu Hanifa]] headed by [[Musaylimah]]\n*those from among the [[Banu Taghlib]] and the [[Bani Tamim]] headed by [[Sajah]]\n*that of the [[Al-Ansi]] headed by [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi]]\nThese leaders are all denounced in Islamic histories as \"false prophets\".<ref name=DonnerP85/>\n\nThe second form of opposition movement was more strictly political in character. Some of the revolts of this type took the form of tax rebellions in [[Najd]] among tribes such as the [[Banu Fazara]] and [[Banu Tamim]]. Other dissenters, while initially allied to the Muslims, used Muhammad's death as an opportunity to attempt to restrict the growth of the new Islamic state. They include some of the [[Rab\u012b\u02bfa]] in [[Bahrayn]], the [[Azd]] in [[Oman proper|Oman]], as well as among the [[Kindah]] and Khawlan in [[Greater Yemen|Yemen]].<ref name=DonnerP85/>\n\nAbu Bakr, likely understanding that maintaining firm control over the disparate tribes of Arabia was crucial to ensuring the survival of the state, suppressed the insurrections with military force. He dispatched [[Khalid ibn Walid]] and a body of troops to subdue the uprisings in Najd as well as that of Musaylimah, who posed the most serious threat. Concurrent to this, [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]] and [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]] were sent to Bahrayn, while [[Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl]], [[Hudhayfah al-Bariqi]] and [[Arfaja al-Bariqi]] were instructed to conquer Oman. Finally, [[Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya]] and [[Khalid ibn Asid]] were sent to Yemen to aid the local governor in re-establishing control. Abu Bakr also made use of diplomatic means in addition to military measures. Like Muhammad before him, he utilised marriage alliances and financial incentives to bind former enemies to the caliphate. For instance, a member of the Banu Hanifa who had sided with the Muslims was rewarded with the granting of a land estate. Similarly, a Kindah rebel named [[Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays]], after repenting and re-joining Islam, was later given land in Medina as well as the hand of Abu Bakr's sister Umm Farwa in marriage.<ref>{{harvtxt|Donner|1981|pages=86\u201387}}</ref>\n\nAt their heart, the Ridda movements were challenges to the political and religious supremacy of the Islamic state. Through his success in suppressing the insurrections, Abu Bakr had in effect continued the political consolidation which had begun under Muhammad's leadership with relatively little interruption. By wars' end, he had established an Islamic hegemony over the entirety of the [[Arabian peninsula]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Donner|1981|page=86}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ridda wars"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Donner"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Fred M."}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Fred Donner"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Early Islamic Conquests"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Princeton University Press"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "page", "value": "85"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l5__AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "harv"}]}, {"name": "harvtxt", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Donner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "86\u201387"}]}, {"name": "harvtxt", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Donner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1981"}, {"name": "page", "value": "86"}]}], "id": 22}, {"title": "Expeditions into Persia and Syria", "paragraphs": "With Arabia having united under a single centralised state with a formidable military, the region could now be viewed as a potential threat to the neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian empire]]s.

Fearing that it may become lost or corrupted, Umar requested that Abu Bakr authorise the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. The caliph was initially hesitant, being quoted as saying  \"how can we do that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless and keep him, did not himself do?\" He eventually relented however, and appointed [[Zayd ibn Thabit]], who had previously served as Muhammad's secretary, for the task of gathering the scattered verses.

Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life, being beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr's wisdom that Muhammad always honored.

He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/fatima-the-gracious-abu-muhammad-ordoni/abu-bakr-versus-fatima-az-zahra-sa al-islam.org], ''Fatima the Gracious'', by Abu \u2013 Muhammad Ordoni, 1987.  Section entitled ''Abu Bakr Versus Fatima az-Zahra (sa)''.<br>See also ''Sahih Al Bukhari'' Volume 5, Book 57, Number 60, which says: \"Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Allah's Apostle said, 'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.' By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah's Apostle used to do,\" Then 'Ali said, \"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,\" and added, \"O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.\" Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah's Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, \"By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah's Apostle rather than to my own relatives\" Abu Bakr added: Look at Muhammad through his family.\"\n<br>See also ''Sahih Al Bukhari'' Volume 8, Book 80, Number 722, which says:  \"Aisha said, 'When Allah's Apostle died, his wives intended to send 'Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance.' Then \"Aisha said to them, 'Didn't Allah's Apostle say, Our (Apostles') property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'\"</ref> However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book ''A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims'', Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims |pages=34\u201335}}</ref> In addition, Shias claim that Muhammad had given Fadak to Fatimah during his lifetime,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jal\u0101l\u012b |first1=\u1e24usayn\u012b |title=Fadak wa l-\u02bfaw\u0101l\u012b |page=141}}</ref> and Fadak was therefore a gift to Fatimah, not inheritance. This view has also been supported some Sunnis, such as the Abbasid ruler [[Al-Ma'mun]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shah\u012bd\u012b |title=Zindig\u0101n\u012b-yi F\u0101tima-yi Zahr\u0101 |page=117}}</ref>\n\nThe Twelver Shia accuse him of participating in [[Umar at Fatimah's house|the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima]].<ref>Ibn Qutayba al Dinawari.

The Twelver Shia strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the ''Qur'an'', claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali.<ref>[http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter8/4.html al-islam.org], ''The Quran Compiled by Imam Ali (AS)''</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Abu Bakr, Ali raised [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]].
