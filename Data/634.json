Having already accumulated enough credits to graduate, Kay then attended [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in [[Bethany, West Virginia]]. He majored in [[biology]] and minored in [[mathematics]] before he was asked to leave by the administration for protesting the institution's [[Jewish quota]].\n\nThereafter, Kay taught guitar in [[Denver, Colorado]] for a year and hastily enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] when the local draft board inquired about his nonstudent status. Assigned as a [[computer programmer]] (a rare billet dominated by women due to the secretarial connotations of the field in the era) after passing an aptitude test, he devised an early cross-platform file transfer system.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Kay enrolled at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics and [[molecular biology]] in 1966. Before and during this time, he worked as a professional [[jazz]] guitarist. During his studies at CU, he wrote the music for an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and other campus theatricals.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the autumn of 1966, he began graduate school at the [[University of Utah]] [[University of Utah College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]. He earned an [[M.S.]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1968 before taking his [[Ph.D.]] in computer science in 1969. His doctoral dissertation, ''FLEX: A Flexible Extendable Language'', described the invention of a [[computer language]] known as [[Flex (language)|FLEX]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan C.

Evans]] (who had been recently recruited from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to start Utah's computer science department) and [[Ivan Sutherland]] (best known for writing such pioneering programs as [[Sketchpad]]). Their mentorship greatly inspired Kay's evolving views on objects and programming. As he grew busier with [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] research, he ended his musical career.\n\nIn 1968, he met [[Seymour Papert]] and learned of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] [[programming language]], a [[Programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] optimized for [[education]]al purposes. This led him to learn of the work of [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], and of [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionist learning]], further influencing his professional orientation.\n\nLeaving Utah as an [[associate professor]] of computer science in 1969, Kay became a visiting researcher at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] in anticipation of accepting a professorship at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Instead, in 1970, he joined the [[Xerox]] [[PARC (company)|PARC]] research staff in [[Palo Alto, California]]. Throughout the decade, he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language [[Smalltalk]]. These inventions were later commercialized by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in their [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]] computers.\n\nKay is one of the fathers of the idea of [[object-oriented programming]], which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC. Some of the original object-oriented concepts, including the use of the words 'object' and 'class', had been developed for Simula 67 at the [[Norwegian Computing Center]]. Later he said:\n\n<blockquote>I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term \"objects\" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the  lesser idea. The big idea is \"messaging\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html|title= AlanKayOnMessaging}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile at PARC, Kay conceived the [[Dynabook]] concept, a key progenitor of [[laptop]] and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers and the [[e-book]]. He is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bergin, Jr. |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Gibson, Jr. |first2=Richard G. |place=New York, NY |year=1996 |publisher=ACM Press, Addison-Wesley |title=History of Programming Languages II |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=234286}}</ref> Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform, Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into [[mobile learning]]; many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the [[One Laptop Per Child]] educational platform, with which Kay is actively involved.\n\nThe field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to Kay, in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]], but a medium in the [[Marshall McLuhan]] sense. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As with Simulas leading to OOP, this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be. Not a personal dynamic vehicle, as in Engelbart's metaphor opposed to the IBM \"railroads\", but something much more profound: a personal dynamic medium. With a vehicle one could wait until high school and give \"drivers ed\", but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html|title=The Early History of Smalltalk|website=gagne.homedns.org|access-date=2016-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710144930/http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html|archive-date=2008-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "I had the misfortune or the fortune to learn how to read fluently starting about the age of three, so I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit first grade, and I already knew the teachers were lying to me.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/20673320 |title=Interview with Alan Kay on education |work=The Generational Divide |publisher=The Davis Group |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://vimeo.com/20673320"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Interview with Alan Kay on education"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The Generational Divide"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "The Davis Group"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "5 March 2011"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Alan C.

He became an Apple Fellow in 1984. Following the closure of the company's [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]] in 1997,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/8-people/438-alan-kay.html?start=1 |title=Alan Kay |date=13 November 2009 |work=I Programmer}}</ref> he was recruited by his friend [[Bran Ferren]], head of research and development at [[Disney]], to join [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] as a Disney Fellow. He remained there until Ferren left to start Applied Minds Inc with Imagineer [[Danny Hillis]], leading to the cessation of the Fellows program. In 2001, he founded [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.  For its first ten years, Kay and his Viewpoints group were based at [[Applied Minds]] in [[Glendale, California]], where he and Ferren continued to work together on various projects. Kay was also a Senior Fellow at [[Hewlett-Packard]] until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005.\n\nKay taught a Fall 2011 class, \"Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World\", at [[New York University]]'s [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member Nancy Hechinger. The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kay |first=Alan |title=Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World |url=https://itp.nyu.edu/registration/CourseInfo.php?course_id=489 |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet ===\nIn December 1995, while still at Apple, Kay collaborated with many others to start the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Squeak]] version of [[Smalltalk]], and he continues {{When|date=December 2018}} to work on it. As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] system. More recently he started, along with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David A. Smith]], [[David P. Reed]], [[Andreas Raab]], Rick McGeer, [[Julian Lombardi]] and [[Mark McCahill]], the [[Croquet Project]], an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.\n\n=== Tweak ===\nIn 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. [[Andreas Raab]] was a researcher working in Kay's group, then at Hewlett-Packard. He proposed defining a \"script process\" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012532/http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/|archivedate=2 October 2011|title=Events, Scripts & Multiple Processes |author=[[Andreas Raab]] |date=6 July 2001 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. [[Tweak programming environment|Tweak]] added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012629/http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/|archivedate=2 October 2011|title= Tweak: Whitepapers}}</ref> Its underlying object system is [[Class (computer programming)|class-based]], but to users (during programming) it acts like it is [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.\n\n=== Children's Machine ===\nIn November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world. It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the [[One Laptop per Child]] program, the Children's Machine, and the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]]. The program was begun and is sustained by Kay's friend [[Nicholas Negroponte]], and is based on Kay's [[Dynabook]] ideal. Kay is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.\n\n=== Reinventing programming ===\nKay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.  Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled \"The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet\" were informed by his experiences with [[Sketchpad]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], and the bloated code of commercial software.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, Kay's proposal to the United States [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) was granted, thus funding [[Viewpoints Research Institute]] for several years. The proposal title was: ''STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming'': A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf|title=Steps Toward The Reinvention of Programming \u2013 A Compact And Practical Model of Personal Computing As A Self-Exploratorium|author1=Alan Kay|author2=Dan Ingalls|author3=Yoshiki Ohshima|author4=Ian Piumarta|author5=[[Andreas Raab]]|access-date=2013-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508090431/http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-08|url-status=dead}} Proposal to NSF \u2013 Granted on August 31st 2006</ref> A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: \"The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days.
