A [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] is appointed by the Governor-General as the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]; the Prime Minister advises the Governor-General on the appointment of a Council of Ministers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]].

Since the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1951|1951 general election]], the party system has been dominated by the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), for a long time was dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers [[Vere Bird|Vere]] and [[Lester Bird]]. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. The [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|most recent elections]] to the House of Representatives were held on 12 June 2014. The [[Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party|Antigua Labour Party]] government was elected with fourteen seats. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] has three seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nConstitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on [[English law#Common law|English common law]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "More citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2020"}]}, {"name": "EngvarB", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2014"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Executive branch", "paragraphs": "As head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.\n\n{{Office-table}}\n|[[Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda|Monarch]]\n|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n|\n|6 February 1952\n|-\n|[[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]]\n|[[Rodney Williams (politician)|Rodney Williams]]\n|\n|14 August 2014\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Gaston Browne]]\n|[[Antigua Labour Party|Labour Party]]\n|13 June 2014\n|}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Legislative branch", "paragraphs": "[[File:Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda.JPG|250px|thumbnail|left|The parliament building in St. John's.]]\nAntigua and Barbuda elects on national level a legislature.
