In other words, an alkane consists of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure in which all the [[carbon\u2013carbon bond]]s are [[single bond|single]].<ref name=\"GoldBook alkanes\"/> Alkanes have the general chemical formula C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''+2</sub>. The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>), where ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large and complex molecules, like [[pentacontane]] (C<sub>50</sub>H<sub>102</sub>) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, an [[isomer]] of [[tetradecane]] (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>30</sub>).\n\n[[IUPAC]] defines alkanes as \"acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula {{Carbon}}<sub>''n''</sub>{{Hydrogen}}<sub>2''n''+2</sub>, and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms\". However, some sources use the term to denote ''any'' saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the [[cycloalkane]]s) or polycyclic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Hydrocarbons/Alkanes |title=Alkanes|date=28 November 2016|website = Chemistry LibreTexts}}</ref> despite their having a different general formula (i.e. cycloalkanes are C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''</sub>).\n\nIn an alkane, each carbon atom is [[Orbital hybridization|sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized]] with 4 [[sigma bonds]] (either C\u2013C or [[C\u2013H bond|C\u2013H]]), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (in a C\u2013H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its [[skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane.\n\nOne group of the [[higher alkanes]] are [[wax]]es, solids at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure]] (SATP), for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.\nWith their repeated \u2013CH<sub>2</sub> units, the alkanes constitute a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ in [[molecular mass]] by multiples of 14.03&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (the total mass of each such [[methylene bridge|methylene-bridge]] unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01&nbsp;u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01&nbsp;u each).\n\nMethane is produced by [[Methanogen|methanogenic bacteria]] and some long-chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi. Nevertheless, most alkanes do not have much [[biological activity]].  They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive [[functional groups]] of biological molecules.\n\nThe alkanes have two main commercial sources: [[petroleum]] (crude oil)<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Hydrocarbons (Alkanes, Alkenes And Alkynes)|author =Arora, A.|date=2006|publisher=Discovery Publishing House Pvt.

The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for \"normal\", although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points.

For example, [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are chiral due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3.

Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, [[propane]] and [[cyclopropane]], [[butane]] and [[cyclobutane]], etc.\n\nSubstituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes \u2013 the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by the [[Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog priority rules]].<ref name=reusch-nom/>\n\n===Trivial/common names===\n{{main|List of straight-chain alkanes}}\nThe trivial (non-[[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic]]) name for alkanes is 'paraffins'. Together, alkanes are known as the 'paraffin series'. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.\n\nIt is almost certain that the term 'paraffin' stems from the [[petrochemical industry]]. Branched-chain alkanes are called '''isoparaffins'''.

As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ([[molecular weight]]) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20\u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.<ref name = m&b/>\n\nA straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at \u221212 and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58&nbsp;\u00b0C, respectively.<ref name = m&b/> For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can \"lock\" into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.\n\nOn the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Alkanes/Properties_of_Alkanes/Cycloalkanes/Physical_Properties_of_Cycloalkanes|title=Physical Properties of Cycloalkanes|date=29 November 2015|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012447/https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Alkanes/Properties_of_Alkanes/Cycloalkanes/Physical_Properties_of_Cycloalkanes|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Melting points===\nThe [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the \"looser\" organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain ''n''-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30&nbsp;K and of ''n''-butane to ''n''-nonane at 90&nbsp;K | journal= Angew Chem Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988\u2013992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7<988::AID-ANIE988>3.3.CO;2-S}}</ref>\n\nThe melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for [[isoalkanes]] (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.\n\n===Conductivity and solubility===\nAlkanes do not conduct electricity in any way, nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason, they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] as they repel water.\n\nTheir solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.\n\nThe density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane\u2013water mixture.\n\n===Molecular geometry===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] -->\n[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridization in [[methane]].]]\nThe molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos<sup>\u22121</sup>(\u2212{{sfrac|3}})&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;109.47\u00b0 between them.\n\n===Bond lengths and bond angles===\nAn alkane molecule has only C\u2013H and C\u2013C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp<sup>3</sup> orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;m for a C\u2013H bond and 1.54&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;m for a C\u2013C bond.\n[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]\n\nThe spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals\u2014they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47\u00b0 between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.\n\n===Conformation===\n{{Main|Alkane stereochemistry}}\n\nThe structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon\u2013carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].\n[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]\n[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]\n\n[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C\u2013C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C\u2013C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120\u00b0 between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon\u2013carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].\n\nThe two conformations differ in energy: the staggered conformation is 12.6&nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).\n\nThis difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C\u2013C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH<sub>3</sub> group by 120\u00b0 relative to the other, is of the order of 10<sup>\u221211</sup>&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThe case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon\u2013carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.\n\n===Spectroscopic properties===\nVirtually all organic compounds contain carbon\u2013carbon, and carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a different functional group like [[Alcohol (chemistry)|\u2013OH]], [[Aldehyde|\u2013CHO]], [[Carboxylic acid|\u2013COOH]] etc.\n\n====Infrared spectroscopy====\nThe carbon\u2013hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm<sup>\u22121</sup>]], while the carbon\u2013carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. The carbon\u2013hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1375&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1450&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n====NMR spectroscopy====\nThe proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|''\u03b4''<sub>H</sub>]] = 0.5\u20131.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: ''\u03b4''<sub>C</sub> = 8\u201330 (primary, methyl, \u2013CH<sub>3</sub>), 15\u201355 (secondary, methylene, \u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013), 20\u201360 (tertiary, methyne, C\u2013H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.\n\n====Mass spectrometry====\nAlkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (''M''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH<sub>2</sub> groups.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised+organic+chemistry.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archived copy"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "17 February 2014"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192647/http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised%2Borganic%2Bchemistry.pdf"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "29 October 2013"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110508081631/http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "8 May 2011"}, {"name": "title", "value": "13.

For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes.

The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].\n[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]\n[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]\n\n[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C\u2013C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C\u2013C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120\u00b0 between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon\u2013carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].\n\nThe two conformations differ in energy: the staggered conformation is 12.6&nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).\n\nThis difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C\u2013C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH<sub>3</sub> group by 120\u00b0 relative to the other, is of the order of 10<sup>\u221211</sup>&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThe case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon\u2013carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Alkane stereochemistry"}]}], "id": 15}, {"title": "Spectroscopic properties", "paragraphs": "Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon\u2013carbon, and carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra.

The [[acid dissociation constant]] (p''K''<sub>a</sub>) values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 to 70, depending on the extrapolation method, hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). They are also extremely weak bases, undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid (''H''<sub>0</sub> ~ \u201312), although [[superacid]]s that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions (see: [[Methanium|methanium ion]]). Similarly, they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents (e.g., [[dioxirane]]s and salts containing the [[Tetrafluoroammonium|NF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> cation]]).  By virtue of their strongly C\u2013H bonds (~100 kcal/mol) and C\u2013C bonds (~90 kcal/mol, but usually less sterically accessible), they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals, although many electron-deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron-rich bonds (see below). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of \"lacking affinity\"). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.\n\n[[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.  Moreover, redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced state; in the case of methane, carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state (\u22124). Reaction with oxygen (''if'' present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction [[stoichiometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Free radical halogenation]] reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of [[haloalkanes]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation|C\u2013H bond activation]] reactions.\n\nIn highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5\u00b0) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.\n\nHowever, in general and perhaps surprisingly, when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable 1,2- and 1,3-alkyl\u2013alkyl steric interactions (worth ~3.1 kcal/mol and ~3.7 kcal/mol in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane, respectively) unavoidable, the branched alkanes are actually more thermodynamically stable than their linear (or less branched) isomers.

Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of \u0394<sub>c</sub>''H''<sup>\u2296</sup> than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.\n\n=== Reactions with halogens ===\n{{Main|Free radical halogenation}}\nAlkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called ''free radical halogenation'' reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.\n\nThese reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:\n* '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.\n* '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place\u2014the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.\n* '''Chain termination''' where the radicals recombine.\n\nExperiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:<ref name = m&b/>\n[[Image:Monobromination of propane.png|500px|center|Monobromination of [[propane]]]]\n\n=== Cracking ===\n{{Main|Cracking (chemistry)}}\nCracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a [[carbocation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C\u2013C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[Intramolecular reaction|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.\n\n=== Isomerization and reformation ===\nDragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes.<ref name=\"Asinger, Friedrich 1967\">{{cite book | author = Asinger, Friedrich | title = Paraffins; Chemistry and Technology | url = https://archive.org/details/paraffinschemist0000asin | url-access = registration | location = Oxford| publisher = Pergamon Press | date = 1967}}</ref> Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst.

The [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chlorides]]. [[Nucleophilic abstraction|Nucleophilic Abstraction]] can be used to separate an alkane from a metal. Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by [[transmetalation]] reactions.

These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:\n:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> \u2192 3&nbsp;CH<sub>4</sub> + 3&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThese hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial [[oil fields]]. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]].\n\nMethane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]].\n\nAlkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane clathrate]] (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is, therefore, a candidate for future fuels.\n\n===Biological occurrence===\nAcyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways.\n\n;Bacteria and archaea\n[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]]\nCertain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/static/classic_rxns/classic_reactions/fatty_acid_met.html|title=Metabolism of Alkanes and Fatty Acids \u2013 eQuilibrator 0.2 beta documentation|website=equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il|language=en|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds.

Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>48</sub>), [[pentacosane]] (C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>52</sub>) and [[heptacosane]] (C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>56</sub>) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,\nwhich will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Titan: Arizona in an Icebox?"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_science-results_0121.html"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Emily Lakdawalla"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "21 January 2004"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080406104505/http://planetary.org/news/2005/0121_Titan_Arizona_in_an_Icebox.html"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "6 April 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Mumma, M.J."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Detection of Abundant Ethane and Methane, Along with Carbon Monoxide and Water, in Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake: Evidence for Interstellar Origin"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Science"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1996"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "272"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1126/science.272.5266.1310"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "8650540"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Disanti"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "M.A."}, {"name": "last3", "value": "dello Russo"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "N."}, {"name": "last4", "value": "Fomenkova"}, {"name": "first4", "value": "M."}, {"name": "last5", "value": "Magee-Sauer"}, {"name": "first5", "value": "K."}, {"name": "last6", "value": "Kaminski"}, {"name": "first6", "value": "C.D."}, {"name": "last7", "value": "D.X."}, {"name": "first7", "value": "Xie"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "5266"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1996Sci...272.1310M"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1310\u20134"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Janssen"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "P.

The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.\n\n[[Propane]] and [[butane]] are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf |title=Using propane as a fuel |access-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012000108/http://ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.\n\nFrom [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances.\n\nAlkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.\n\nAlkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.\n\nAlkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].\n\nSome synthetic [[polymer]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Using propane as a fuel"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "27 November 2012"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131012000108/http://ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "12 October 2013"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}], "id": 35}, {"title": "Environmental transformations", "paragraphs": "{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nAlkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds.
