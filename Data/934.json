In contrast with other continents, it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground, lands under {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} occupying an unusually small part of the surface; while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of Asia or South America, but the area of land over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} is also quite insignificant, being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges. Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges. (So prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term [''Inselberg-Landschaft'', island mountain landscape] has been adopted in [[Germany]] to describe this kind of country, thought to be in great part the result of wind action.)\n\nAs a general rule, the higher tablelands lie to the east and south, while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable. Apart from the lowlands and the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range, the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus, the dividing line (somewhat concave to the north-west) running from the middle of the [[Red Sea]] to about 6 deg. S. on the west coast.\n\nAfrica can be divided into a number of geographic zones:\n\n*The coastal plains&nbsp;\u2014 often fringed seawards by mangrove swamps&nbsp;\u2014 never stretching far from the coast, apart from the lower courses of streams. Recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers. Elsewhere, the coastal lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces that constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus.\n*The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]]&nbsp;\u2014 orthographically distinct from the rest of the continent, being unconnected with and separated from the south by a depressed and desert area (the [[Sahara]]).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "600"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "950"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}, {"name": "lk", "value": "off"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "180"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}, {"name": "lk", "value": "off"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}, {"name": "lk", "value": "off"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Plateau region", "paragraphs": "[[File:Topography of africa.png|thumb|Topography of Africa]]\nThe high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, have a mean elevation of about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[South African Plateau]], as far as about 12\u00b0 S, is bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts. On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer. Due south, the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them. The largest of these level areas, the [[Great Karoo]], is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the [[Kalahari Desert]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe South African Plateau is connected towards [[East African plateau]], with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features. It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by [[Lake Nyasa]]), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFarther north the western hollow, known as the [[Albertine Rift]], is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] of [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]], [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], the first-named over {{convert|400|mi|km}} long and the longest freshwater lake in the world. Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a [[meridional line]] east of the eastern trough. The eastern branch of the [[East African Rift]], contains much smaller lakes, many of them [[brackish water|brackish]] and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being [[Lake Turkana]] or Basso Norok.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nA short distance east of this rift-valley is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] \u2014 with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the latter being {{convert|5889|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the culminating point of the whole continent&nbsp;\u2014 and [[Mount Kenya]], which is {{convert|5184|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Hardly less important is the [[Ruwenzori Range]], over {{convert|5060|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which lies east of the western trough. Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active.<ref name=EB1911/> This could cause most of the cities and states to be flooded with lava and ash.\n\nThe third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m. This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by [[Lake Tsana]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBoth in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower. The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of {{convert|1800|to|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} are reached. Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south-west, has a height of {{convert|4075|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while Clarence Peak, in [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]], the first of the line of islands, rises to over {{convert|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "600"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "400"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "3", "value": "km"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "5889"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "5184"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "5060"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1500"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1800"}, {"name": "2", "value": "to"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2400"}, {"name": "4", "value": "m"}, {"name": "5", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "4075"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2700"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Plains", "paragraphs": "Much of Africa is made up of plains of the [[pediplain]] and [[etchplain]] type often occurring as steps.<ref name=Guillocheauetal2017/><ref name=Coltortietal2007>{{cite journal |last1=Coltorti |first1=M. |last2=Dramis |first2=F.|last3=Ollier |first3=C.D\n\n|author-link3=Cliff Ollier |date=2007 |title=Planation surfaces in Northern Ethiopia |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=89 |issue= |pages=287\u2013296 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.12.007}}</ref> The etchplains are commonly associated with [[laterite]] soil and [[inselberg]]s.<ref name=Guillocheauetal2017>{{cite journal |last1=Guillocheau |first1=Fran\u00e7ois  |last2=Simon |first2=Brendan|last3=Baby |first3=Guillaume|last4=Bessin |first4=Paul|last5=Robin |first5=C\u00e9cile|last6=Dauteuil |first6=Olivier |date=2017 |title=Planation surfaces as a record of mantle dynamics: The case example of Africa |url= |journal=[[Gondwana Research]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}</ref> [[Inselberg#Geology|Inselberg]]-dotted plains are common in Africa including [[Tanzania]],<ref>[[\u00c5ke Sundborg|Sundborg, \u00c5.]], & [[Anders Rapp|Rapp, A.]] (1986).

The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the main African rivers belong: Nile (the longest river of Africa), Congo (river with the highest water discharge on the continent) and the Niger, which flows half of its length through the arid areas. The largest lakes are the following: Lake Victoria (Lake Ukerewe), Lake Chad, in the centre of the continent, Lake Tanganyika, lying between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. There is also the considerably large Lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world -Malawi. There are also numerous water dams throughout the continent: Kariba on the river of Zambezi, Asuan in Egypt on the river of Nile and the biggest dam of the continent lying completely in The republic of Ghana is called Akosombo on the Volta river (Fobil 2003).\nThe high lake plateau of the [[African Great Lakes]] region contains the headwaters of both the Nile and the [[Congo River|Congo]].\n\nThe break-up of [[Gondwana]] in [[Late Cretaceous]] and [[Cenozoic]] times led to a major reorganization of the river courses of various large African rivers including the [[Congo River|Congo]], [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Nile]], [[Orange River|Orange]], [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goudie |first1=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |date=2005 |title=The drainage of Africa since the Cretaceous |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67 |issue= |pages=437\u2013456 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2004.11.008|access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===Flowing to the Mediterranean Sea===\nThe upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighborhood of the equator.<ref name=EB1911/> From there, streams pour eastward into [[Lake Victoria]], the largest lake in Africa (covering over 26,000 square m.), and to the west and north into [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]].

Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through [[Lake Mweru]] and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa.

(The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.)<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFarther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall. The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.<ref name=EB1911/>\n[[File:Africa FebAug.gif|thumb|width=220|left|Vegetation in February and August]]\nThe rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of [[Mount Cameroon]], where there is a mean annual rainfall of about {{convert|10000|mm|0|abbr=on}} as compared with a mean of {{convert|11600|mm||0|abbr=on}} at [[Cherrapunji]], in [[Meghalaya]], [[India]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once. Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in [[Egypt]] as the [[khamsin]], on the Mediterranean as the [[sirocco]], it is called on the Guinea coast the [[harmattan]]. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the [[Kalahari Desert]] in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "multiple image\n", "values": [{"name": "image1", "value": "Africa_1971_2000_mean_temperature.png"}, {"name": "image2", "value": "Africa_1971-2000_mean_precipitation.png"}, {"name": "caption1", "value": "Africa mean annual temperature"}, {"name": "caption2", "value": "Africa mean annual precipitation"}, {"name": "width1", "value": "120"}, {"name": "width2", "value": "120"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Key Elements of Africa\u2019s Geographic Landscape and Climate Patterns"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The Saylor Foundation]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "May 4, 2012"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hist252-1.3-Key-Elements-of-Africa\u2019s-Geographic-Landscape-and-Climate-Patterns.pdf"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "10000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mm"}, {"name": "3", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "11600"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mm"}, {"name": "4", "value": "0"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 12}, {"title": "Health", "paragraphs": "The [[climate of Africa]] lends itself to certain environmental diseases, the most serious of which are: [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[yellow fever]].

There is not yet a vaccine for malaria, which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in Africa. Recently, the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria.\n\nYellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to Africa.
