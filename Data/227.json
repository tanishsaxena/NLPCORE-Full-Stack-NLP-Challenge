His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to [[Hollywood]]. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). ''Rebecca'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture]], although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]];<ref name=Rebecca/> he was also nominated for ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944) and ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award.  \n\nThe \"[[Hitchcockian]]\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film \"is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\"{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}} \n\nAfter a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[Dial M For Murder]]'' (1954).  By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films [[List of films considered the best|often ranked]] among the greatest of all time: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.<ref name=\"AFI top 100\">{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Films of All Time |url=https://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |website=American Film Institute |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>  In 2012, ''Vertigo'' replaced [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[British Film Institute]]'s greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics.<ref name=Christie2012/> By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]],{{efn|The films selected for the [[National Film Registry]] are ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).<ref name=loc>{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=21 December 2018}}{{pb}} \n[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/descriptions-and-essays/ \"Brief Descriptions and Expanded Essays of National Film Registry Titles\"].

It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four projects on which [[Cary Grant]] worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role. Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English  [[Confidence trick|con man]] whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw ([[Joan Fontaine]]).{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=434\u2013435}} In one scene Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; the light makes sure that the audience's attention is on the glass. Grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142\u2013143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer.

What I wanted to do was that the wife was aware that she was going to be murdered by her husband, so she wrote a letter to her mother saying that she was very much in love with him, she didn't want live anymore, she was going to be killed but society should be protected. She therefore brings up this fatal glass of milk, drinks it and before she does she says, \"Will you mail this letter to mother?\" Then she drinks the milk and dies.

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\".<ref name=Spoto1999p267>The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

The film is the first of four projects on which [[Cary Grant]] worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role.

Grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142\u2013143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer.

She therefore brings up this fatal glass of milk, drinks it and before she does she says, \"Will you mail this letter to mother?\" Then she drinks the milk and dies.

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\".<ref name=Spoto1999p267>The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\".<ref name=Spoto1999p267>The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

To lose weight, he stopped drinking, drank black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and ate steak and salad for dinner, but it was hard to maintain; Spoto writes that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years.

It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the [[British War Office]] film vaults to London's [[Imperial War Museum]] and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it: ''Memory of the Camps''.

With ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). The film appears to have been shot in a single take, but it was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from 4-{{frac|2}} to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. The film features [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock.

Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including [[Donald Spoto]] and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''Vertigo'' is the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]''-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires.

After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the \"Necktie Murders\", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites as in ''Strangers on a Train''.<ref>{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=114\u2013115}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Frenzy'', Hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time.

Both actors, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] and [[Anna Massey]], refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=513\u2013514}} Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the longtime head of Hollywood's [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's \"inescapable inferences\".<ref>{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=249}}</ref>\n\n''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of \"Madam\" Blanche Tyler, played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi-driver lover [[Bruce Dern]], making a living from her phony powers. While ''Family Plot'' was based on the [[Victor Canning]] novel ''[[The Rainbird Pattern]]'' (1972), the novel's tone is more sinister. Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] originally wrote the film with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2017"}]}, {"name": "page needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2017"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Smith"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "272\u2013274"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Stephens"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Andrew"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The sound of Hitchcock: How Bernard Herrmann's music brought his films to life"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Sydney Morning Herald"}, {"name": "date", "value": "9 January 2016"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Smith"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "273\u2013274"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/topaz/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Topaz"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Rotten Tomatoes"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "15 December 2017"}]}, {"name": "failed verification", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2017"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Leitch"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "114\u2013115"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Evans"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2017"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Spoto"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "513\u2013514"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "McGilligan"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2003"}, {"name": "p", "value": "249"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2017"}]}], "id": 26}, {"title": "Knighthood and death", "paragraphs": "<!--add American Film Institute Life Achievement Award and speech about his wife-->Toward the end of his life, Hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with [[James Costigan]], [[Ernest Lehman]] and [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]].

Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n===Relationship with actors===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor= #E0E6F8\n |quote =&nbsp;...

He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation.

He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock four times,<ref>{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}</ref> and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Writing, storyboards and production===\nHitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.<ref>{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}</ref> He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:\n\n{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score.

He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.<ref>Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{Citation|last=Pallant|first=Chris|title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding|date=2015|work=Storyboarding: A Critical History|volume=|pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris|series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6|isbn=978-1-137-02760-3|last2=Price|first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]\nThis view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde. In ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Bidisha"}, {"name": "authorlink1", "value": "Bidisha"}, {"name": "title", "value": "What's wrong with Hitchcock's women"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/alfred-hitchcock-women-psycho-the-birds-bidisha"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The Guardian"}, {"name": "date", "value": "21 October 2010"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Mulvey"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1989"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Roger"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Ebert"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Vertigo"}, {"name": "date", "value": "13 October 1996"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Chicago Sun-Times"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "In 1967 Hitchcock told Truffaut: \"I think the most interesting women, sexually, are the English women.

He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so.

After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work.
