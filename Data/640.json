Asgard is attested in a variety of sources, including the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, in the ''Prose Edda'' (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson), and in [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] form in ''Heimskringla'' (also written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson). The ''Prose Edda'' describes [[Valhalla]], the god [[Odin]]'s afterlife hall for a portion of the battlefield slain, as located in Asgard.<ref name=\"SIMEK-2007-20\">Simek (2007:20).</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Norse cosmology#Nine Worlds|Nine Worlds]] are nowhere detailed in the Old Norse corpus, some scholars have proposed that Asgard may have been considered among them.<ref name=\"BELLOWS\">For example, drawing from the eddic corpus, [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] (1923) proposes that the nine worlds consist of the following: \"The world of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim ...), of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim ...), of the dark elves (Svartalfheim), of the dead (Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir ... but the ninth is uncertain)\" (Bellows 2004 [1923]:3).</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "A location associated with the gods in Norse Mythology"}]}, {"name": "about", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the location in Norse Mythology"}, {"name": "2", "value": "other uses"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Notes", "paragraphs": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "* [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Bellows, Henry Adams]]. 2004 [1923].
