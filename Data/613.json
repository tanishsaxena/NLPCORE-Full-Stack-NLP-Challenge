(1970), p. 48: \"mass is an adiabatically inhibited variable.\"</ref> The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption. For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings. Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic. The same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system.\n\nThe assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible. Such assumptions are idealizations. The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such \"perfect\" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works. According to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], when sound travels in a gas, there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic. For such an adiabatic process, the [[Elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] ([[Young's modulus]]) can be expressed as {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''\u03b3P''}}, where {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]] at constant pressure and at constant volume ({{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''C<sub>p</sub>''|''C<sub>v</sub>''}}}} ) and {{math|''P''}} is the pressure of the gas .\n\n=== Various applications of the adiabatic assumption ===\n\nFor a closed system, one may write the [[first law of thermodynamics]] as : {{math|\u0394''U'' {{=}} ''Q'' \u2013 ''W''}}, where {{math|\u0394''U''}} denotes the change of the system's internal energy, {{math|''Q''}} the quantity of energy added to it as heat, and {{math|''W''}} the work done by the system on its surroundings.\n\n*If the system has rigid walls such that work cannot be transferred in or out ({{math|''W'' {{=}} 0}}), and the walls of the system are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat ({{math|''Q'' > 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise.\n*If the system has rigid walls such that pressure\u2013volume work cannot be done, and the system walls are adiabatic ({{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}), but energy is added as isochoric work in the form of friction or the stirring of a viscous fluid within the system ({{math|''W'' < 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise.\n*If the system walls are adiabatic ({{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}), but not rigid ({{math|''W'' \u2260 0}}), and, in a fictive idealized process, energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless, non-viscous pressure\u2013volume work ({{math|''W'' < 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise. Such a process is called an [[isentropic process]] and is said to be \"reversible\". Fictively, if the process is reversed the energy can be recovered entirely as work done by the system. If the system contains a compressible gas and is reduced in volume, the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced, and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system, but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic ({{math|\u0394''S'' {{=}} 0}}). Should the work be added in such a way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system, then the process is not isentropic, and if there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise, the process is said to be \"irreversible\", and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work.\n*If the walls of a system are not adiabatic, and energy is transferred in as heat, entropy is transferred into the system with the heat. Such a process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic, having {{math|''Q'' > 0}}, and {{math|\u0394''S'' > 0}} according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]].\n\nNaturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).\n\nThe transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds. In one such kind, there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc.), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by {{math|''P'' d''V''}}).

A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls, without phase change, will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable.

Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature. In contrast, [[free expansion]] is an [[isothermal]] process for an ideal gas.\n\n'''Adiabatic heating''' occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a [[piston]] compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time. This finds practical application in [[diesel engines]] which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.\n\nAdiabatic heating occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] when an [[air mass]] descends, for example, in a [[katabatic wind]], [[Foehn wind]], or [[chinook wind]] flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process.\n\n'''Adiabatic cooling''' occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the Earth's atmosphere with [[orographic lifting]] and [[lee waves]], and this can form [[Pileus (meteorology)|pileus]] or [[lenticular cloud]]s.\n\nAdiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via [[adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic demagnetisation]], where the change in [[magnetic field]] on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an [[expanding universe]] can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid.

The model assumptions are: the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre (1&nbsp;L = 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> = 0.001&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>); the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only (thus a diatomic gas with 5 degrees of freedom, and so {{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|7|5}}}}); the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1&nbsp;L volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to 0.1&nbsp;L by the piston); and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27&nbsp;\u00b0C, or 300&nbsp;K, and a pressure of 1&nbsp;bar = 100&nbsp;kPa, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).\n\n: <math> P_1 V^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}_1 = 100\\,000~\\text{Pa} \\times (0.001~\\text{m}^3)^\\frac75 </math>\n: <math> = 10^5 \\times 6.31 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5} = 6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5},</math>\n\nso our adiabatic constant for this example is about 6.31&nbsp;Pa&thinsp;m<sup>4.2</sup>.\n\nThe gas is now compressed to a 0.1&nbsp;L (0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas through the walls). The adiabatic constant remains the same, but with the resulting pressure unknown\n\n: <math> P_2 V^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}_1 = 6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5} = P \\times (0.0001~\\text{m}^3)^\\frac75, </math>\n\nso solving for ''P<sub>2</sub>'':\n\n: <math> P_2 = \\frac{6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5}}{(0.0001~\\text{m}^3)^\\frac75} = \\frac{6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}^{21/5}} = 2.51 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa}, </math>\n\nor 25.1&nbsp;bar. Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure.\n\nWe can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law, ''PV''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''nRT'' (''n'' is amount of gas in moles and ''R'' the gas constant for that gas). Our initial conditions being 100&nbsp;kPa of pressure, 1&nbsp;L volume, and 300&nbsp;K of temperature, our experimental constant (''nR'') is:\n\n: <math> \\frac{PV}{T} = \\operatorname{constant}_2 = \\frac{10^5~\\text{Pa} \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m}^3}{300~\\text{K}} = 0.333~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\text{K}^{-1}.</math>\n\nWe know the compressed gas has {{mvar|V}}&nbsp;= 0.1&nbsp;L and {{mvar|P}}&nbsp;= {{val|2.51|e=6|u=Pa}}, so we can solve for temperature:\n\n: <math> T = \\frac{P V}{\\operatorname{constant}_2} = \\frac{2.51 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa} \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{m}^3}{0.333~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\text{K}^{-1}} = 753~\\text{K}. </math>\n\nThat is a final temperature of 753&nbsp;K, or 479&nbsp;\u00b0C, or 896&nbsp;\u00b0F, well above the ignition point of many fuels. This is why a high-compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause [[engine knocking]] when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a [[supercharger]] with an [[intercooler]] to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous. A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 16:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature, which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel.\n\n===Adiabatic free expansion of a gas===\n{{See also|Free expansion}}\nFor an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum. Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the first law of thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.\n\n===Derivation of ''P''\u2013''V'' relation for adiabatic heating and cooling===\nThe definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, {{math|''\u03b4Q'' {{=}} 0}}. Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics,\n\n:<math> \\text{(1)} \\qquad d U + \\delta W = \\delta Q = 0, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''dU''}} is the change in the internal energy of the system and {{math|''\u03b4W''}} is work done ''by'' the system. Any work ({{math|''\u03b4W''}}) done must be done at the expense of internal energy {{math|''U''}}, since no heat {{math|''\u03b4Q''}} is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure\u2013volume work {{math|''\u03b4W''}} done ''by'' the system is defined as\n\n:<math> \\text{(2)} \\qquad \\delta W = P \\, dV. </math>\n\nHowever, {{math|''P''}} does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with {{math|''V''}}.\n\nIt is desired to know how the values of {{math|''dP''}} and {{math|''dV''}} relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds. For an ideal gas ( recall ideal gas law  {{math|''PV'' {{=}} ''nRT''}} ) the internal energy is given by\n\n:<math> \\text{(3)} \\qquad U = \\alpha n R T = \\alpha P V, </math> \n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b1''}} is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two, {{math|''R''}} is the [[universal gas constant]] and {{math|''n''}} is the number of moles in the system (a constant).\n\nDifferentiating equation (3) yields\n\n:<math> \\text{(4)} \\qquad d U = \\alpha n R \\, dT\n                  = \\alpha \\, d (P V)\n                  = \\alpha (P \\, dV + V \\, dP). </math>\n\nEquation (4) is often expressed as {{math|''dU'' {{=}} ''nC<sub>V</sub> dT''}} because {{math|''C<sub>V</sub>'' {{=}} ''\u03b1R''}}.\n\nNow substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain\n\n: <math> -P \\, dV = \\alpha P \\, dV + \\alpha V \\, dP,</math>\n\nfactorize {{math|\u2212''P dV''}}:\n\n: <math> -(\\alpha + 1) P \\, dV = \\alpha V \\, dP,</math>\n\nand divide both sides by {{math|''PV''}}:\n\n: <math> -(\\alpha + 1) \\frac{dV}{V} = \\alpha \\frac{dP}{P}. </math>\n\nAfter integrating the left and right sides from {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} to {{math|''V''}} and from {{math|''P''<sub>0</sub>}} to {{math|''P''}} and changing the sides respectively,\n\n: <math> \\ln \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha + 1}{\\alpha} \\ln \\left( \\frac{V}{V_0} \\right). </math>\n\nExponentiate both sides, substitute {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03b1'' + 1|''\u03b1''}}}} with {{math|''\u03b3''}}, the heat capacity ratio\n\n: <math> \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{V}{V_0} \\right)^{-\\gamma}, </math>\n\nand eliminate the negative sign to obtain\n\n: <math> \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{V_0}{V} \\right)^\\gamma. </math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n: <math> \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V}{V_0} \\right)^\\gamma = 1,</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math> P_0 V_0^\\gamma = P V^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}. </math>\n\n===Derivation of ''P''\u2013''T'' relation for adiabatic heating and cooling===\n\nSubstituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain\n\n: <math> P \\left(\\frac{n R T}{P}\\right)^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}, </math>\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n: <math> P^{1-\\gamma} T^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}. </math>\n\n===Derivation of discrete formula and work expression===\nThe change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to\n\n:<math> \\text{(1)} \\qquad \\Delta U = \\alpha R nT_2 -

One approach to these problems was to regard heat, measured by calorimetry, as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was recognized as a form of energy, and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized. The view that eventually established itself, and is currently regarded as right, is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom, and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential. In this light, heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a [[State function|state variable]], but, rather, is a variable that describes a process of transfer between two bodies.

It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall. In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be ''adiabatic'', though often far from isentropic, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall.\n\n[[Quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum statistical mechanics]], however, use the word ''adiabatic'' [[Adiabatic theorem#Diabatic vs. adiabatic processes|in a very different sense]], one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense. In quantum theory, the word ''adiabatic'' can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.\n\nOn the one hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done ''adiabatically''. The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible. While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre- and post-compression, eigenstates. Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system. For example, [[Max Born]] writes \"Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly. In this case, to a very high approximation\n\n:<math>c_1^2=1,\\,\\,c_2^2=0,\\,\\,c_3^2=0,\\,...\\,,</math>\n\nthat is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation. Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Born, M. |date=1927 |title=Physical aspects of quantum mechanics |journal=Nature |volume=119 |issue=2992 |pages=354\u2013357|bibcode = 1927Natur.119..354B |doi = 10.1038/119354a0 }} (Translation by Robert Oppenheimer.)</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes. In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be ''adiabatic'', and the contrary word ''diabatic'' is applied to it. One might guess that perhaps Clausius, if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that \"internal work\" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat. The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.\n\nThus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated. But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term. The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Born, M."}, {"name": "date", "value": "1927"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Physical aspects of quantum mechanics"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Nature"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "119"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2992"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "354\u2013357"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1927Natur.119..354B"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1038/119354a0"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2015"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "* [[Fire piston]]\n* [[Heat burst]]\n; Related physics topics\n* [[First law of thermodynamics]]\n* [[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)]]\n* [[Adiabatic conductivity]]\n* [[Adiabatic lapse rate]]\n* [[Total air temperature]]\n* [[Magnetic refrigeration]]\n; Related thermodynamic processes\n* [[Cyclic process]]\n* [[Isobaric process]]\n* [[Isenthalpic process]]\n* [[Isentropic process]]\n* [[Isochoric process]]\n* [[Isothermal process]]\n* [[Polytropic process]]\n* [[Quasistatic process]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 14}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;General\n* {{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Silbey |year=2004 |title=Physical chemistry |location=Hoboken |publisher=Wiley |page=55 |isbn=978-0-471-21504-2 |display-authors=etal}}\n* Broholm, Collin. \"Adiabatic free expansion\".
