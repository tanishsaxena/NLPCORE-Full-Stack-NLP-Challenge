Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]].\n\nTraditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as \"assault\". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.\n\nLegal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "about", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the criminal act"}, {"name": "2", "value": "tortious aspects of assault"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Assault (tort)"}, {"name": "4", "value": "other uses"}, {"name": "5", "value": "Assault (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Assailants"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the EP by Lydia"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Assailants (EP)"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-overview.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Assault and Battery Overview"}, {"name": "website", "value": "criminal.findlaw.com"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "18 September 2016"}]}, {"name": "TOC limit", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Related definitions", "paragraphs": "\n===Battery===\nIn jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat.

Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to \"tap\", \"pinch\", \"push\", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.\n\nThe potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/> This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.\n\nSome variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:\n\n* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].\n\nAn individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.\n\n===India===\nThe Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,<ref>{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}</ref> sections 351 through 358.\n{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - \"Indian Penal Code\"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Code further explains that \"mere words do not amount to an assault.

It related to officers of the [[Serious Organized Crime Agency]] and was repealed when that agency was abolished.\n\n====England and Wales====\n{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}\n\nEnglish law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or [[common assault]]) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. The terms \"assault\" and \"common assault\" often encompass the separate offence of battery, even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].\n\nA common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.\n\n=====Aggravated assault=====\nAn assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing \"actual bodily harm\" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, \"[[grievous bodily harm]]\" (GBH).\n;Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].\n;Inflicting grievous bodily harm: Also referred to as \"malicious wounding\" or \"unlawful wounding\". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as \"wounding with intent\". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n\nOther aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:\n;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].\n;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].\n;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].\n;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].\n;Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:\n:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or\n:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by section/10 section 10(1) of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].\n;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]].

It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.\n\n====Scotland====\nIn [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an \"attack upon the person of another\".<ref>MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155</ref> There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''<ref>1987 SCCR 534</ref> wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:\n\n{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}\n\nScottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply \"evil intent\",<ref>MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30</ref> although this has been held to mean no more than that assault \"cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently\" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a \"hold-up\" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.\n\nIt is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nSeveral offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:\n* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;\n* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43\n* Common assault: under section 47\n* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47\nThe [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:\n* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.\n\nThat Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.<ref>{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nEach state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State.

However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFour elements were required at [[common law]]:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|doi=10.1177/002201839505900307}}</ref>\n* The apparent, present ability to carry out;\n* An unlawful attempt;\n* To commit a violent injury; \n* Upon another.\n\nAs the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.\n\nThe crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be a natural person. Thus, unless the attack is directed by a person, an animal attack does not constitute an assault. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats a [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].\n\nPossible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof that may be raised in response to an assault charge include:\n* Lack of intent: A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.\n* Mutual consent: A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior. For example, boxers who are fighting in an organized boxing match and do not significantly deviate from the rules of the sport cannot be charged with assault.\n\n====State laws====\nLaws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Assault is often subdivided into two categories, simple assault and aggravated assault.\n* Simple assault involves an intentional act that causes another person to be in reasonable fear of an imminent battery. Simple assault may also involve an attempt to cause harm to another person, where that attempt does not succeed. Simple assault is typically classified as a [[misdemeanor]] offense, unless the victim is a member of a protected class, such as being a law enforcement officer.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web |title=MCL 750.81d, Assaulting, battering, resisting, obstructing, opposing person performing duty; felony; penalty; other violations; consecutive terms; definitions. |url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-750-81d |website=Michigan Legislature |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref> Even as a misdemeanor, an assault conviction may still result in incarceration and in a criminal record.\n* Aggravated assault involves more serious actions, such as an assault that is committed with the intent to cause a serious bodily injury, or an assault that is committed with a deadly weapon such as a firearm. Aggravated assault is typically classified as a [[felony]] offense.\n\nModern American statutes may define assault as including:\n* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another \n* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing bodily harm by reckless operation of a [[motor vehicle]] (vehicular assault).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.522|title=RCW 46.61.522: Vehicular assault  \u2014  Penalty.|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* threatening another in a menacing manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2006/s28index/s2803010000.html|title=\u00a7 28-310 \u2014 Assault in the third degree; penalty. :: Chapter 28 \u2014 Crimes and Punishments: 2006 Nebraska Revised Statutes :: Nebraska Revised Statutes: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia|work=Justia Law|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* knowingly causing physical contact with another person knowing the other person will regard the contact as offensive or provocative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C500-599/5650000070.HTM|title=Section 565-070  Until December 31, 2016--Assault in the|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing stupor, unconsciousness or physical injury by intentionally administering a drug or controlled substance without consent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2005/title53a/sec53a-60.html|title=Sec. 53a-60.

Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, \"hubris\" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.\n\nViolations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible [[rape]] of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.<ref>MacDowell (1976) p. 25.</ref> Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.\n\nHubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, \"outrageous treatment\", in general.\n\nThe meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an \"act of hubris\", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[At\u00eb]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.\n\nCrucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (tim\u0113) and shame. The concept of tim\u0113 included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game.

Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to \"tap\", \"pinch\", \"push\", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.\n\nThe potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/> This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.\n\nSome variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:\n\n* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].\n\nAn individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "10 May 2015"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "30 April 2015"}]}], "id": 11}, {"title": "India", "paragraphs": "The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,<ref>{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}</ref> sections 351 through 358.\n{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - \"Indian Penal Code\"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Code further explains that \"mere words do not amount to an assault.

However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFour elements were required at [[common law]]:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|doi=10.1177/002201839505900307}}</ref>\n* The apparent, present ability to carry out;\n* An unlawful attempt;\n* To commit a violent injury; \n* Upon another.\n\nAs the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.\n\nThe crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be a natural person. Thus, unless the attack is directed by a person, an animal attack does not constitute an assault. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats a [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].\n\nPossible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof that may be raised in response to an assault charge include:\n* Lack of intent: A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.\n* Mutual consent: A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior. For example, boxers who are fighting in an organized boxing match and do not significantly deviate from the rules of the sport cannot be charged with assault.\n\n====State laws====\nLaws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Assault is often subdivided into two categories, simple assault and aggravated assault.\n* Simple assault involves an intentional act that causes another person to be in reasonable fear of an imminent battery. Simple assault may also involve an attempt to cause harm to another person, where that attempt does not succeed. Simple assault is typically classified as a [[misdemeanor]] offense, unless the victim is a member of a protected class, such as being a law enforcement officer.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web |title=MCL 750.81d, Assaulting, battering, resisting, obstructing, opposing person performing duty; felony; penalty; other violations; consecutive terms; definitions. |url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-750-81d |website=Michigan Legislature |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref> Even as a misdemeanor, an assault conviction may still result in incarceration and in a criminal record.\n* Aggravated assault involves more serious actions, such as an assault that is committed with the intent to cause a serious bodily injury, or an assault that is committed with a deadly weapon such as a firearm. Aggravated assault is typically classified as a [[felony]] offense.\n\nModern American statutes may define assault as including:\n* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another \n* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing bodily harm by reckless operation of a [[motor vehicle]] (vehicular assault).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.522|title=RCW 46.61.522: Vehicular assault  \u2014  Penalty.|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* threatening another in a menacing manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2006/s28index/s2803010000.html|title=\u00a7 28-310 \u2014 Assault in the third degree; penalty. :: Chapter 28 \u2014 Crimes and Punishments: 2006 Nebraska Revised Statutes :: Nebraska Revised Statutes: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia|work=Justia Law|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* knowingly causing physical contact with another person knowing the other person will regard the contact as offensive or provocative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C500-599/5650000070.HTM|title=Section 565-070  Until December 31, 2016--Assault in the|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing stupor, unconsciousness or physical injury by intentionally administering a drug or controlled substance without consent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2005/title53a/sec53a-60.html|title=Sec. 53a-60.

Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Assault is often subdivided into two categories, simple assault and aggravated assault.\n* Simple assault involves an intentional act that causes another person to be in reasonable fear of an imminent battery. Simple assault may also involve an attempt to cause harm to another person, where that attempt does not succeed. Simple assault is typically classified as a [[misdemeanor]] offense, unless the victim is a member of a protected class, such as being a law enforcement officer.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web |title=MCL 750.81d, Assaulting, battering, resisting, obstructing, opposing person performing duty; felony; penalty; other violations; consecutive terms; definitions. |url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-750-81d |website=Michigan Legislature |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref> Even as a misdemeanor, an assault conviction may still result in incarceration and in a criminal record.\n* Aggravated assault involves more serious actions, such as an assault that is committed with the intent to cause a serious bodily injury, or an assault that is committed with a deadly weapon such as a firearm. Aggravated assault is typically classified as a [[felony]] offense.\n\nModern American statutes may define assault as including:\n* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another \n* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing bodily harm by reckless operation of a [[motor vehicle]] (vehicular assault).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.522|title=RCW 46.61.522: Vehicular assault  \u2014  Penalty.|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* threatening another in a menacing manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2006/s28index/s2803010000.html|title=\u00a7 28-310 \u2014 Assault in the third degree; penalty. :: Chapter 28 \u2014 Crimes and Punishments: 2006 Nebraska Revised Statutes :: Nebraska Revised Statutes: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia|work=Justia Law|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* knowingly causing physical contact with another person knowing the other person will regard the contact as offensive or provocative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C500-599/5650000070.HTM|title=Section 565-070  Until December 31, 2016--Assault in the|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing stupor, unconsciousness or physical injury by intentionally administering a drug or controlled substance without consent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2005/title53a/sec53a-60.html|title=Sec. 53a-60.

Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, \"hubris\" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.\n\nViolations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible [[rape]] of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.<ref>MacDowell (1976) p. 25.</ref> Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.\n\nHubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, \"outrageous treatment\", in general.\n\nThe meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an \"act of hubris\", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[At\u00eb]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.\n\nCrucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (tim\u0113) and shame. The concept of tim\u0113 included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of \"insolence, contempt, and excessive violence\".\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 31}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "* [[Domestic violence]]\n* [[Gay bashing]]\n* [[Hate crime]]\n* [[Mayhem (crime)|Mayhem]]\n* [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 32}, {"title": "Notes", "paragraphs": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 33}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "* {{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet & Maxwell}} chapter 9\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Baker"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Dennis"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "William"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Glanville"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Textbook of Criminal Law"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "London, Sweet & Maxwell"}]}], "id": 34}, {"title": "External links", "paragraphs": "{{wiktionary|beat up}}\n{{Wiktionary|assault}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090201151414/http://criminallawonline.com/artassaults.php A guide to the non fatal offences against the person]\n\n[[Category:Assault| ]]\n[[Category:Crimes]]", "attributes": [{"name": "wiktionary", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "beat up"}]}, {"name": "Wiktionary", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "assault"}]}], "id": 35}]}
