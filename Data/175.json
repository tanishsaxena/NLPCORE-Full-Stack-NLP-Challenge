In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> In other stories, authors have used the word \"android\" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nEric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a \"synthetic human being\", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:\n* the mummy type \u2013 where androids are made of \"dead things\" or \"stiff, inanimate, natural material\", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues\n* the golem type \u2013 androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi\n* the automaton type \u2013 androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots<ref name=\"Wilson2006\"/>\n\nAlthough human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "At the Mechanical Theater"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[London Times]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "22 December 1795"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ&dq=patent:40891%7C"}, {"name": "title", "value": "U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automation''"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Google Patents]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "7 January 2007"}]}, {"name": "Cite episode", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Rough Whimper of Insanity"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.fancast.com/tv/Total-Recall-2070/10604/full-episodes"}, {"name": "series", "value": "Total Recall 2070"}, {"name": "serieslink", "value": "Total Recall 2070"}, {"name": "credits", "value": "Levin, Drew S.

In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.\n\nThe Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.\n\nThe [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a [[3D scanner]] to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.\n\n===Singapore===\nProf Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine.  Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple's [[Siri]] or Microsoft's [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]]. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly.\n\nAssoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R&D development in [[tele-presence robotics]], creating EDGAR.

In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.\n\nThe Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.\n\nThe [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a [[3D scanner]] to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Expand section", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "more recent examples and additional citations"}, {"name": "section", "value": "1"}, {"name": "date", "value": "October 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Sa\u00efd"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Zeghloul"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Med Amine"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Laribi"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Jean-Pierre"}, {"name": "last3", "value": "Gazeau"}, {"name": "authorlink3", "value": "Jean-Pierre Gazeau"}, {"name": "date", "value": "21 September 2015"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Springer"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9783319223681"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Humanoid History -WABOT-"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Historical Android Projects"}, {"name": "work", "value": "androidworld.com"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=NgLLBQAAQBAJ&pg=SA3-PA1"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Handbook of Digital Human Modeling: Research for Applied Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Vincent G."}, {"name": "last", "value": "Duffy"}, {"name": "date", "value": "19 April 2016"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "CRC Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781420063523"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.uc3m.es/uc3m/dpto/IN/dpin04/2historygroupwabo2.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "2history"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "31 August 2007"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071012203052/http://uc3m.es/uc3m/dpto/IN/dpin04/2historygroupwabo2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "12 October 2007"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/P3/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "P3"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Honda Worldwide"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 September 2007"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Singapore", "paragraphs": "Prof Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine.
