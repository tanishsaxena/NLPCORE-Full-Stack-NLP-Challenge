Autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo, and both [[Pope Stephen III]] and [[Charlemagne]] intervened.  The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin.\n\nHe wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the [[Apocalypse]], on the [[Psalms]], and on the [[Song of Solomon]]; ''Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso''; ''[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the Virgin''; and a ''Combat between the Virtues and the Vices''.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ambrose, Autpert}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] gave a homily about him in Saint Peter's square. In this homily, Autpert's death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779).<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english On Ambrose Autpert, \"1st Mariologist of the West\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023703/http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english |date=April 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "lang-la", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "'''Ambrosius Autpertus'''"}]}, {"name": "Cite EB1911", "values": [{"name": "wstitle", "value": "Ambrose, Autpert"}]}, {"name": "webarchive ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023703/http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 27, 2009"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "<references/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "External links", "paragraphs": "{{Catholic Encyclopedia poster|Ambrose Autpert}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ambrose, Autpert}}\n[[Category:730s births]]\n[[Category:784 deaths]]\n[[Category:Frankish Benedictines]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:8th-century Frankish writers]]\n[[Category:8th-century Latin writers]]", "attributes": [{"name": "Catholic Encyclopedia poster", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ambrose Autpert"}]}], "id": 2}]}
