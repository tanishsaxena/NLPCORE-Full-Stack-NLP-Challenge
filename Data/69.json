Self-educated, he became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he left the government to resume his law practice but angered by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]'s opening of the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. He became a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and gained national attention in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against national Democratic leader [[Stephen Douglas]] in the [[1858 and 1859 United States Senate elections|U.S Senate campaign in Illinois]]. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the [[constitutional right]]s of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; [[War Democrats]], who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]], he was shot by [[John Wilkes Booth]], an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day.

The proposal alarmed many Northerners, who hoped to prevent the spread of slavery into the territories. Despite this Northern opposition, Douglas's [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.<ref name=White/>{{rp|188\u2013190}}\n\nFor months after its passage, Lincoln did not publicly comment, but he came to strongly oppose it.<ref name=White/>{{rp|196\u2013197}} On October 16, 1854, in his \"[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]\", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.<ref name=Thomas2008/>{{rp|148\u2013152}} Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a powerful voice,<ref name=White/>{{rp|199}} he said the Kansas Act had a \"''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery.

As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.<ref name=\"White\" />{{rp|216\u2013221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln received significant support to run for vice president, though the party nominated [[William Dayton]] to run with [[John C.

The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]], who had been out of the country serving as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|U.S. representative to Britain]] since 1853 and thus had avoided the slavery debate, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].<ref name=\"White\" />{{rp|224\u2013228}} Buchanan defeated both his challengers.

On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] and began the fight.

He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

He tracked all phases of the effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]].

Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862 midterm elections]], replaced McClellan with [[Ambrose Burnside]].

In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was enacted, which set up court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed this was not within Congress's power, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could be taken only by the Commander-in-Chief, using Constitutional war powers, which he planned to do. Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.<ref name=Donald1996/>{{rp|364\u2013365}}\n\nPrivately, Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy's slave base had to be eliminated. However, Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''New York Tribune'' agreed.<ref name= McPherson1992/>{{rp|124}} Lincoln rejected this argument directly in his letter of August 22, 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his \"official duty\") was that of preserving the Union:<ref name= Guelzo2004/>{{rp|147\u2013153}}\n\n{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.

During the [[Great Depression]], he argues, Lincoln served \"as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful\". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, \"What would Lincoln do?\"<ref name=Schwartz2009/>{{rp|xi, 9, 24}} However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness\".
