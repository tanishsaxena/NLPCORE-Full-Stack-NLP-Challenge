Manutius met Andrea Torresani, who had acquired publishing equipment from [[Nicolas Jenson|Nicholas Jensen]]'s widow. The Aldine Press was originally owned half by Pier Francesco Barbarigo, the nephew of the current doge of the time, [[Agostino Barbarigo]], and the other half by Andrea Torresani. Manutius owned one fifth of Torresani's share. Manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing, leaving financial and operating concerns to Barbarigo and Torresani. In 1496, Aldus established his own location in a building called the ''Thermae'' in the [[San Polo|Sestiere di San Polo]]. The building was later demolished in 1873. Manutius lived and worked in the ''Thermae'' to produce published books from the Aldine Press. This was also the location of the \"New Academy\", where a group of Manutius' friends, associates, and editors came together to translate Greek and Latin texts.<ref name=\"New Aldine Studies\">{{cite book|last1=Fletcher III|first1=Harry George|title=New Aldine Studies|date=1988|publisher=Bernard M.
