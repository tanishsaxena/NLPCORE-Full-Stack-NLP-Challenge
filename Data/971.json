A widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve. A globular protein or a [[random coil]] DNA moves through the interconnected pores, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this sieving process.<ref name=\"zimm\" />\n\nThe Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a [[reptation]] model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a \"snake-like\" fashion (hence \"reptation\") through the pores as an elongated molecule. A biased reptation model applies at higher electric field strength, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction and pulls the rest of the molecule along.<ref name=\"microfluidics\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wyBp-vKbdcC&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Microfluidics for Biological Applications |editor1=Tian, Wei-Cheng |editor2=Finehout, Erin |chapter=Chapter 4 - Genetic Analysis in Miniaturized Electrophoresis Systems |author1=Li Zhu |author2=Hong Wang |page=125 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09480-9 |date=2009-03-02 }}</ref>  Real-time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules, however, showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis, with the DNA showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball, or becoming hooked into a U-shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith SB, Aldridge PK, Callis JB | title = Observation of individual DNA molecules undergoing gel electrophoresis | journal = Science | volume = 243 | issue = 4888 | pages = 203\u20136 | date = January 1989 | pmid = 2911733 | doi = 10.1126/science.2911733 | bibcode = 1989Sci...243..203S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz DC, Koval M | title = Conformational dynamics of individual DNA molecules during gel electrophoresis | journal = Nature | volume = 338 | issue = 6215 | pages = 520\u20132 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2927511 | doi = 10.1038/338520a0 | bibcode = 1989Natur.338..520S }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "G.

The buffers used contain EDTA to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function. The borate in TBE buffer can be problematic as borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity, but it provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product.\n\nMany other buffers have been proposed, e.g. [[LB buffer|lithium borate]] (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Tris-phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if DNA extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM lithium borate).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody JR, Kern SE | title = History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 333 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201313 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15351274 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054 | url = http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121224121719/http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | url-status = dead | archivedate = 24 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOther buffering system may be used in specific applications, for example, barbituric acid-sodium barbiturate or Tris-[[Barbital|barbiturate]] buffers may be used for in agarose gel electrophoresis of proteins, for example in the detection of abnormal distribution of proteins.<ref name=\"jeppson\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeppsson JO, Laurell CB, Franz\u00e9n B | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 629\u201338 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 313856 | url = http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/25/4/629.long }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Gel electrophoresis \u2013 Principles and Basics"}, {"name": "editor", "value": "Sameh Magdeldin"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2012"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "InTech"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-953-51-0458-2"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Brody JR, Kern SE"}, {"name": "title", "value": "History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Analytical Biochemistry"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "333"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "1"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1\u201313"}, {"name": "date", "value": "October 2004"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "15351274"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20121224121719/http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "24 December 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Jeppsson JO, Laurell CB, Franz\u00e9n B"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Agarose gel electrophoresis"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Clinical Chemistry"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "25"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "4"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "629\u201338"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 1979"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "313856"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/25/4/629.long"}]}], "id": 12}, {"title": "Applications", "paragraphs": "*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following digestion with [[restriction enzyme]]s, e.g. in [[restriction map]]ping of cloned DNA.\n*Analysis of products of a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]\n*Separation of DNA fragments for extraction and purification.\n*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].\n*Separation of proteins, for example, screening of protein abnormalities in [[clinical chemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dmbj.org.rs/jmb/pdf/2010-1/2.pdf |title=Agarose gel electrophoresis: Application in Clinical Chemistry |journal=Journal of Medical Biochemistry |doi=10.2478/v10011-009-0033-8 |volume=29|pages= 9\u201314|date= 2010|last1=Giot |first1=Jean-Francois }}</ref>\n\nAgarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.\n\nElectrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://dmbj.org.rs/jmb/pdf/2010-1/2.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Agarose gel electrophoresis: Application in Clinical Chemistry"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Journal of Medical Biochemistry"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.2478/v10011-009-0033-8"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "29"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "9\u201314"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Giot"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Jean-Francois"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": " See also ", "paragraphs": "*[[Gel electrophoresis]]\n*[[Immunodiffusion]], [[Immunoelectrophoresis]]\n*[[SDD-AGE]]\n*[[Northern blot]]\n*[[SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]]\n*[[Southern blot]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 14}, {"title": " References ", "paragraphs": "{{Reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 15}, {"title": " External links ", "paragraphs": "*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050058/http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/biotech/gels/index.html How to run a DNA or RNA gel]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050110/http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/biotech/gels/virgel.html Animation of gel analysis of DNA restriction fragments]\n*[http://www.jove.com/video/3923/agarose-gel-electrophoresis-for-the-separation-of-dna-fragments Video and article of agarose gel electrophoresis]\n*[http://web.mit.edu/7.02/virtual_lab/RDM/RDM1virtuallab.html Step by step photos of running a gel and extracting DNA]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090210181129/http://maradydd.livejournal.com/417631.html Drinking straw electrophoresis!]\n*[http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Agarose_gel_electrophoresis&action=edit&redlink=1 A typical method from wikiversity]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130818003815/http://teach.genetics.utah.edu/content/build_gel_box.pdf Building a gel electrophoresis chamber]\n\n{{Electrophoresis}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agarose Gel Electrophoresis}}\n[[Category:Biological techniques and tools]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Electrophoresis]]\n[[Category:Polymerase chain reaction]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]", "attributes": [], "id": 16}]}
