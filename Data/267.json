As discussed above, the term \"motor neuron disease\" has varying meanings in different countries.

Inherited or genetic MNDs adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns: [[autosomal dominant]], [[Autosomal Recessive|autosomal recessive]], or [[X-linked]]. Some disorders, like ALS, can occur sporadically (85%) or can have a genetic cause (15%) with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nUMNs are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Neuroanatomy through clinical cases|first=Hal |last=Blumenfeld | name-list-format = vanc |date=2002 |publisher=Sinauer |isbn=087893060-4|location=Sunderland, Mass.|oclc=44628054}}</ref> LMNs originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles.<ref name=\":4\" /> Both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle, but damage to an UMN can be distinguished from damage to a LMN by physical exam.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n !
