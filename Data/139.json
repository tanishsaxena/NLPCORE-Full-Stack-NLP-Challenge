Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first human spaceflight from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida.\n\nOriginally planned as the second crewed [[Apollo Lunar Module]] and [[Apollo command and service module|command module]] test, to be flown in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight. Astronaut [[Jim McDivitt]]'s crew, who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit, became the crew for the [[Apollo 9|Apollo{{nbsp}}9]] mission, and Borman's crew were moved to the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission. This left Borman's crew with two to three months' less training and preparation time than originally planned, and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training.\n\nApollo 8 took 68 hours (almost three days) to travel the distance to the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours, during which they made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first ten verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]]. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo{{nbsp}}8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11|Apollo{{nbsp}}11]] to fulfill U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo{{nbsp}}8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern Pacific Ocean. The crew members were named [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s [[Time Person of the Year|\"Men of the Year\"]] for 1968 upon their return.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "pp-move-indef", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "First crewed space mission to orbit the Moon"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2018"}]}, {"name": "Infobox spaceflight\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Apollo 8"}, {"name": "image", "value": "NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "''[[Earthrise]]''<br />taken from Apollo{{nbsp}}8 by [[William Anders]]<ref name=\"NYT-20181221\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20181224a\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20181224b\" />"}, {"name": "image_alt", "value": "A black sky with a grey, cratered lunar horizon.

[[Apollo 4|Apollo{{nbsp}}4]] and [[Apollo 6|Apollo{{nbsp}}6]] were \"A\" missions, tests of the [[Saturn V|Saturn{{nbsp}}V]] launch vehicle using an uncrewed Block I production model of the command and service module (CSM) in Earth orbit. [[Apollo 5|Apollo{{nbsp}}5]] was a \"B\" mission, a test of the LM in Earth orbit. Apollo{{nbsp}}7, scheduled for October 1968, would be a \"C\" mission, a crewed Earth-orbit flight of the CSM. Further missions depended on the readiness of the LM. It had been decided as early as May 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was planned as the \"D\" mission, a test of the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]], and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]], while Borman's crew would fly the \"E\" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo{{nbsp}}9, in early 1969. The \"F\" Mission would test the CSM and LM in lunar orbit, and the \"G\" mission would be the finale, the Moon landing.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=231\u2013234}}\n[[File:Apollo 8 first stage in the Vehicle Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) on February 1, 1968]]\n\nProduction of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo{{nbsp}}8's LM-3 arrived at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered, leading [[Bob Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC), and others to conclude that there was no prospect of LM-3 being ready to fly in 1968.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=256}} Indeed, it was possible that delivery would slip to February or March 1969. Following the original seven-step plan would have meant delaying the \"D\" and subsequent missions, and endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.{{sfn|Ertel|Newkirk|Brooks|1978|pp=237\u2013238}} [[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August 1968 to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the next CSM (designated as \"CSM-103\") would be ready three months before LM-3, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of repeating the \"C\" mission flight of Apollo{{nbsp}}7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to Earth. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until [[Apollo 10|Apollo{{nbsp}}10]], the scheduled \"F\" mission. This also meant that the medium Earth orbit \"E\" mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the \"D\" mission had to be delayed, and the plan for lunar landing in mid-1969 could remain on timeline.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=257}}\n\nOn August 9, 1968, Low discussed the idea with Gilruth, Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]], and the Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Donald Slayton]]. They then flew to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], where they met with KSC Director [[Kurt Debus]], Apollo Program Director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], [[Rocco Petrone]], and [[Wernher von Braun]]. Kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint; Debus and Petrone agreed that the next Saturn V, AS-503, could be made ready by December 1; and von Braun was confident the [[pogo oscillation]] problems that had afflicted Apollo{{nbsp}}6 had been fixed. Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel, along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. Backed by the full support of his agency, Webb authorized the mission. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was officially changed from a \"D\" mission to a \"C-Prime\" lunar-orbit mission.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=257\u2013260}}\n\nWith the change in mission for Apollo 8, Slayton asked McDivitt if he still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what he still wanted to do. Slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the D{{nbsp}}and E{{nbsp}}missions. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104, since CM-104 could not be made ready by December. David Scott was not happy about giving up CM-103, the testing of which he had closely supervised, for CM-104, although the two were almost identical, and Anders was less than enthusiastic about being an LMP on a flight with no LM.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=262}}{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=296\u2013298}} Instead, in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 would carry {{notatypo|a}}<!--LM is pronounced \"LEM\"--> LM test article, a boilerplate model of LM-3.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=257\u2013260}}\n\nAdded pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Zond 5|Zond{{nbsp}}5]] mission, which flew some living creatures, including [[Russian tortoise]]s, in a [[cislunar]] loop around the Moon and returned them to Earth on September 21.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=76}} There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonauts]] on a similar [[Zond program#Circumlunar missions|circumlunar mission]] before the end of 1968.<ref name=\"Moon Race 1968\">{{cite magazine |title=Poised for the Leap |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,844661-1,00.html |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 6, 1968 }}</ref>\n[[File:Mating of Apollo 8 spacecraft with Saturn-V.jpg|thumb|right|Erection and mating of spacecraft 103 to Launch Vehicle AS-503 in the VAB for the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission]]\n\nThe Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], the night before the launch.<ref>{{cite news |title=Astronauts look back 30 years after historic lunar launch |first=Richard |last=Benke |url=http://cgi.canoe.ca/SpaceArchive/981221_30.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Morris Communications]] |date=December 21, 1998 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> They talked about how, before his [[Spirit of St. Louis|1927 flight]], Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight. The total he had carried was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second. The next day, the Lindberghs watched the launch of Apollo{{nbsp}}8 from a nearby dune.{{sfn|Kluger|2017|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\n===Saturn V redesign===\n\nThe Saturn V rocket used by Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was designated AS-503, or the \"03rd\" model of the Saturn{{nbsp}}V (\"5\") Rocket to be used in the Apollo-Saturn (\"AS\") program. When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] command and service module. Apollo{{nbsp}}6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second-stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the Saturn V was ready.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}}\n\nTeams from the MSFC went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}}\n[[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 8 atop Saturn{{nbsp}}V being rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]]]\n\nOf equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it had accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine\u2014a faulty igniter line.

NASA adopted a seven-step plan for Apollo missions, with the final step being a Moon landing. [[Apollo 4|Apollo{{nbsp}}4]] and [[Apollo 6|Apollo{{nbsp}}6]] were \"A\" missions, tests of the [[Saturn V|Saturn{{nbsp}}V]] launch vehicle using an uncrewed Block I production model of the command and service module (CSM) in Earth orbit. [[Apollo 5|Apollo{{nbsp}}5]] was a \"B\" mission, a test of the LM in Earth orbit. Apollo{{nbsp}}7, scheduled for October 1968, would be a \"C\" mission, a crewed Earth-orbit flight of the CSM. Further missions depended on the readiness of the LM. It had been decided as early as May 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was planned as the \"D\" mission, a test of the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]], and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]], while Borman's crew would fly the \"E\" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo{{nbsp}}9, in early 1969. The \"F\" Mission would test the CSM and LM in lunar orbit, and the \"G\" mission would be the finale, the Moon landing.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=231\u2013234}}\n[[File:Apollo 8 first stage in the Vehicle Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) on February 1, 1968]]\n\nProduction of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo{{nbsp}}8's LM-3 arrived at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered, leading [[Bob Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC), and others to conclude that there was no prospect of LM-3 being ready to fly in 1968.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=256}} Indeed, it was possible that delivery would slip to February or March 1969. Following the original seven-step plan would have meant delaying the \"D\" and subsequent missions, and endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.{{sfn|Ertel|Newkirk|Brooks|1978|pp=237\u2013238}} [[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August 1968 to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the next CSM (designated as \"CSM-103\") would be ready three months before LM-3, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of repeating the \"C\" mission flight of Apollo{{nbsp}}7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to Earth. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until [[Apollo 10|Apollo{{nbsp}}10]], the scheduled \"F\" mission. This also meant that the medium Earth orbit \"E\" mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the \"D\" mission had to be delayed, and the plan for lunar landing in mid-1969 could remain on timeline.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=257}}\n\nOn August 9, 1968, Low discussed the idea with Gilruth, Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]], and the Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Donald Slayton]]. They then flew to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], where they met with KSC Director [[Kurt Debus]], Apollo Program Director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], [[Rocco Petrone]], and [[Wernher von Braun]]. Kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint; Debus and Petrone agreed that the next Saturn V, AS-503, could be made ready by December 1; and von Braun was confident the [[pogo oscillation]] problems that had afflicted Apollo{{nbsp}}6 had been fixed. Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel, along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. Backed by the full support of his agency, Webb authorized the mission. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was officially changed from a \"D\" mission to a \"C-Prime\" lunar-orbit mission.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=257\u2013260}}\n\nWith the change in mission for Apollo 8, Slayton asked McDivitt if he still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what he still wanted to do. Slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the D{{nbsp}}and E{{nbsp}}missions. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104, since CM-104 could not be made ready by December. David Scott was not happy about giving up CM-103, the testing of which he had closely supervised, for CM-104, although the two were almost identical, and Anders was less than enthusiastic about being an LMP on a flight with no LM.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=262}}{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=296\u2013298}} Instead, in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 would carry {{notatypo|a}}<!--LM is pronounced \"LEM\"--> LM test article, a boilerplate model of LM-3.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=257\u2013260}}\n\nAdded pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Zond 5|Zond{{nbsp}}5]] mission, which flew some living creatures, including [[Russian tortoise]]s, in a [[cislunar]] loop around the Moon and returned them to Earth on September 21.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=76}} There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonauts]] on a similar [[Zond program#Circumlunar missions|circumlunar mission]] before the end of 1968.<ref name=\"Moon Race 1968\">{{cite magazine |title=Poised for the Leap |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,844661-1,00.html |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 6, 1968 }}</ref>\n[[File:Mating of Apollo 8 spacecraft with Saturn-V.jpg|thumb|right|Erection and mating of spacecraft 103 to Launch Vehicle AS-503 in the VAB for the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission]]\n\nThe Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], the night before the launch.<ref>{{cite news |title=Astronauts look back 30 years after historic lunar launch |first=Richard |last=Benke |url=http://cgi.canoe.ca/SpaceArchive/981221_30.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Morris Communications]] |date=December 21, 1998 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> They talked about how, before his [[Spirit of St. Louis|1927 flight]], Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight.

When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] command and service module. Apollo{{nbsp}}6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second-stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the Saturn V was ready.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}}\n\nTeams from the MSFC went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}}\n[[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 8 atop Saturn{{nbsp}}V being rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]]]\n\nOf equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it had accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine\u2014a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}}\n\nThe teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the MSFC.

The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it\u2014this marked the first time humans had viewed the whole Earth at once. Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the CSM and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the small [[Apollo CSM#Reaction control system|reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters on the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) to add {{convert|1.1|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} to their velocity away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in the Earth direction to increase speed, but at {{convert|7.7|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} instead.

Although Mission Control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to Earth in case communication with Mission Control was lost. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]].

The crew had been awake for more than 16 hours. Before launch, NASA had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises. Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|service propulsion system]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was \"coated\" first by burning the engine for a short period. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about {{convert|20.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} velocity [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel).{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=35}} This change was less than the planned {{convert|24.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}, because of a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[nitrogen tetroxide|oxidizer]] lines, which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled because the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 trajectory was found to be perfect.<ref name=\"journal day 1 Maroon\"/>\n\nAbout an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman obtained permission from [[flight controller|ground control]] to take a [[Secobarbital|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]]. The pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep, and then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces, which the crew cleaned up as well as they could. Borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they asked Mission Control to check the recording, stating that they \"would like an evaluation of the voice comments\".<ref name=\"journal day 2 green\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/06day2_green.htm |title=Day 2: Green Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch. The Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew used a {{convert|2|kg|lb|adj=on}} camera that broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. The camera had two [[lens (optics)|lenses]], a very [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle (160\u00b0) lens]], and a [[telephoto lens|telephoto (9\u00b0) lens]].{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}}<ref name=\"journal day 2 Maroon\">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov:80/ap08fj/07day2_maroon.htm |title=Day 1: Maroon Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, without proper [[Optical filter|filters]], the Earth image became saturated by any bright source. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}} After broadcasting for 17 minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[high-gain antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.<ref name=\"journal day 2 Maroon\" />\n\nBy this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32 and a half hours into the flight\u20143 and a half hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.<ref name=\"journal day 2 Maroon\" /> The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and the [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] required for passive thermal control. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=277}}\n\nApollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth, what was visible, and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23 minutes.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}}\n\n===Lunar sphere of influence===\n\n[[File:Apollo 8 Picture of the Moon (AS08-14-2506).jpg|thumb|left|This photograph of the Moon was taken from Apollo{{nbsp}}8 at a point above 70 degrees east longitude.]]\n\nAt about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight, and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo{{nbsp}}8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body. In other words, the effect of the Moon's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational force]] on Apollo{{nbsp}}8 became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was {{convert|38759|mi|km}} from the Moon and had a speed of {{convert|3990|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} relative to the Moon. This historic moment was of little interest to the crew, since they were still calculating their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}}\n\nThe last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) was a second mid-course correction. It was in [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] (against the direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by {{convert|2.0|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, effectively reducing the closest distance at which the spacecraft would pass the Moon. At exactly 61 hours after launch, about {{convert|24200|mi|km}} from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds. They would now pass {{convert|71.7|mi|km}} from the [[Geology of the Moon#Lunar landscape|lunar surface]].{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=46}}\n\nAt 64 hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion{{nbsp}}1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a \"[[Launch status check|go/no go]]\" decision, the crew was told at 68 hours that they were Go and \"riding the best bird we can find\".<ref name=\"journal day 3 LOI\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/11day3_black_approach.htm |title=Day 3: The Black Team\u2014Approaching the Moon |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar orbit or even been flung off into space. If it had lasted too long, they could have struck the Moon.

Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status. Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night's sleep in over three days. He ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. Anders initially protested, saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. Anders finally agreed under the condition that Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching, he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits, Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm.<ref name=\"journal day 4-456\"/>{{sfn|Kluger|2017|pp=240\u2013241}}\n\nAs they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the astronauts began the second television transmission. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being \"a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing\".{{sfn|De Groot|2006|p=229}} Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] from the [[Book of Genesis]]. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, \"And from the crew of Apollo{{nbsp}}8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you\u2014all of you on the good Earth.\"<ref name=\"moonport\">{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Charles D. |last2=Faherty |first2=William Barnaby |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123133438/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |year=1978 |publisher=NASA |id=NASA SP-4204 |chapter=Apollo 8\u2014A Christmas Gift |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch20-9.html |url-status=live}} Ch.20-9.</ref>\n\nThe only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the [[trans-Earth injection]] (TEI), which was scheduled for {{frac|2|1|2}} hours after the end of the television transmission. The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.{{sfn|Kluger|2017|pp=250\u2013252}} The burn occurred exactly on time.

The crew placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also called \"barbecue roll\", in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, parts of the spacecraft's outer surface could be heated to over {{convert|200|C|F}}, while the parts in shadow would be {{convert|-100|C|F}}. These temperatures could cause the [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|heat shield]] to crack and propellant lines to burst. Because it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. The crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.<ref name=\"journal day 1 Maroon\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/04day1_maroon.htm |title=Day 1: Maroon Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The crew had been awake for more than 16 hours. Before launch, NASA had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises. Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|service propulsion system]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was \"coated\" first by burning the engine for a short period. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about {{convert|20.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} velocity [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel).{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=35}} This change was less than the planned {{convert|24.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}, because of a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[nitrogen tetroxide|oxidizer]] lines, which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled because the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 trajectory was found to be perfect.<ref name=\"journal day 1 Maroon\"/>\n\nAbout an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman obtained permission from [[flight controller|ground control]] to take a [[Secobarbital|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]]. The pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep, and then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces, which the crew cleaned up as well as they could. Borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they asked Mission Control to check the recording, stating that they \"would like an evaluation of the voice comments\".<ref name=\"journal day 2 green\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/06day2_green.htm |title=Day 2: Green Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch. The Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew used a {{convert|2|kg|lb|adj=on}} camera that broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. The camera had two [[lens (optics)|lenses]], a very [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle (160\u00b0) lens]], and a [[telephoto lens|telephoto (9\u00b0) lens]].{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}}<ref name=\"journal day 2 Maroon\">{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov:80/ap08fj/07day2_maroon.htm |title=Day 1: Maroon Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, without proper [[Optical filter|filters]], the Earth image became saturated by any bright source. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}} After broadcasting for 17 minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[high-gain antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.<ref name=\"journal day 2 Maroon\" />\n\nBy this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32 and a half hours into the flight\u20143 and a half hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.<ref name=\"journal day 2 Maroon\" /> The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and the [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] required for passive thermal control. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=277}}\n\nApollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth, what was visible, and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23 minutes.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=36}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://history.nasa.gov:80/ap08fj/03day1_green_sep.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Day 1: Green Team"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Woods"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "W.

One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that was planned as the Apollo{{nbsp}}11 landing site. The launch time of Apollo{{nbsp}}8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest. By the end of the mission, the crew had taken over eight hundred 70&nbsp;mm still photographs and {{convert|700|ft}} of 16&nbsp;mm movie film.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=37}}\n\nThroughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a \"go/no go\" decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.<ref name=\"journal day 4-123\" />\n\nAs they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over.

During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] near [[Seabrook, Texas]], but due to the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 flight, he was unable to attend. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer, which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.<ref name=\"journal day 4-123\" />\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1968-118A"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo 8"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[National Space Science Data Center]]"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "NASA"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "June 28, 2013"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "193.3"}, {"name": "2", "value": "by"}, {"name": "3", "value": "69.5"}, {"name": "4", "value": "mi"}, {"name": "5", "value": "km"}, {"name": "adj", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "The Moon is essentially grey, no color; looks like [[plaster of Paris]] or sort of a grayish beach sand.

Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status. Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night's sleep in over three days. He ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. Anders initially protested, saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. Anders finally agreed under the condition that Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching, he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits, Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm.<ref name=\"journal day 4-456\"/>{{sfn|Kluger|2017|pp=240\u2013241}}\n\nAs they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the astronauts began the second television transmission.

Borman described it as being \"a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing\".{{sfn|De Groot|2006|p=229}} Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] from the [[Book of Genesis]]. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit.
