Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: \"A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout]].\"<ref name=\"gutenberg\" />\n\nSwift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential [[William Petty]] and the [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of \"a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London\" and \"the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]\" (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706).\n\nIn the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by [[paralipsis]]:\n{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.\n\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants.

The pamphlet targets reformers who \"regard people as commodities\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p101\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 101</ref> In the piece, Swift adopts the \"technique of a political arithmetician\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 95</ref> to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.\n\nCritics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically \"the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\"/> Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that \"springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p98\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 98</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "Rhetoric", "paragraphs": "Charles K.

You know women in passion never mind what they say; but, as she is a very reasonable woman, I have almost brought her over now to your opinion; and having convinced her, that as matters stood, we could not possibly maintain all the nine, she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest: and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal; for, if he should happen to get twins, the selling of one might provide for the other. Or if, by any accident, while his wife lies in with one child, he should get a second upon the body of another woman, he might dispose of the fattest of the two, and that would help to breed up the other.</blockquote><blockquote>The more I think upon this scheme, the more reasonable it appears to me; and it ought by no means to be confined to Ireland; for, in all probability, we shall, in a very little time, be altogether as poor here as you are there.

It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.\n\nThe essay's approach has been copied many times. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), the evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and [[euthanasia]], imagining a future [[dystopia]] that advocates [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]], [[fetuses]], and some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the US [[pro-life]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as [[disability discrimination]].) In his book ''A Modest Proposal for America'' (2013), statistician [[Howard Friedman]] opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.\n\nIn the 1998 edition of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] there is a quote from ''A Modest Proposal'' before the introduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Handmaid's Tale|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref>\n\n''A Modest Video Game Proposal'' is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] on 10 October 2005. He proposed that someone should \"create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game\" that would allow players to act out a scenario in which the game character kills video game developers.<sup>[[A Modest Video Game Proposal#cite note-ModestProposal-1|[1]]]</sup>\n\n[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in America|Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist]]'' includes a letter in which he uses Swift's approach in connection with the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he is going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. The letter protests against the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.\n\nThe 2012 film ''Butcher Boys,'' written by [[Kim Henkel]], is said{{By whom|date=April 2018}} to be loosely based on Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal.'' The film's opening scene takes place in a restaurant named \"J. Swift's\".\n\nOn November 30, 2017, Jonathan Swift's 350th birthday, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a column entitled 'Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies\", by [[Alexandra Petri]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/11/30/why-alabamians-should-consider-eating-democrat-babies/|last=Petri|first=Alexandra|title=Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies|work=The Washington Post|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, [[E.
