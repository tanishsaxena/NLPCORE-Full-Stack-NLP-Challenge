A common aspect of ambiguity is [[uncertainty]]. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose [[intention|intended]] meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The ''[[wikt:ambi-#Prefix|ambi]]-'' part of the [[Terminology|term]] reflects an idea of \"[[2 (number)|two]]\", as in \"two meanings\".)\n\nThe concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.\n\nContext may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Type of uncertainty of meaning in which several interpretations are plausible"}]}, {"name": "redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ambiguous"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the film"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Ambiguous (film)"}]}, {"name": "Multiple issues", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{More footnotes|date=September 2017}}\n{{tone|date=September 2017}}"}]}, {"name": "More footnotes", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2017"}]}, {"name": "tone", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2017"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " Linguistic forms ", "paragraphs": "Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with [[Semantics|semantic]] ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful [[context (language use)|context]]-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].\n\nLinguistic ambiguity [[Ambiguity (law)|can be a problem in law]], because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.[[File:Structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence.svg|thumb|Structural analysis of an ambiguous Spanish sentence:<br /> '''Pepe vio a Pablo enfurecido'''<br />Interpretation 1: When Pepe was angry, then he saw Pablo<br />Interpretation 2: Pepe saw that Pablo was angry.<br />Here, the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2.]]\n\n===Lexical ambiguity===\nThe [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs.<ref name=\"SmallCottrell2013\">{{cite book|author1=Steven L.

For instance, the word \"bank\" has several distinct lexical definitions, including \"[[Bank|financial institution]]\" and \"[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]\". Or consider  \"[[apothecary]]\". One could say \"I bought herbs from the apothecary\". This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).\n\nThe context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says \"I buried $100 in the bank\", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.\n\nLexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[word sense disambiguation]].\n\nThe use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose \"[[weasel word]]s\" and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Electoral district|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].\n\nMore problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. \"Good\", for example, can mean \"useful\" or \"functional\" (''That's a good hammer''), \"exemplary\" (''She's a good student''), \"pleasing\" (''This is good soup''), \"moral\" (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), \"[[righteous]]\", etc. \" I have a good daughter\" is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity (\"unlockable\" can mean \"capable of being unlocked\" or \"impossible to lock\").\n\n===Semantic and syntactic ambiguity===\n\n[[Semantic ambiguity]] occurs when a word, phrase or sentence, taken out of context, has more than one interpretation.   In \"We saw her duck\" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the words \"her duck\" can refer either\n\n# to the person's bird (the noun \"duck\", modified by the possessive pronoun \"her\"), or\n# to a motion she made (the verb \"duck\", the subject of which is the objective pronoun \"her\", object of the verb \"saw\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence\u2014its syntax.  This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. \"He ate the cookies on the couch\", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.  \"To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license.\"  This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.  Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher.  Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Critical Thinking, 10th ed., Ch 3, Moore, Brooke N. and Parker, Richard.  McGraw-Hill, 2012</ref>\nFor the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, [[formal languages]] (such as computer [[programming language]]s), see [[Ambiguous grammar]].\n\nUsually, semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand. The sentence \"We saw her duck\" is also syntactically ambiguous. Conversely, a sentence like \"He ate the cookies on the couch\" is also semantically ambiguous. Rarely, but occasionally, the different parsings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning. For example, the command \"Cook, cook!\" can be parsed as \"Cook (noun used as vocative), cook (imperative verb form)!\", but also as \"Cook (imperative verb form), cook (noun used as vocative)!\". It is more common that a syntactically unambiguous phrase has a semantic ambiguity; for example, the lexical ambiguity in \"Your boss is a funny man\" is purely semantic, leading to the response \"Funny ha-ha or funny peculiar?\"\n\n[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, \"ice cream\" and \"I scream\". Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].\n\n[[Metonymy]] involves referring to one entity by the name of a different but closely related entity (for example, using \"wheels\" to refer to a car, or \"Wall Street\" to refer to the stock exchanges located on that street or even the entire US financial sector). In the modern vocabulary of critical semiotics, metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as \"sweet ride\" to refer to a nice car.

For example, a politician might say, \"I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth\", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after \"taxes\" (to convey the first sense) or by changing \"which\" to \"that\" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true \u2013 an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.\n\nIn [[continental philosophy]] (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. [[Martin Heidegger]] argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an \"essay in phenomenological ontology\" [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: \"as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.\" Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: \"Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting\". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 4}, {"title": "Literature and rhetoric", "paragraphs": "In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool.  Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: \"Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know\".  Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" (where \"blue\" can refer to the color, or to sadness).\n\nIn the narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''The Great Gatsby''.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5}, {"title": " Mathematical notation ", "paragraphs": "[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.\n\n=== Names of functions ===\nThe '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:\n* [[Sinc function]]\n* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the third kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List of notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.\n* [[Exponential integral]]<ref name=\"irene\">{{cite book|url=http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm|title=Handbook on mathematical functions|last1=Abramovits|first1=M.|last2=Stegun|first2=I.|page=228}}</ref>\n* [[Hermite polynomial]]<ref name=\"irene\" />{{rp|775}}\n\n=== Expressions ===\nAmbiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.\nIt is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, <math>f=f(x)</math>. Then, if one sees <math>f=f(y+1)</math>, there is no way to distinguish whether it means <math>f=f(x)</math> '''multiplied''' by <math>(y+1)</math>, or function <math>f</math> '''evaluated''' at argument equal to <math>(y+1)</math>. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.\n\nCreators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The [[Wolfram Language]] used in [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.\n\nThe order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, <math>a/bc</math> is interpreted as <math>a/(bc)</math>; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.\nIn the [[scientific journal]] style, one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions, whereas variables are written using italics.\nFor example, in mathematical journals the expression\n<math> s i n</math>\ndoes not denote the [[sine function]], but the\nproduct of the three variables\n<math>s</math>,\n<math>i</math>,\n<math>n</math>, although in the informal notation of a slide presentation it may stand for <math>\\sin</math>.\n\nCommas in multi-component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted; this is also potentially ambiguous notation.\nFor example, in the notation <math>T_{mnk}</math>, the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single-index object, taken with the subscript equal to product of variables <math>m</math>, <math>n</math> and <math>k</math>, or it is an indication to a trivalent [[tensor]].\n\n=== Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===\nAn expression such as <math>\\sin^2\\alpha/2</math> can be understood to mean either <math>(\\sin(\\alpha/2))^2</math> or <math>(\\sin \\alpha)^2/2</math>. Often the author's intention can be understood from the context, in cases where only one of the two makes sense, but an ambiguity like this should be avoided, for example by writing <math>\\sin^2(\\alpha/2)</math> or <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\alpha</math>.\n\nThe expression <math>\\sin^{-1}\\alpha</math> means <math>\\arcsin(\\alpha)</math> in several texts, though it might be thought to mean <math>(\\sin \\alpha)^{-1}</math>, since <math>\\sin^{n} \\alpha</math> commonly means <math>(\\sin \\alpha)^{n}</math>. Conversely, <math>\\sin^2 \\alpha</math> might seem to mean <math>\\sin(\\sin \\alpha)</math>, as this [[exponentiation]] notation usually denotes [[function iteration]]: in general, <math>f^2(x)</math> means <math>f(f(x))</math>. However, for [[trigonometric]] and [[hyperbolic functions]], this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application.\n\nThe expression <math>a/2b</math> can be interpreted as meaning <math>(a/2)b</math>, in particular if one thinks that the common acronym ''[[PEMDAS]]'' for the order of operations implies that M(ultiplication) takes precedence over D(ivision); however, it is more commonly understood to mean <math>a/(2b)</math>.\n\n=== Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics ===\nIt is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with <math>~|\\alpha\\rangle~ </math> and states with fixed number of photons with <math>~|n\\rangle~</math>. Then, there is an \"unwritten rule\": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and <math>~n~</math>photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if <math>~|x\\rangle~</math> is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and <math>~|p\\rangle~</math> means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression <math> |1\\rangle </math> may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.\n\n=== Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics ===\nSome physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: \"... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|last=Wittgenstein|first=Ludwig|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|year=1999|isbn=978-0-486-40445-5|page=39}}</ref>\n\nA highly confusing term is ''gain''. For example, the sentence \"the gain of a system should be doubled\", without context, means close to nothing.\n\n* It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.\n* It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.\n* It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).\n\nThe term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.\n\nAlso, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also [[Accuracy and precision]] and its talk.\n\nThe [[Berry paradox]] arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as \"definable\" or \"nameable\". Terms of this kind give rise to [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] fallacies.

Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, <math>f=f(x)</math>. Then, if one sees <math>f=f(y+1)</math>, there is no way to distinguish whether it means <math>f=f(x)</math> '''multiplied''' by <math>(y+1)</math>, or function <math>f</math> '''evaluated''' at argument equal to <math>(y+1)</math>. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.\n\nCreators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The [[Wolfram Language]] used in [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.\n\nThe order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, <math>a/bc</math> is interpreted as <math>a/(bc)</math>; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.\nIn the [[scientific journal]] style, one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions, whereas variables are written using italics.\nFor example, in mathematical journals the expression\n<math> s i n</math>\ndoes not denote the [[sine function]], but the\nproduct of the three variables\n<math>s</math>,\n<math>i</math>,\n<math>n</math>, although in the informal notation of a slide presentation it may stand for <math>\\sin</math>.\n\nCommas in multi-component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted; this is also potentially ambiguous notation.\nFor example, in the notation <math>T_{mnk}</math>, the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single-index object, taken with the subscript equal to product of variables <math>m</math>, <math>n</math> and <math>k</math>, or it is an indication to a trivalent [[tensor]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 8}, {"title": " Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ", "paragraphs": "An expression such as <math>\\sin^2\\alpha/2</math> can be understood to mean either <math>(\\sin(\\alpha/2))^2</math> or <math>(\\sin \\alpha)^2/2</math>.

Conversely, <math>\\sin^2 \\alpha</math> might seem to mean <math>\\sin(\\sin \\alpha)</math>, as this [[exponentiation]] notation usually denotes [[function iteration]]: in general, <math>f^2(x)</math> means <math>f(f(x))</math>. However, for [[trigonometric]] and [[hyperbolic functions]], this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application.\n\nThe expression <math>a/2b</math> can be interpreted as meaning <math>(a/2)b</math>, in particular if one thinks that the common acronym ''[[PEMDAS]]'' for the order of operations implies that M(ultiplication) takes precedence over D(ivision); however, it is more commonly understood to mean <math>a/(2b)</math>.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": " Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics ", "paragraphs": "It is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with <math>~|\\alpha\\rangle~ </math> and states with fixed number of photons with <math>~|n\\rangle~</math>.

Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used.

For example, the sentence \"the gain of a system should be doubled\", without context, means close to nothing.\n\n* It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.\n* It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.\n* It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).\n\nThe term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.\n\nAlso, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise.
