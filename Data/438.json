A person who plays the accordion is called an ''accordionist''.  The [[concertina]] and [[Bandoneon|bandone\u00f3n]] are related; the [[harmonium]] and [[American reed organ]] are in the same family.\n\nThe instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing ''pallets'' to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]''. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.<ref group=\"notes\">For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''</ref>  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.\n\nThe accordion is widely spread across the world.

The pitch also depends on its size.\n* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.\n* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.\n* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual.\n* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]].\n* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as how an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might voice a particular instrument or tune [[Voix c\u00e9leste|celeste]] ranks.\n\n===Universal components===\n====Bellows====\n{{Listen\n|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg\n|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds\n|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows\u2014949&nbsp;KB\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Squeeze boxes accordion bandoneon concertina diatonic chromatic.jpg|thumb|265px|'''Bellows-Driven Instruments'''\n<br>\nPiano accordions\uff65\uff65\uff651,2,13<br>\nDiatonic button accordion\uff65\uff65\uff653<br>\nChromatic button accordions\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,14<br>\nDigital accordions(V-Accordions, [[Roland Corporation]])\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,13,14<br>\n[[Bandoneon]]\uff65\uff65\uff654<br>\n[[English concertina]]\uff65\uff65\uff655<br>\n[[Anglo concertina|Anglo-German concertinas]](Anglo concertinas)\uff65\uff65\uff656,7,8,9,10]]\nThe [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibrations, applied pressure increases the volume.\n\nThe keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows.

These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May\u2013June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n====Pallet mechanism====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende b\u00e6lgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>\n\n[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.|alt=Accordion; cross-sectional view]]\n\n===Variable components===\nThe term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in several musical traditions, including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.\n\n====Right-hand manual systems====\n[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody. Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7\u20139 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].\n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows\n* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A ''Weltmeister'' piano accordion by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Left-hand manual systems====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for [[chord (music)|chords]].\n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n====Reed ranks and switches====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.\n\n====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====\nIn describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n====Straps====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n====Electronic and digital====\n{{Main|Digital accordion}}\n[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n===Unusual accordions===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.

They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7\u20139 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].\n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows\n* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A ''Weltmeister'' piano accordion by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Left-hand manual systems====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for [[chord (music)|chords]].\n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n====Reed ranks and switches====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.\n\n====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====\nIn describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n====Straps====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n====Electronic and digital====\n{{Main|Digital accordion}}\n[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Dan Lindgren"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "18 March 2009"}]}, {"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Accordion reed ranks and switches"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Digital accordion"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Right-hand manual systems", "paragraphs": "[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody.

After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 10}, {"title": "Straps", "paragraphs": "The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.

The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Digital accordion"}]}], "id": 12}, {"title": "Unusual accordions", "paragraphs": "[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.

An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 \u2013 19 Jun 09 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l\u00e4\u00dft sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da\u00df man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T\u00f6ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu\u00df ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, w\u00fcrde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"\nTranslation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A-Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : \u201cGREAT CONCERT-ROOM \u2013 KING\u2019S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called \u201ca concertina,\u201d an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': \u201cWhile we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>\n\nAfter Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph M\u00fcller's accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M\u00fcller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule f\u00fcr Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Free reed aerophone#History"}, {"name": "l1", "value": "History of free reed aerophones"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Campacci"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Claudio"}, {"name": "title", "value": "S\u00e9culo Xix"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Clube de Autores]]"}, {"name": "page", "value": "14"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=_VtPBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=Christian+Friedrich+Ludwig+Buschmann+1822#v=onepage&q=Christian%20Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Buschmann%201822&f=false"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "15 January 2017"}, {"name": "language", "value": "pt"}, {"name": "date", "value": "30 May 2008"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-87-7289-466-9"}]}, {"name": "ISSN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0900-2111"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Banin"}, {"name": "first", "value": "A.A."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Russkaia instrumentalnaia muzyka folklornoi traditsii"}, {"name": "language", "value": "Russian"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Moscow"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "page", "value": "144"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm"}, {"name": "date", "value": "18 July 2011"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": "Use in various music genres", "paragraphs": "{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n===Use in traditional music===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nThe accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world.

Yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child.<ref name=\"GraffDurchholz2012\">{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel|title=Rock 'n' Roll Myths: The True Stories Behind the Most Infamous Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWlSUYbiUXUC&pg=PT152|year=2012|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61058-571-2|page=152}}</ref>\n\nThe accordion has also been used in the rock genre, most notably by [[John Linnell]] of [[They Might Be Giants]], featuring more prominently in the band's earlier works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tmbw.net/wiki/Accordion|title=Accordion \u2013 TMBW: The They Might Be Giants Knowledge Base|website=tmbw.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}</ref> The instrument is still frequently used during live performances, and continues to make appearances in their studio albums. Accordion is also used in the music of the [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Gogol Bordello]].\n\nAccordionists in [[heavy metal music]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances. The Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] used to have a full-time accordionist, employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist. One of their accordionists, Netta Skog, is now a member of [[Ensiferum]], another folk-metal band. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death-folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] accordion known as a ''zuger\u00f6rgeli''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Use in classical music===\n{{Main|Accordion music genres#Use in classical music|l1=Accordion in classical music}}\n\nAlthough best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is ''{{lang|fr|Th\u00eame vari\u00e9 tr\u00e8s brillant pour accord\u00e9on methode Reisner}}'', written in 1836 by Louise Reisner of Paris. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]], wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.\n\nThe first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].<ref>[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm ''Accordion Composers in German''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107190534/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm |date=7 November 2007 }} Accordion Online</ref> In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', Op. 7. In 1937 the first [[accordion concerto]] was composed in Russia. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Henry Doktorski, \"The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,\" The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.

The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. In his work ''Drang'' (1999), British composer [http://www.johnpalmer.org John Palmer]  pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion/bayan. [[Luciano Berio]] wrote ''Sequenza XIII'' (1995) for accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universaledition.com/composers-and-works/luciano-berio-54/works/sequenza-xiii-4612|title=Luciano Berio: Sequenza XIII|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Accordionists like [[Mogens Ellegaard]], [[Joseph Macerollo]], [[Friedrich Lips]], [[Hugo Noth]], [[Stefan Hussong]], [[Italo Salizzato]], [[Teodoro Anzellotti]], [[Mie Miki]], and [[Geir Draugsvoll]], encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion (solo and chamber music) and also started playing baroque music on the free bass accordion.\n\nFrench composer [[Henri Dutilleux]] used an accordion in both his late song cycles ''Correspondances'' (2003) and ''[[Le Temps l'horloge|Le Temps l'Horloge]]'' (2009).  Russian-born composer [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] has composed solos, concertos, and chamber works for accordion. Astor Piazzolla's concert tangos are performed widely.

In some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil. Outside the south, the accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forr\u00f3]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[bai\u00e3o (music)|Bai\u00e3o]]) as the principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the \"King of the [[bai\u00e3o (music)|Bai\u00e3o]]\") and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style from the northeast.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum). This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the southeast of the country (in the Forr\u00f3 Universit\u00e1rio genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada). Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music. It is an important instrument in [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the midwest and southeast of Brazil, and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country.\n\n===Colombia===\nThe accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia, commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres.

In some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil. Outside the south, the accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forr\u00f3]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[bai\u00e3o (music)|Bai\u00e3o]]) as the principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the \"King of the [[bai\u00e3o (music)|Bai\u00e3o]]\") and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style from the northeast.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum). This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the southeast of the country (in the Forr\u00f3 Universit\u00e1rio genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada). Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music. It is an important instrument in [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the midwest and southeast of Brazil, and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://ciadoacordeon.com.br/cia-do-acordeon-historia.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Cia do Acordeon \u2013 Hist\u00f3ria do Acordeon"}, {"name": "website", "value": "ciadoacordeon.com.br"}, {"name": "language", "value": "pt"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-11-01"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www2.al.rs.gov.br/dal/Sess%C3%A3oPlen%C3%A1ria/DetalheVotacao/tabid/5627/Default.aspx?idProjeto=6484"}, {"name": "title", "value": "DetalheVotacao"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Legislativo"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Departamento de Assessoramento"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www2.al.rs.gov.br"}, {"name": "language", "value": "pt-BR"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-11-01"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.acordeom.com.br/menu/not2.php?id=1"}, {"name": "title", "value": "noticias"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.acordeom.com.br"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-11-01"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.lojamanomonteiro.com.br/interna.php?cod=17770"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Todeschini a Hist\u00f3ria"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.lojamanomonteiro.com.br"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-11-01"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://ciadoacordeon.com.br/cia-do-acordeon-historia.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Cia do Acordeon \u2013 Hist\u00f3ria do Acordeon"}, {"name": "website", "value": "ciadoacordeon.com.br"}, {"name": "language", "value": "pt"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-11-01"}]}], "id": 22}, {"title": "Colombia", "paragraphs": "The accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia, commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres.
