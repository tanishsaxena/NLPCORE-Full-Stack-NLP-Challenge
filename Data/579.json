Amethyste prayed to the gods to remain chaste, a prayer which the chaste goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] answered, transforming her into a white stone.

The mortal turned out to be a beautiful young woman, Amethystos, who was on her way to pay tribute to [[Artemis]]. Her life was spared by Artemis, who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws. Dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue.
