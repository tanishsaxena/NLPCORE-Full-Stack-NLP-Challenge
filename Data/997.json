It is a [[Latin]] transliteration from the [[koine Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd|\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd]]}} (''ho aion''), from the archaic {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03dd\u03ce\u03bd}}  (''aiwon''). In [[Homer]] it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[olam (disambiguation)|olam]]''. A [[cognate]] [[Latin language|Latin]]  word ''aevum'' or ''aeuum'' (cf. {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03dd\u03ce\u03bd}}) for \"age\" is present in words such as ''longevity'' and ''mediaeval''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pballew.net/arithm16.html|title=Math words page 16|access-date=2006-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618055137/http://pballew.net/arithm16.html|archive-date=2010-06-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term aeon may be used in reference to a period of a billion years (especially in [[geology]], [[cosmology]] or [[astronomy]]), its more common usage is for any long, indefinite period.

After each man's mortal life ends, he is judged worthy of aeonian life or aeonian punishment. That is, after the period of the aeons, all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then God becomes the all in each one ({{bibleref2|1Cor|15:28|NKJV}}).

Evolution itself is taken to result from a certain specific process \u2013 and this process can be described, or explained [or 're-presented' ] via a bifurcation of time. That is, evolution is an expression of how the cosmos changes over or through or because of,'time' \u2013 this 'time' having two components. These two components are the causal and the acausal ...\n\n\"An aeon is a manifestation, in the causal, of a particular type of acausal energy. This energy re-orders, or changes, the causal. These changes have certain limits \u2013 in both causal space and causal time. That is, they have a specific beginning and a specific end. A civilization (or rather, a higher or aeonic-civilization) is how this energy becomes ordered or manifests itself in the causal: how this energy is revealed. A civilization represents the practical changes which this energy causes in the causal -in terms of the effect such energy has on individuals and this planet. A civilization is tied to, is born from, a particular aeon.
