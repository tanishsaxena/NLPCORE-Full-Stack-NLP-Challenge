The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nAccidental ignition of damaged wire insulation inside the oxygen tank as it was being routinely stirred caused an explosion that vented the tank's contents. Without oxygen, needed both for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] by television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "about", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the 1970 spaceflight"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the film based upon it"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Apollo 13 (film){{!}}''Apollo 13'' (film)"}, {"name": "5", "value": "Apollo 13 (disambiguation)"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "A failed crewed mission to land on the Moon"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2014"}]}, {"name": "Infobox spaceflight\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Apollo 13"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Apollo 13 Service Module - AS13-59-8500 (cropped).jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "Apollo 13's damaged service module, seen from the command module, as it was being jettisoned shortly before reentry"}, {"name": "image_alt", "value": "see caption"}, {"name": "insignia", "value": "Apollo 13-insignia.png"}, {"name": "insignia_alt", "value": "Apollo 13 logo"}, {"name": "mission_type", "value": "Crewed lunar landing attempt ([[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|H]])"}, {"name": "operator", "value": "[[NASA]]"}, {"name": "COSPAR_ID", "value": "1970-029A"}, {"name": "SATCAT", "value": "4371<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=4371|title=Apollo 13 CM|website=N2YO.com|access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref>"}, {"name": "mission_duration", "value": "5&nbsp;days, 22&nbsp;hours, 54&nbsp;minutes, 41&nbsp;seconds{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=309}}"}, {"name": "spacecraft", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |[[Apollo command and service module|Apollo CSM]]-109\n  |[[Apollo lunar module|Apollo LM]]-7\n}}"}, {"name": "manufacturer", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |CSM: [[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]]\n  |LM: [[Grumman]]\n}}"}, {"name": "launch_mass", "value": "{{convert|101261|lb|kg|order=flip}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=284}}"}, {"name": "landing_mass", "value": "{{convert|11133|lb|kg|order=flip}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=307}}"}, {"name": "launch_date", "value": "{{start-date|April 11, 1970, 19:13:00|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC"}, {"name": "launch_rocket", "value": "[[Saturn V]] SA-508"}, {"name": "launch_site", "value": "[[Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy]] [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39A]]"}, {"name": "landing_date", "value": "{{end-date|April 17, 1970, 18:07:41|timezone=yes}}&nbsp;UTC"}, {"name": "landing_site", "value": "South Pacific Ocean<br/>{{Coord|21|38|24|S|165|21|42|W|type:event|name=Apollo 13 splashdown}}"}, {"name": "recovery_by", "value": "{{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}}"}, {"name": "apsis", "value": "gee\n\n {{Infobox spaceflight/IP\n   |type                = flyby\n   |note                = orbit and landing aborted\n   |object              = Moon\n   |distance            = {{convert|137|nmi|km|order=flip|sp=us}}\n   |arrival_date        = April 15, 1970, 00:21:00&nbsp;UTC\n }}"}, {"name": "docking", "value": "{{Infobox spaceflight/Dock\n   | docking_target     = LM\n   | docking_type       = dock\n   | docking_date       = April 11, 1970, 22:32:08&nbsp;UTC\n   | undocking_date     = April 17, 1970, 16:43:00&nbsp;UTC\n   | time_docked        = \n }}"}, {"name": "crew_size", "value": "3"}, {"name": "crew_members", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |[[Jim Lovell|James A.

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\n\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

We've had a Main&nbsp;B Bus undervolt.\"<ref name = \"journal Houston\" />\n\nLovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage. Haise checked the status of the fuel cells, and found that two of them were dead. Mission rules forbade entering lunar orbit unless all fuel cells were operational.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nIn the minutes after the accident, there were several unusual readings, showing that tank{{nbsp}}2 was empty and tank{{nbsp}}1's pressure slowly falling, that the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|computer on the spacecraft]] had reset, and that the high-gain antenna was not working. Liebergot initially missed the worrying signs from tank{{nbsp}}2 following the stir, as he was focusing on tank{{nbsp}}1, believing that its reading would be a good guide to what was present in tank{{nbsp}}2; so did controllers supporting him in the \"back room\".  When Kranz questioned Liebergot on this he initially responded that there might be false readings due to an instrumentation problem; he was often teased about that in the years to come.<ref name = \"Cass 1\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution|date=April 1, 2005|accessdate=August 30, 2019|website=IEEE}}</ref> Lovell, looking out the window, reported \"a gas of some sort\" venting into space, making it clear that there was a serious problem.{{sfn|Houston, Heflin & Aaron|2015|p=215}}\n\nSince the fuel cells needed oxygen to operate, when Oxygen Tank{{nbsp}}1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell would shut down, meaning the CSM's only significant sources of power and oxygen would be the CM's batteries and its oxygen \"surge tank\".

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\n\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

The normal procedure, in lunar orbit, was to release the LM then use the service module's RCS to pull the CSM away, but by this point the SM had already been released. [[Grumman]], manufacturer of the LM, assigned a team of University of Toronto engineers, led by senior scientist [[Bernard Etkin]], to solve the problem of how much air pressure to use to push the modules apart.

The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated by nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970.

After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated by nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules. The report questioned the use of Teflon and other materials shown to be flammable in supercritical oxygen, such as aluminum, within the tank.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=5-6\u20135-7, 5-12\u20135-13}} The board found no evidence pointing to any other theory of the accident.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-37}}\n\n[[Shock (mechanics)|Mechanical shock]] forced the oxygen valves closed on the number{{nbsp}}1 and number{{nbsp}}3 fuel cells, putting them out of commission.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-40}} The sudden failure of Oxygen Tank{{nbsp}}2 compromised Oxygen Tank{{nbsp}}1, causing its contents to leak out, possibly through a damaged line or valve, over the next 130&nbsp;minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=372}}{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-43}} With both SM oxygen tanks emptying, and with other damage to the SM, the mission had to be aborted.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=375}} The board praised the response to the emergency, \"The imperfection in Apollo&nbsp;13 constituted a near disaster, averted only by outstanding performance on the part of the crew and the ground control team which supported them.\"{{sfn|Accident report|p=ii}}\n\nOxygen Tank&nbsp;2 was manufactured by the [[Beech Aircraft Company]] of Boulder, Colorado, as subcontractor to [[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]] (NAR) of Downey, California, prime contractor for the CSM.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-2}} It contained two thermostatic switches, originally designed for the command module's 28-volt DC power, but which could fail if subjected to the 65 volts used during ground testing at KSC.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} Under the original 1962 specifications, the switches would be rated for 28 volts, but revised specifications issued in 1965 called for 65 volts to allow for quicker tank pressurization at KSC. Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header =\n | image1 = Honeycomb panel test (S70-41982).jpg\n | alt1 = Panel in the process of being blown out\n | caption1 = \n | image2 = Honeycomb panel test (S70-41983).jpg\n | alt2 = Further along in the process\n | caption2 = Panel similar to the SM Sector{{nbsp}}4 cover being ejected during a test performed as part of the investigation\n}}\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied. Temperatures on the heater tube within the tank may have reached {{convert|1,000|F|C|order=flip|-1}}, most likely damaging the Teflon insulation.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} The temperature gauge was not designed to read higher than {{convert|85|F|C|order=flip}}, so the technician monitoring the procedure detected nothing unusual.
