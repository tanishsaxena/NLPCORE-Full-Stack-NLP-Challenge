Engel, ''Kypros,'' i. 111 ff.</ref>\n\n===Hellenistic Era===\nAbout 385-380 BC, the philhellene [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]] of Salamis was similarly opposed by Amathus, allied with [[Citium]] and [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]];<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] xiv. 98.</ref> and even after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the city resisted annexation, and was bound over to give hostages to [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]].<ref>Diodorus Siculus xix. 62.</ref> Its political importance was now ended but its temple of [[Adonis]] and [[Amathusia|Aphrodite Amathusia]] remained famous in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]]. The epithet ''Amathusia'' in Roman poetry often means little more than \"Cypriote,\" but attesting to the fame of the city.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFrom the 4th century BC the pedestals of two sculptures donated by the last Basileus of Amathous, Androkles, representing his two sons, Orestheus and Andragoras, have survived. Their inscriptions are in both Eteozypric and Greek languages.\n\nThe decline of Amathous is often measured by the Ptolemaic gifts to [[Argos]], where Amathous donated only 40 drachmas in 170-160 BC, but Kition and Salamis gave 208, Kourion 172, and Paphos 100. However, this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion, a bath, a gymnasium, as well as fortifications of the Acropolis, including a new tower. However, the port of Paphos lost traffic compared to Amathous in the Ptolemaic period, an indication that Paphos as the capital of the island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons, like Amathous.<ref>Giorgos Papantoniou: Religion and Social Transformations in Cyprus. From the Cypriot Basileis to the Hellenistic Strategos, Brill, 2012, S. 221.</ref>\n\n===Roman Era===\n\nIn the Roman era Amathus became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of Cyprus.\n\nA Roman temple was built in the 1st century AD on top of the Hellenistic predecessor. The temple facilities remained so important in Roman times that 'Amathusia' was used as a synonym for 'Cypriot'.\n\n===Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages===\nLater, in the 4th century AD, Amasus became the see of a Christian bishop and continued to flourish until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. Of its bishops, Heliodorus was at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 and Alexander at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787. In the late 6th century, Saint Ioannis Eleimonas (John the Charitable), protector of the [[Knights of St. John]], was born in Amathus and after 614 sent Theodorus, bishop of Amathus, to Jerusalem to ransom some slaves.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1063-1066</ref><ref>Sim\u00e9on Vailh\u00e9, v.

Much later, in 1869, a great number of blocks of stone from Amathus were used for the construction of the [[Suez Canal]]. A ruined [[Byzantian Empire|Byzantine]] church marks its site.\n\n===In modern times===\nA new settlement close to Amathus but further inland, Agios Tychonas, is named after the bishop Saint [[Tychon of Amathus]]. The site of the ruins is within the borders of this village, though the expansion of the Limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins: it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the Amathus necropolis.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1100"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Amathus during the First Iron Age"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 1997"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Pierre"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Aupert"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "308"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "308"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "19\u201325"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.2307/1357406"}, {"name": "jstor", "value": "1357406"}]}, {"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Amathus"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "page", "value": "783"}, {"name": "first", "value": "John Linton"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Myres"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "John Myres"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-88-209-9070-1"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Pre-history and ancient era", "paragraphs": "[[File:Ancient kingdoms of Cyprus en.svg|thumb|Ancient kingdoms of Cyprus]]\nThe pre-history of Amathus mixes myth and [[archaeology]].<ref>T.

Their inscriptions are in both Eteozypric and Greek languages.\n\nThe decline of Amathous is often measured by the Ptolemaic gifts to [[Argos]], where Amathous donated only 40 drachmas in 170-160 BC, but Kition and Salamis gave 208, Kourion 172, and Paphos 100. However, this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion, a bath, a gymnasium, as well as fortifications of the Acropolis, including a new tower. However, the port of Paphos lost traffic compared to Amathous in the Ptolemaic period, an indication that Paphos as the capital of the island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons, like Amathous.<ref>Giorgos Papantoniou: Religion and Social Transformations in Cyprus.
