Next to each name is a checkbox (or another similar way to mark \"Yes\" or \"No\" for that candidate).\n\nEach candidate may be treated as a separate question: \"Do you approve of this person for the job?\". Approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one, some, or all candidates. All votes count equally, and everyone gets the same number of votes: one vote per candidate, either for or against. Final tallies show how many voters support each candidate, and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support.\n\nBallots on which the voter marked every candidate the same (whether yes or no) usually have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot separates candidates into two groups: those supported and those that are not. Each candidate approved is considered preferred to any candidate not approved, while the voter's preferences among approved candidates is unspecified, and likewise, the voter's preferences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified.\n\nApproval voting can be considered a form of [[range voting]], with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1\u2014or a form of [[majority judgment]], with grades restricted to ''good'' and ''poor''.

Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the ''same'' rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them.\n\nApproval voting allows for [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] and [[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]],  while it is immune to [[Tactical voting#Push-over|Push-Over]] and [[Tactical voting#Burying|Burying]].\n\n[[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] occurs when a voter approves ''only'' candidate 'a' instead of ''both'' 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either 'a' or 'b' but has a moderate preference for 'a'. Were 'b' to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied.\n\n[[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]] occurs when a voter approves an ''additional'' candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.\n\n=== Sincere voting ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those \"... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.'\"{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.  When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.\n\n==== Examples ====\n\nBased on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:\n*vote for A, B, C, and D\n*vote for A, B, and C\n*vote for A and B\n*vote for A\n*vote for no candidates\n\nIf the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:\n*vote for A and C\n\nThe decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary \"approval cutoff.\" All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.\n\n=== Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences ===\n\nA sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. [[tactical voting|Voting strategy]] is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it.<ref name=probstrat>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955800 | last = Niemi |first=R.

In some cases, approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a [[Condorcet winner]] and a [[Condorcet loser]], without the voter preferences changing.  To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Yilmaz | first=M.

For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is [[strategy-proof]] (also known as strategy-free).{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=31}}  When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=38}}  However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical.  It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nHaving dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates.  All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=16\u201317}}  A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates\u2014prefers A to B and B to C\u2014does not have dichotomous preferences.\n\nBeing strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}\n==== Approval threshold ====\n\nAnother way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold.  An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of.  A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate.  Acceptance thresholds are similar.  With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nWith threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist.  However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting.  Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the [[Condorcet criterion]] and other social choice criteria.<ref name=critstrats>{{Cite journal |last1=Brams |first1=S.

On the one hand, approval voting fails the [[later-no-harm criterion]], so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more preferred candidate.  On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate.  Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others vote.\n\nA [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 |last1=Myerson |first1=R. |last2=Weber |first2=R. J. | year = 1993 | title = A theory of Voting Equilibria | jstor = 2938959| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 102\u2013114 |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/782.pdf }}</ref>  This strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voter's [[Utility#Expected utility|expected utility]], subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large.\n\nAn optimal approval vote always votes for the most preferred candidate and not for the least preferred candidate.  However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.<ref>Smith, Warren [http://scorevoting.net/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/newgibbsat.pdf Completion of Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem; range voting and voter honesty]. Actually, there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates, and definitely none for 3 candidates; the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown.</ref>\n\nOther strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations.  For example:\n* Vote for the candidates that have above average utility.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=85}}\n* Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner-up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities.\n*Vote for the most preferred candidate only.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating.\n\nAnother strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=74, 81}}</ref>\n\nOptimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a [[Condorcet loser criterion|Condorcet loser]].  Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances.  For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.<ref>Laslier, J.-F.

The utilities are consistent with the rankings given earlier and reflect a strong preference each faction has for choosing its city, compared to weaker preferences for other factors such as the distance to the other cities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Voter utilities for each candidate city\n! &nbsp; !! colspan=\"4\" | Candidates !! &nbsp;\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Fraction of voters<br /><small>(living close to)</small>\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Memphis\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Nashville\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Chattanooga\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Knoxville\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Average\n|- style=\"xbackground:#fdd; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Memphis (42%)\n| 100 || 15 || 10 || 0 || 31.25\n|- style=\"xbackground:#cfc; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nashville (26%)\n| 0 || 100 || 20 || 15 || 33.75\n|- style=\"xbackground:#ddf; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Chattanooga (15%)\n| 0 || 15 || 100 || 35 || 37.5\n|- style=\"xbackground:#fed; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Knoxville (17%)\n| 0 || 15 || 40 || 100 || 38.75\n|}\n\nUsing these utilities, voters choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties.  In each of the scenarios summarized below, all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Approval voting results <br /> for scenarios using optimal strategic voting\n! colspan=\"3\" | &nbsp; !! colspan=\"4\" | Candidate vote totals\n|-\n! xwidth=25% | Strategy scenario\n! xwidth=15% | Winner\n! xwidth=15% | Runner-up\n! xwidth=15% | Memphis\n! xwidth=15% | Nashville\n! xwidth=15% | Chattanooga\n! xwidth=15% | Knoxville\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Zero-info\n| Memphis || Chattanooga || 42 || 26 || 32 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Memphis leading Chattanooga\n| colspan=\"2\" | Three-way tie || 42 || 58 || 58 || 58\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Chattanooga leading Knoxville\n| Chattanooga || Nashville || 42 || 68 || 83 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Chattanooga leading Nashville\n| Nashville || Memphis || 42 || 68 || 32 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Nashville leading Memphis\n| Nashville || Memphis || 42 || 58 || 32 || 32\n|}\n\nIn the first scenario, voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely.  As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility.  Most voters vote for only their first choice.  Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga.  As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.\n\nIn the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.\n\nIn the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.\n\nOnly in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[game theory]], this is an \"equilibrium.\"  In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.\n\n===Dichotomous cutoff===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}As this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others.  While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.\n\nFor example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, if voters' threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|+ A drops out, candidates voting for above average approval\n!

Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the ''same'' rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them.\n\nApproval voting allows for [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] and [[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]],  while it is immune to [[Tactical voting#Push-over|Push-Over]] and [[Tactical voting#Burying|Burying]].\n\n[[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] occurs when a voter approves ''only'' candidate 'a' instead of ''both'' 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either 'a' or 'b' but has a moderate preference for 'a'. Were 'b' to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied.\n\n[[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]] occurs when a voter approves an ''additional'' candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2019"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": " Sincere voting ", "paragraphs": "{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those \"... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.'\"{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.

Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others vote.\n\nA [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 |last1=Myerson |first1=R. |last2=Weber |first2=R.

As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.\n\nIn the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.\n\nIn the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.\n\nOnly in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[game theory]], this is an \"equilibrium.\"  In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2019"}]}], "id": 15}, {"title": "Dichotomous cutoff", "paragraphs": "{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}As this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others.  While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.\n\nFor example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|-\n!

Plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a \"lesser of evils\" to win.\n* However, approval voting forces voters to face an initial voting tactical decision as to whether to vote for (or ''approve'') of their second-choice candidate or not. The voter may want to retain expression of preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice.  But that does not allow the same voter to express preference of their second choice over any other.\n* Approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections, as ballots are cast, so that final tallies are immediately available after the election, without any upgrades to equipment. Approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level.\n* If voters are sincere, approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme. If backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and \"bullet vote\" for that first choice, they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere preferences.\n* If voters are sincere, candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor, and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so. However, a candidate may win a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups.\n* Approval voting fails the majority criterion, because a candidate who is preferred by a majority of voters is not always elected. In some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate preferred by a mere majority, if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority. In other cases, with elections having three or more candidates, approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also preferred by a majority, if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win, while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective (i.e. vote only for the extreme candidate), leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented.\n* Suppose a candidate is eliminated (say, for medical reasons) between a primary election and the party convention. With plurality voting, voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise. Approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates.\n* Approval voting without write-ins is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g., representative [[recall election|recall]]).\n* Unlike plurality voting, approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one, increasing the probability an alternative wins.\n* In contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting may revert to [[plurality voting]]. Some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their preferred candidate than as compromise choices. Score voting and [[Majority Judgment]] allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings, but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2019"}]}], "id": 18}, {"title": " Multiple winners ", "paragraphs": "\nApproval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections.
