[[Muscle tissue]] functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three main types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]]. Smooth muscle has no [[Striated muscle tissue|striations]] when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as [[sea anemone]] tentacles and the body wall of [[sea cucumber]]s. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two.

In some slow-moving [[Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] marine animals such as [[ctenophore]]s and [[cnidarian]]s (including [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]]), the nerves form a [[nerve net]], but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along [[biological neural network|neural networks]] to other parts of the organism.

They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C.

They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[lizard]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their [[lung]]s by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].<ref name=Dorit865>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/861 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.<ref name=Dorit868>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/865 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.<ref name=Dorit868/>\n\n'''[[Lizards]]''' have skulls with only one [[Nasal fenestra|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.<ref name=Dorit868/>\n\n'''[[Snakes]]''' are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent \"spectacle\" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.<ref name=Dorit870>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/870 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.<ref name=Dorit874>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/874 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused.

Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]].

They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialized as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.<ref name=Dorit914>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/909 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.

Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent \"spectacle\" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull.

The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialized as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate.

The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].<ref name=BritMicro/>\n\nEqually important advances have occurred in  ''non-invasive'' techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and used in medical [[radiography]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232044/http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | archive-date=3 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "History of anatomy"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Porter"}, {"name": "first", "value": "R."}, {"name": "year", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Harper Collins"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-00-215173-3"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "49\u201350"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Longrigg"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "James"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Anatomy in Alexandria in the Third Century B.C"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "The British Journal for the History of Science"}, {"name": "date", "value": "December 1988"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "21"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "4"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "455\u2013488"}, {"name": "jstor", "value": "4026964"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1017/s000708740002536x"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "11621690"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Bay"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Noel Si Yang"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Bay"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Boon-Huat"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Greek Anatomists Herophilus: The Father of Anatomy"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Anatomy and Cell Biology"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "43"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "3"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "280\u2013283"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.5115/acb.2010.43.4.280"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "3026179"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "21267401"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Von Staden"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "H"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Discovery of the Body: Human Dissection and Its Cultural Contexts in Ancient Greece"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1992"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "65"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "3"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "223\u2013241"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "1285450"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "2589595"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Bay"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Noel Si Yang"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Bay"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Boon- Huat"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Greek Anatomist Herophilus: The Father of Anatomy"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Anatomy & Cell Biology"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "43"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "3"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "280\u2013283"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.5115/acb.2010.43.4.280"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "3026179"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "21267401"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Eccles"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "John"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Erasistratus Biography (304B.C-250B.C)"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/12/Erasistratus.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "faqs.org"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "faqs.org"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "25 November 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Britannica"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Erasistratus of Ceos: Greek Physician"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.britannica.com/biography/Erasistratus-of-Ceos"}, {"name": "website", "value": "britannica.com"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "The Encyclopedia of Britannica"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "25 November 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Wiltse"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "LL"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Pait"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "TG"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Herophilus of Alexandria (325-255 B.C.)

As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].<ref name=pmid1717373426>{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Laing MR, Hutchison JD | title = Nineteenth century medical education for tomorrow's doctors | journal = Scottish Medical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 45\u201349 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17373426 | doi=10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.45}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15712576\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Hutchison JD | title = Sir John Struthers MD FRCS Edin LLD Glasg: Anatomist, zoologist and pioneer in medical education | journal = The Surgeon | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 347\u2013351 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15712576 | doi=10.1016/s1479-666x(04)80035-0}}</ref> From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.<ref name=\"McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53\">McLachlan, J. & Patten, D. 2006.

He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534198/Ignaz-Philipp-Semmelweis |title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Siemens-electron-microscope.jpg|upright|thumb|An electron microscope from 1973]]\nBefore the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were [[dissection]] of the dead and [[inspection]], [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] of the living. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of [[histology]] and [[Cell biology|cytology]] began in the late 19th century<ref name=BritMicro>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of [[biopsy]] specimens. The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].<ref name=BritMicro/>\n\nEqually important advances have occurred in  ''non-invasive'' techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and used in medical [[radiography]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232044/http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | archive-date=3 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "further", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "History of anatomy in the 19th century"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Sappol, Michael"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Princeton University Press"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Princeton, NJ"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-691-05925-9"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Death, Dissection, and the Destitute"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Penguin"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Richardson, Ruth"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1989"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-14-022862-5"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chb/lectures/anatomy1.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Introductory Anatomy"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Leeds"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "25 June 2013"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Johnson, D.R."}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.jefferson.edu/about/eakins/forbes.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Reproduction of Portrait of Professor William S.
