He published two early aviation trade journals.\n\nHe is frequently cited as the inventor of the [[airliner]] and was awarded several of the first air mail contracts, which he ultimately could not fulfill. He founded the Lawson Aircraft Company in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], to build military training aircraft and later the [[Lawson Airplane Company-Continental Faience and Tile Company|Lawson Airplane Company]] in [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], to build airliners.<ref>Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame.

It sold for 10 cents a copy from newsstands across the country. In 1910, moving to New York City, he renamed the magazine \"Aircraft\" and published it until 1914. The magazine chronicled the technical developments of the early aviation pioneers. He was the first advocate for commercial air travel, coining the term \"airline.\" He also advocated for a strong American flying force, lobbying Congress in 1913 to expand its appropriations for Army aircraft.\n\nIn early 1913, he learned to fly the Sloan-Deperdussin and the [[Bl\u00e9riot XI|Moisant-Bleriot]] monoplanes, becoming an accomplished pilot. Later that year he bought a Thomas flying boat and became the first air commuter regularly flying from his country house in Seidler's Beach NJ to the foot of 75th Street in NYC (about 35 miles). In 1917, utilizing the knowledge gained from 10 years advocating aviation, he built his first airplane, the Lawson Military Tractor 1 (MT-1) trainer, and founded the Lawson Aircraft Corporation. The company's plant was sited at Green Bay, Wisconsin. There he secured a contract and built the Lawson MT-2. He also designed the steel fuselage Lawson Armored Battler, which never got beyond the drafting board, given doubts within the Army aviation community and the signing of the armistice.\n\n[[File:Lawson T-2.jpg|left|thumb|Lawson C.2 or T-2]]\nAfter the war, in 1919 Lawson started a project to build America's first airline. He secured financial backing, and in five months he had built and demonstrated in flight his biplane airliner, the 18-passenger [[Lawson L-2]]. He demonstrated its capabilities in a 2000-mile multi-city tour from Milwaukee to Chicago-Toledo-Cleveland-Buffalo-Syracuse-New york City-Washington, D.C.-Collinsville-Dayton-Chicago and back to Milwaukee, creating a buzz of positive press.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alfred|first=Lawson|title=200 Mile Trip in First Airliner|year=1928|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bb1BAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA146&dq=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&f=false}}</ref>  The publicity allowed him to secure an additional $1 million to build the 26-passenger [[Lawson L-4|Midnight Liner]]. The aircraft crashed on takeoff on its maiden flight. In late 1920, he secured government contracts for three airmail routes and to deliver 10 war planes, but owing to the fall 1920 recession, he could not secure the necessary $100,000 in cash reserves called for in the contracts and had to decline them. In 1926 he started his last airliner, the 56-seat, two-tier Lawson super airliner.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lawson \u2013 Aircraft Industry Builder|year=1930|publisher=Humanity publishing company}}</ref>\nIn this phase of his life, he was considered one of the leading thinkers in the budding American commercial aviation community, but his troubles with getting financial backing for his ideas led him to turn to economics, philosophy, and organization.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Alfred"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Lawson"}, {"name": "title", "value": "200 Mile Trip in First Airliner"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1928"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=Bb1BAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA146&dq=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&f=false"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Lawson \u2013 Aircraft Industry Builder"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1930"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Humanity publishing company"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Lawsonomy (1929\u20131954)", "paragraphs": "In the 1920s, he promoted health practices, including [[vegetarianism]], and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200.

In 1952, he was brought before a [[United States Senate]] investigative committee on allegations that his organization had bought war surplus machines and then sold them for a profit, despite claiming [[non-profit]] status.
