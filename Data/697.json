Therefore, Agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the ''[[agoge]].''

On the eve of sailing from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as [[Agamemnon]] had done before the [[Troy|Trojan]] expedition, but the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.\n\n[[File:Altikulac Sarcophagus Dynast of Hellespontine Phrygia attacking a Greek psiloi early 4th century BCE.jpg|thumb|left|Armoured cavalry of Achaemenid [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] attacking a Greek [[psiloi]] at the time of the invasion of Agesilaus, [[Alt\u0131kula\u00e7 Sarcophagus]], early 4th century BCE.]]\nOn his arrival at [[Ephesus]] in 396 BC, a three months' truce was concluded with [[Tissaphernes]], the [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination Agesilaus raided [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], where he easily won immense booty from the satrap [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]]; Tissaphernes could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria. In these campaigns Agesilaus also benefited from the aid of some of the [[Ten Thousand]] (a Greek mercenary army), who had marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea a few years earlier (401-399 BC). After spending the winter organizing a [[cavalry]] force (''[[hippeis]]''), he made a successful incursion into [[Lydia]] in the spring of 395. [[Tithraustes]] was sent to replace Tissaphernes, who paid with his life for his continued failure.\n\n[[File:CUH Agesilaus and Pharnabazus.jpg|thumb|Meeting between Spartan king Agesilaus (left) and [[Pharnabazus II]] (right) in 395 BC, when Agesilaus agreed to remove himself from Hellespontine Phrygia.]]\nAn armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus, who left the southern [[satrap]]y and again invaded [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], which he ravaged until the following spring.  He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus whom he met personally, and once more turned southward.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>\n\nDuring these campaigns, [[Lysander]] attempted to manipulate Agesilaus into ceding his authority. Agesilaus would have nothing of this, and reminded Lysander (who was only a Spartan general) who was king. He had Lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].
