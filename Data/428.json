The size of the upper [[canine tooth]] in ''A. ramidus'' males was not distinctly different from that of females. Their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size, as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth. The features of the upper canine in ''A. ramidus'' contrast with the [[sexual dimorphism]] observed in common chimpanzees, where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females.<ref name=\"Suwa_2009b\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1175824 |pmid=19810195 |title=Paleobiological Implications of the Ardipithecus ramidus Dentition |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5949 |pages=94\u20139 |year=2009 |last1=Suwa |first1=G. |last2=Kono |first2=R.

In particular, it has been used to suggest that the [[last common ancestor]] of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition \"compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition.\"<ref name=\"Suwa_2009b\"/>\n\n''A. ramidus'' existed more recently than the [[most recent common ancestor]] of humans and chimpanzees ([[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|CLCA or ''Pan''-''Homo'' LCA]]) and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; ''A. ramidus'' feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of ''A. ramidus'' are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. \"Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools,\" the research team concluded.<ref name=\"AndThePaleobiology\" />\n\n=== Ardi ===\n{{Main|Ardi}}\nOn October 1, [[2009 in science|2009]], paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ''A. ramidus'' fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994.

Consequently, it is argued the species represents a unique ontogeny unlike any extant ape. The reduced growth in the sub-nasal alveolar region of the face, which houses the projecting canine complex in chimpanzees, suggests the species had rates of growth and reproductive biology unlike any living primate species. In this sense the species may show the first trend towards human social, parenting and sexual psychology. Consequently, the authors argue it is no longer tenable to extrapolate from chimpanzees in reconstructions of early hominin social and mating behaviour, providing further evidence against the so-called 'chimpanzee referential model'.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145815 |ssrn=2158266 |title=Human Evolution and the Chimpanzee Referential Doctrine |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=41 |pages=119\u201338 |year=2012 |last1=Sayers |first1=Ken |last2=Raghanti |first2=Mary Ann |last3=Lovejoy |first3=C.

In other words, humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio-emotional development. As ''A. ramidus'' no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of a prognathic jaw with a C/P3 complex (which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species), young and sub-adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group. The implication of these interspecific differences is that ''A. ramidus'' would have most likely had a period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees. Consequently, it is possible that in ''A.ramidus'' we see the first, albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisation'.<ref name=\"Clark & Henneberg 2015\"/>\n\nThis view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of ''A.ramidus''. The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould's theory in [[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'']] that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "doi", "value": "10.1038/nature09709"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "21331035"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Wood"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Bernard"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Harrison"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Terry"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The evolutionary context of the first hominins"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "470"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "347\u201335"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "2011Natur.470..347W"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "7334"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "doi", "value": "10.1126/science.1184148"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "20508113"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Comment on the Paleobiology and Classification of Ardipithecus ramidus"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Science"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "328"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "5982"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1105; author reply 1105"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Sarmiento"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "E.

This paper argued that erect posture, significant cervical lordosis, reduced facial projection as well as \"flexed\" cranial base architecture indicate this species possessed greater facility to modulate vocalisations than both chimpanzees and bonobos.<ref name=\"Clark & Henneberg 2017\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101\u2013121 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}</ref> This is a controversial finding as it pushes language origins back some 4.5Ma into the late Miocene and early Pliocene suggesting that human vocal capability may have much deeper roots in the hominin lineage than traditionally supposed. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that paleoanthropologists to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity. As they write:\n\n{{quote|text=In the paleoanthropological literature, these changes in early hominin skull morphology [reduced facial prognathism and lack of canine armoury] have to date been analysed in terms of a shift in mating and social behaviour, with little consideration given to vocally mediated sociality. Similarly, in the literature on language evolution there is a distinct lacuna regarding links between craniofacial correlates of social and mating systems and vocal ability. These are surprising oversights given that pro-sociality and vocal capability require identical alterations to the common ancestral skull and skeletal configuration. We therefore propose a model which integrates data on whole organism morphogenesis with evidence for a potential early emergence of hominin socio-vocal adaptations. Consequently, we suggest vocal capability may have evolved much earlier than has been traditionally proposed. Instead of emerging in the ''Homo genus'', we suggest the palaeoecological context of late Miocene and early Pliocene forests and woodlands facilitated the evolution of hominin socio-vocal capability. We also propose that paedomorphic morphogenesis of the skull via the process of self-domestication enabled increased levels of pro-social behaviour, as well as increased capacity for socially synchronous vocalisation to evolve at the base of the hominin clade.<ref name=\"Clark & Henneberg 2017\"/>}}\n\nWhile the skull of ''A.ramidus'', according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest ''A.ramidus'' - based on similar vocal tract ratios - may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:\n\n{{quote|text=Some propose that as a result of paedomorphic morphogenesis of the cranial base and craniofacial morphology ''Ar. ramidus'' would have not been limited in terms of the mechanical components of speech production as chimpanzees and bonobos are. It is possible that ''Ar. ramidus'' had vocal capability approximating that of chimpanzees and bonobos, with its idiosyncratic skull morphology not resulting in any significant advances in speech capability.\n\nIn this sense the anatomical features analysed in this essay would have been exapted in later more voluble species of hominin. However, given the selective advantages of pro-social vocal synchrony, we suggest the species would have developed significantly more complex vocal abilities than chimpanzees and bonobos.<ref name=\"Clark & Henneberg 2017\"/>}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Non-free", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "section"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "28363458"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "HOMO"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "68"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "101\u2013121"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2017"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Clark"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Gary"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Henneberg"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Maciej"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "text", "value": "In the paleoanthropological literature, these changes in early hominin skull morphology [reduced facial prognathism and lack of canine armoury] have to date been analysed in terms of a shift in mating and social behaviour, with little consideration given to vocally mediated sociality.
