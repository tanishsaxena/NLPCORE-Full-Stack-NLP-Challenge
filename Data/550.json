It is easier to identify them by looking at the total mass of both the antiparticle and particle. On the left, from top to bottom, is shown an electron (small red dot), a proton (big blue dot), and a neutron (big dot, black in the middle, gradually fading to white near the edges).

From top to bottom; [[electron]]/[[positron]], [[proton]]/[[antiproton]], [[neutron]]/[[antineutron]].]]\n\nIn [[particle physics]], every type of [[particle]] has an associated '''antiparticle''' with the same [[mass]] but with opposite [[charge (physics)|physical charges]] (such as [[electric charge]]). For example, the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is the [[antielectron]] (which is often referred to as ''positron''). While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of [[radioactive decay]].  The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.\n\nSome particles, such as the [[photon]], are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter (the kind all matter usually interacted with is made of), and the other (usually given the prefix \"anti-\") as ''[[antimatter]]''.\n\nParticle\u2013antiparticle pairs can [[particle annihilation|annihilate]] each other, producing [[photon]]s; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of [[gamma ray]]s, a process exploited in [[positron emission tomography]].\n\nThe laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an [[antiproton]] and a [[positron]] can form an [[antihydrogen]] [[atom]], which is believed to have the same properties as a [[hydrogen]] atom. This leads to the question of why the [[baryogenesis|formation of matter after the Big Bang]] resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and [[antimatter]]. The discovery of [[CP violation|Charge Parity violation]] helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.\n\nBecause [[Charge (physics)|charge]] is [[Charge conservation|conserved]], it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge (as is for instance the case when antiparticles are produced naturally via [[beta decay]] or the collision of [[cosmic ray]]s with Earth's atmosphere), or by the simultaneous creation of both a particle ''and'' its antiparticle, which can occur in [[particle accelerator]]s such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].\n\nAlthough particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of [[quark]]s, the [[antineutron]] from [[Quark#Antiquarks|antiquarks]], and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as [[photon]]s, [[W and Z bosons#Z boson|Z<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;bosons]], [[Pi meson|{{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}]]&nbsp;[[meson]]s, and hypothetical [[graviton]]s and some hypothetical [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]]s.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Small localized object; a rare type of matter"}]}, {"name": "SubatomicParticle", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pion0"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " History ", "paragraphs": "\n=== Experiment ===\n\nIn 1932, soon after the prediction of [[positron]]s by [[Paul Dirac]], [[Carl D.

Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then\n::<math>T\\ |p,\\sigma,n\\rangle \\ \\propto \\ |-p,-\\sigma,n\\rangle ,</math>\n::<math>CP\\ |p,\\sigma,n\\rangle \\ \\propto \\ |-p,\\sigma,n^c\\rangle ,</math>\n::<math>C\\ |p,\\sigma,n\\rangle \\ \\propto \\ |p,\\sigma,n^c\\rangle ,</math>\nwhere the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have\n*the same mass m\n*the same spin state J\n*opposite [[electric charge]]s q and -q.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5}, {"title": " Quantum field theory ", "paragraphs": ":''This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of [[canonical quantization]] of a [[quantum field theory]].''\n\nOne may try to quantize an electron [[field (physics)|field]] without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing\n\n::<math>\\psi (x)=\\sum_{k}u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t},\\,</math>\n\nwhere we use the symbol ''k'' to denote the quantum numbers ''p'' and \u03c3 of the previous section and the sign of the energy, ''E(k)'', and ''a<sub>k</sub>'' denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with [[fermion]]s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]\n\n::<math>H=\\sum_{k} E(k) a^\\dagger_k a_k,\\,</math>\n\nthen one sees immediately that the expectation value of ''H'' need not be positive. This is because ''E(k)'' can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.\n\nSo one has to introduce the charge conjugate ''antiparticle'' field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations\n\n::<math>b_{k\\prime} = a^\\dagger_k\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ b^\\dagger_{k\\prime}=a_k,\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' has the same ''p'', and opposite \u03c3 and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form\n\n::<math>\\psi(x)=\\sum_{k_+} u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t}+\\sum_{k_-} u_k (x)b^\\dagger _k e^{-iE(k)t},\\,</math>\n\nwhere the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes\n\n::<math>H=\\sum_{k_+} E_k a^\\dagger _k a_k + \\sum_{k_-} |E(k)|b^\\dagger_k b_k + E_0,\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''E<sub>0</sub>'' is an infinite negative constant. The [[vacuum state]] is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, ''i.e.'', <math>a_k |0\\rangle=0</math> and <math>b_k |0\\rangle=0</math>. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly ''E<sub>0</sub>''. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, '''H''' is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of ''a<sub>k</sub>'' and ''b<sub>k</sub>'' shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a [[fermion]].\n\nThis approach is due to [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Wendell Furry]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. If one quantizes a real [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]], then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.\n\n=== Feynman\u2013Stueckelberg interpretation <!--'[[Feynman\u2013Stueckelberg interpretation]]', '[[Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation]]', '[[Stueckelberg\u2013Feynman interpretation]]', '[[Stueckelberg-Feynman interpretation]]', '[[Feynman\u2013St\u00fcckelberg interpretation]]', '[[Feynman-St\u00fcckelberg interpretation]]', '[[St\u00fcckelberg\u2013Feynman interpretation]]', and '[[St\u00fcckelberg-Feynman interpretation]]' redirect here-->===\n\nBy considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass '''m''' and spin '''J''' but opposite charges '''q'''.
