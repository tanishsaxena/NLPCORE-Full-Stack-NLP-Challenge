Scott then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland. In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient furniture, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with [[Scottish history]], notably the Celtic [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] and the [[Woodwrae Stone]], all now in the [[Museum of Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nms.ac.uk/torrsponycap|title=Torrs pony cap|publisher=Museum of Scotland|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/34845/woodrae-castle|title=Woodrae Castle: Cross Slab(S) (Pictish), Pictish Symbol Stone(S) (Pictish)|work=Canmore|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe last and principal acquisition was that of Toftfield (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817. The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n[[File:Abbotsford.House.ground.plan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ground plan of Abbotsford House.]]\n[[File:Abbotsford House Study Room.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Study room]]\nThe general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the [[Scottish Baronial]]. The estate is recognized as a highly influential creation for the Scottish Baronial style with themes from Abbotsford being reflected across many buildings in the Scottish Borders.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buck|first=Michael|date=1 November 2013|title=Early Planning at Abbotsford, 1811\u201312: Walter Scott, William Stark and the Cottage that Never Was|url=|journal=Architectural Heritage : The Journal of the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland|volume=24|pages=41\u201365|via=}}</ref> The manor as a whole appears as a \"castle-in-miniature,\" with small towers and imitation battlements decorating the house and garden walls.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Irving|first=Gordon|date=July 1971|title=Sir Walter Scott's Abbotsford House|url=|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|volume=(1908-Current File)|pages=13|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh|old Tolbooth]] in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Scott collected many of these curiosities to be built into the walls of the South Garden, which previously hosted a colonnade of gothic arches along the garden walls. Along the path of the former colonnade sits the remains of Edinburgh's 15th century [[Mercat cross|Mercat Cross]] and several examples of classical sculpture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/3314732/The-ugliest-place-on-Tweedside.html|title='The ugliest place on Tweedside'|last=Russell|first=Vivian|date=2003-10-10|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nThe estate and its neo-Medieval features nod towards Scott's desire for a historical feel, but the writer ensured that the house would provide all the comforts of modern living. As a result, Scott used the space as a proving-ground for new technologies. The house was outfitted with early gas lighting and pneumatic bells connecting residents with servants elsewhere in the house.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rigney|first=Ann|date=2007|title=Abbotsford: Dislocation and Cultural Remembrance|url=|journal=Writers' Houses and the Making of Memory|volume=1|pages=76\u201377|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\nScott had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt. In 1830, the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors. The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by [[Robert Cadell]], the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir Walter's works.  {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nScott's only son Walter did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847. Among subsequent possessors were Scott's grandson Walter Scott Lockhart (later Walter Lockhart Scott, 1826-1853), his younger sister Charlotte Harriet Jane Hope-Scott (n\u00e9e Lockhart) 1828-1858, [[James Hope-Scott|J. R. Hope Scott]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], and his daughter (Scott's great-granddaughter), the [[Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott|Hon. Mrs Maxwell Scott]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Abbotsford Aug2009 01.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2|Abbotsford House as seen from the gardens.]]\nThe house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by Scott's descendants until 2004. The last of his direct descendants to hold the [[Laird]]ship of Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter Dame [[Jean Maxwell-Scott]] (8 June 1923 \u2013 5 May 2004). She inherited it from her elder sister [[Patricia Maxwell-Scott]] in 1998. The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions, after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house. It had electricity installed only in 1962.\n\nDame Jean was at one time a lady-in-waiting to [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], patron of the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier|Dandie Dinmont]] Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir Walter Scott's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir Wattie, ridden by Ian Stark, won two silver medals at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald staff|2004|p=32}}\n\nIn 2005, [[Scottish Borders Council]] was considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank
