Individual grains are seen as the flat surfaces of the crystals.]]\n\n{{Technical|section|date=January 2019}}\nAn '''alloy''' is a combination of [[metal]]s or metals combined with one or more other [[Chemical element|element]]s. For example, combining the metallic elements [[gold]] and [[copper]] produces [[red gold]], gold and [[silver]] becomes [[white gold]], and silver combined with copper produces [[sterling silver]]. Elemental [[iron]], combined with non-metallic [[carbon]] or [[silicon]], produces alloys called [[steel]] or [[silicon steel]]. The resulting mixture forms a substance with properties that often differ from those of the pure metals, such as increased strength or hardness. Unlike other substances that may contain metallic bases but do not behave as metals, such as [[aluminium oxide]] (sapphire), [[beryllium aluminium silicate]] (emerald) or [[sodium chloride]] (salt), an alloy will retain all the properties of a metal in the resulting material, such as [[electrical conductivity]], [[ductility]], [[Opacity (optics)|opaqueness]], and [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]]. Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications, from the steel alloys, used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools, to exotic titanium-alloys used in the aerospace industry, to beryllium-copper alloys for non-sparking tools. In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength. Examples of alloys are steel, [[solder]], [[brass]], [[pewter]], [[duralumin]], [[bronze]] and [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]].\n\nAn alloy may be a [[solid solution]] of metal elements (a single phase, where all metallic grains (crystals) are of the same composition) or a [[mixture]] of metallic phases (two or more solutions, forming a [[microstructure]] of different crystals within the metal). [[Intermetallic]] compounds are alloys with a defined [[stoichiometry]] and crystal structure. [[Zintl phase]]s are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types (see [[Van Arkel\u2013Ketelaar triangle]] for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds).\n\nAlloys are defined by a [[metallic bonding]] character.<ref>Callister, W.D. \"Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction\" 2007, 7th edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, Section 4.3 and Chapter 9.</ref> The alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications, and in [[Atomic ratio|atomic fraction]] for basic science studies. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or [[interstitial alloy]]s, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or [[intermetallic]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Technical", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "section"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 2019"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": "[[File:Born bronze - Bronze casts.jpg|thumb|Liquid [[bronze]], being poured into molds during casting.]]\n[[File:A brass light.JPG|thumb|A [[brass]] lamp.]]\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of [[chemical element]]s, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a [[metal]]. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that, with an alloy, the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties, while impure metals such as [[wrought iron]] are less controlled, but are often considered useful. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be [[solubility|soluble]] and dissolve into the mixture.\nThe mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft ([[malleability|malleable]]), such as [[aluminium]], can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, such as [[copper]]. Although both metals are very soft and [[ductility|ductile]], the resulting [[aluminium alloy]] will have much greater [[strength of materials|strength]]. Adding a small amount of non-metallic [[carbon]] to [[iron]] trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called [[steel]]. Due to its very-high strength, but still substantial [[toughness]], and its ability to be greatly altered by [[heat treatment]], steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use. By adding [[chromium]] to steel, its resistance to [[corrosion]] can be enhanced, creating [[stainless steel]], while adding [[silicon]] will alter its electrical characteristics, producing [[silicon steel]].\n\nLike oil and water, a molten metal may not always mix with another element. For example, pure iron is almost completely [[insoluble]] with copper. Even when the constituents are soluble, each will usually have a [[Saturation (chemistry)#Solutions|saturation point]], beyond which no more of the constituent can be added. Iron, for example, can hold a maximum of 6.67% carbon. Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the [[liquid]] state, they may not always be soluble in the [[solid]] state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a [[solid solution]], becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a [[phase (matter)|phase]]. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous [[microstructure]] of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. If cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice, becoming more stable, and forming a second phase that serves to reinforce the crystals internally.\n\nSome alloys, such as [[electrum]]\u2014an alloy of [[silver]] and [[gold]]\u2014occur naturally. Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and [[nickel]], but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was [[bronze]], which is a mixture of the metals [[tin]] and [[copper]]. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires ([[smelting]]) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include [[pewter]], [[brass]] and [[pig iron]]. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. [[Carbon steel]] can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like [[mild steel]] or hard alloys like [[spring steel]]. [[Alloy steel]]s can be made by adding other elements, such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]] or [[nickel]], resulting in alloys such as [[high-speed steel]] or [[tool steel]]. Small amounts of [[manganese]] are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]], which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most alloys were not created until the 1900s, such as various aluminium, [[titanium alloy|titanium]], [[nickel alloys|nickel]], and [[magnesium alloy]]s. Some modern [[superalloy]]s, such as [[incoloy]], [[inconel]], and [[hastelloy]], may consist of a multitude of different elements.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Terminology", "paragraphs": "[[File:Inconel gate valve--The-Alloy-Valve-Stockist.JPG|thumb|A gate valve, made from [[Inconel]].]]\n\nAs a noun, the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. When used as a verb, the term refers to the act of mixing a metal with other elements. The primary metal is called the ''base'', the ''matrix'', or the ''[[solvent]]''. The secondary constituents are often called ''solutes''. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms (not counting impurities) such as a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, then it is called a ''binary alloy.'' If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ''ternary alloy.'' An alloy with four constituents is a ''quaternary alloy,'' while a five-part alloy is termed a ''quinary alloy.'' Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a ''system''. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a ''binary system,'' while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ''ternary system''.<ref>Bauccio, Michael (1003) ''ASM metals reference book''. ASM International. {{ISBN|0-87170-478-1}}.</ref>\n\nAn alloy is technically an impure metal, but when referring to alloys, the term ''impurities'' usually denotes undesirable elements. Such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements, but are removed during processing. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form [[iron sulfide]], which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Verhoeven, John D.|title=Steel Metallurgy for the Non-metallurgist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-1-61503-056-9|page=56|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505065853/https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|archivedate=2016-05-05}}</ref> [[Lithium]], [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the [[structural integrity]] of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called \"impure metals\" and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form [[metal oxide]]s; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using [[flux (metallurgy)|fluxes]], chemical additives, or other methods of [[extractive metallurgy]].<ref>Davis, Joseph R. (1993) ''ASM Specialty Handbook: Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys''. ASM International. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0-87170-496-2}}.</ref>\n\nIn practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 [[Karat (purity)|karat]] [[gold]] is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the [[silver]] used in [[jewelry]] and the [[aluminium]] used as a structural building material are also alloys.\n\nThe term \"alloy\" is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an [[aluminium alloy]] are commonly referred to as simply \"[[alloy wheel]]s\", although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys. Steel is such a common alloy that many items made from it, like [[wheel]]s, [[barrel]]s, or [[girder]]s, are simply referred to by the name of the item, assuming it is made of steel. When made from other materials, they are typically specified as such, (i.e.: \"bronze wheel\", \"plastic barrel\", or \"wood girder\").\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-87170-478-1"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Verhoeven, John D."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Steel Metallurgy for the Non-metallurgist"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "ASM International"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-1-61503-056-9"}, {"name": "page", "value": "56"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160505065853/https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2016-05-05"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-0-87170-496-2"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Theory", "paragraphs": "Alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements. The most common and oldest alloying process is performed by heating the base metal beyond its [[melting point]] and then dissolving the solutes into the molten liquid, which may be possible even if the melting point of the solute is far greater than that of the base. For example, in its liquid state, [[titanium]] is a very strong solvent capable of dissolving most metals and elements. In addition, it readily absorbs gases like oxygen and burns in the presence of nitrogen. This increases the chance of contamination from any contacting surface, and so must be melted in vacuum induction-heating and special, water-cooled, copper [[crucible]]s.<ref>''Metals Handbook: Properties and selection'' By ASM International -- ASM International 1978 Page 407</ref> However, some metals and solutes, such as iron and carbon, have very high melting-points and were impossible for ancient people to melt. Thus, alloying (in particular, interstitial alloying) may also be performed with one or more constituents in a gaseous state, such as found in a [[blast furnace]] to make pig iron (liquid-gas), [[nitriding]], [[carbonitriding]] or other forms of [[case hardening]] (solid-gas), or the [[cementation process]] used to make [[blister steel]] (solid-gas). It may also be done with one, more, or all of the constituents in the solid state, such as found in ancient methods of [[pattern welding]] (solid-solid), [[shear steel]] (solid-solid), or [[crucible steel]] production (solid-liquid), mixing the elements via solid-state [[diffusion]].\n\nBy adding another element to a metal, differences in the size of the atoms create internal stresses in the lattice of the metallic crystals; stresses that often enhance its properties. For example, the combination of carbon with iron produces [[steel]], which is stronger than [[iron]], its primary element. The [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as [[density]], [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], [[Young's modulus]] of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as [[tensile strength]],<ref>Mills, Adelbert Phillo (1922) ''Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties'', John Wiley & sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison</ref> ductility, and [[shear strength]] may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the [[atom]]s in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=C.|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|journal=Physical Review|volume=188|issue=2|pages=870\u2013874|year=1969|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|bibcode=1969PhRv..188..870H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=X.|last2=Suhl|first2=H.|title=Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping|journal=Physical Review A|volume=32|pages=2530\u20132533|year=1985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530|pmid=9896377|issue=4|bibcode=1985PhRvA..32.2530Z}}</ref>\nSome alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. [[Bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]], was the first alloy discovered, during the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period now known as the [[Bronze Age]]. It was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]], [[bell]]s, [[statue]]s, and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. [[Brass]] is an alloy made from [[copper]] and [[zinc]].\n\nUnlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single [[melting point]], but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] phases (a slush). The temperature at which melting begins is called the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]], and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the [[liquidus]]. For many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion (in some cases more than one), called either a [[eutectic]] mixture or a peritectic composition, which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point, and no liquid/solid slush transition.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Hogan"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "C."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Physical Review"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "188"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "870\u2013874"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1969"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1103/PhysRev.188.870"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1969PhRv..188..870H"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Zhang"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "X."}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Suhl"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "H."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Physical Review A"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "32"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "2530\u20132533"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1985"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "9896377"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "4"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1985PhRvA..32.2530Z"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Heat-treatable alloys", "paragraphs": "[[File:IronAlfa&IronGamma.svg|thumb|left|[[Allotropes of iron]], ([[alpha iron]] and [[gamma iron]]) showing the differences in atomic arrangement.]]\n[[File:Photomicrograph of annealed and quenched steel, from 1911 Britannica plates 11 and 14.jpg|thumb|Photomicrographs of [[steel]].

Most metals and alloys can be [[work hardening|work hardened]] by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during [[plastic deformation]] by hammering, bending, extruding, et cetera, and are permanent unless the metal is [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallized]]. Otherwise, some alloys can also have their properties altered by [[heat treatment]]. Nearly all metals can be softened by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], and [[nickel]] can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree as does [[steel]].<ref name=\"Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14\"/>\n\nThe base metal iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, undergoes a change in the arrangement ([[allotropy]]) of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between {{convert|1500|F|C}} and {{convert|1600|F|C}}, depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this [[diffusion]] happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in ''[[solid solution|solution]]'' in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called [[austenite]]. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as [[solubility|soluble]] with the iron, and will be forced to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, [[nucleating]] into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called [[cementite]] (or [[carbide]]), and pure iron [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a [[diffusionless transformation|diffusionless (martensite) transformation]] occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).\n\nWhile the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martensite), most heat-treatable alloys are [[precipitation hardening]] alloys, that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming [[intermetallic]] phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases (carbide and ferrite), precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneously, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.<ref name=\"Jon L.

The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a ''substitutional alloy''. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and [[brass]], in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively. \n\nIn the case of the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other and  can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal. Instead, the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms of the crystal matrix, called the ''interstices''. This is referred to as an ''interstitial alloy''. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. \n\n[[Stainless steel]] is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms.<ref name=\"Jon L.

As a pure metal, tin is much too soft to use for most practical purposes. However, during the [[Bronze Age]], tin was a rare metal in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, so it was often valued higher than gold. To make jewellery, cutlery, or other objects from tin, workers usually alloyed it with other metals to increase strength and hardness. These metals were typically [[lead]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]] or copper. These solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of objects, ranging from practical items such as dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips.\n\nThe earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC. The use of pewter was widespread across Europe, from France to Norway and Britain (where most of the ancient tin was mined) to the Near East.<ref>Hull, Charles (1992) ''Pewter''. Shire Publications. pp. 3\u20134; {{ISBN|0-7478-0152-5}}</ref> The alloy was also used in China and the Far East, arriving in Japan around 800 AD, where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels, tea canisters, or chalices used in [[shinto]] shrines.<ref>Brinkley, Frank (1904) ''Japan and China: Japan, its history, arts, and literature''. Oxford University. p. 317</ref>\n\n===Steel and pig iron===\n[[File:Chinese fining.png|thumb|Puddling in China, circa 1637. Opposite to most alloying processes, liquid pig-iron is poured from a blast furnace into a container and stirred to remove carbon, which diffuses into the air forming carbon dioxide, leaving behind a [[mild steel]] to wrought iron.]]\n\nThe first known smelting of iron began in [[Anatolia]], around 1800 BC. Called the [[bloomery|bloomery process]], it produced very soft but [[ductile]] [[wrought iron]]. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. [[Pig iron]], a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and [[carbon]], was being produced in [[History of China#Shang Dynasty (c. 1700\u20131046 BC)|China]] as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making [[cast-iron]]. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of [[crucible steel]] around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of [[pattern welding]], around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove [[slag]] and impurities. This method of [[Japanese swordsmithing]] produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world.<ref name=r1>Smith, Cyril (1960) ''History of metallography''. MIT Press. pp. 2\u20134. {{ISBN|0-262-69120-5}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of [[steel]], (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by [[heat treatment]] had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of [[blister steel]] during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the absorption of carbon in this manner is extremely slow thus the penetration was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of [[tool steel]]. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\">Roberts, George Adam; Krauss, George; Kennedy, Richard and Kennedy, Richard L.

ASM International. pp. 2\u20133. {{ISBN|0-87170-599-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages meant that people could produce [[pig iron]] in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes to reduce carbon in [[liquid]] pig iron to create steel. [[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] had been used in China since the first century, and was introduced in Europe during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by [[oxidation]]. In 1858, [[Henry Bessemer]] developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The [[Bessemer process]] led to the first large scale manufacture of steel.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\"/>\n\n====Alloy steels====\nSteel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but the term ''[[alloy steel]]'' usually only refers to steels that contain other elements\u2014 like [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[cobalt]]\u2014in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times, when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the [[Age of reason]], the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods. For example, the people of [[Sheffield]], a center of steel production in England, were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter [[industrial espionage]]. Thus, almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until 1860. Because of this lack of understanding, steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between 1930 and 1970 (primarily due to the work of scientists like [[William Chandler Roberts-Austen]], [[Adolf Martens]], and [[Edgar Bain]]), so \"alloy steel\" became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel-alloys.<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 57\u201462</ref><ref>''Experimental Techniques in Materials and Mechanics'' By C. Suryanarayana \u2013 CRC Press 2011 p. 202</ref>\n\nAfter Benjamin Huntsman developed his [[crucible steel]] in 1740, he began experimenting with the addition of elements like [[manganese]] (in the form of a high-manganese pig-iron called ''[[spiegeleisen]]''), which helped remove impurities such as phosphorus and oxygen; a process adopted by Bessemer and still used in modern steels (albeit in concentrations low enough to still be considered carbon steel).<ref>''Tool Steels, 5th Edition'' By George Adam Roberts, Richard Kennedy, G. Krauss \u2013 ASM International 1998 p. 4</ref> Afterward, many people began experimenting with various alloys of steel without much success. However, in 1882, [[Robert Hadfield]], being a pioneer in steel metallurgy, took an interest and produced a steel alloy containing around 12% manganese. Called [[mangalloy]], it exhibited extreme hardness and toughness, becoming the first commercially viable alloy-steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bramfitt, B.L.|title=Metallographer's Guide: Practice and Procedures for Irons and Steels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoM8VJHTt24C&pg=PA13|year=2001|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-1-61503-146-7|pages=13\u2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502154559/https://books.google.com/books?id=hoM8VJHTt24C&pg=PA13|archivedate=2016-05-02}}</ref> Afterward, he created [[silicon steel]], launching the search for other possible alloys of steel.<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1987 pp. 57\u201462</ref>\n\n[[Robert Forester Mushet]] found that by adding [[tungsten]] to steel it could produce a very hard edge that would resist losing its hardness at high temperatures. \"R. Mushet's special steel\" (RMS) became the first [[high-speed steel]].<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1987 pp. 66\u201468</ref> Mushet's steel was quickly replaced by [[tungsten carbide]] steel, developed by Taylor and White in 1900, in which they doubled the tungsten content and added small amounts of chromium and vanadium, producing a superior steel for use is lathes and machining tools. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] used a chromium-nickel steel to make the crankshaft for their airplane engine, while in 1908 [[Henry Ford]] began using vanadium steels for parts like crankshafts and valves in his [[Model T Ford]], due to their higher strength and resistance to high temperatures.<ref>''Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist'' by Harry Chandler -- ASM International 1998 Page 3--5</ref> In 1912, the Krupp Ironworks in Germany developed a rust-resistant steel by adding 21% [[chromium]] and 7% [[nickel]], producing the first [[stainless steel]].<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1987 p. 75</ref>\n\n===Aluminium and other nonferrous-alloys===\nNonferrous alloys contain no appreciable amounts of iron. The first alloys, bronze and brass, were used for thousands of years, along with lead alloys, pewter and others\u2014but these were all made from metals that were fairly non-reactive and could be smelted over open flames. In the 18th century, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] helped to establish the oxygen theory of [[combustion]], displacing the defunct [[phlogiston theory]] that had ruled since the late Middle Ages. The oxygen theory helped correctly explain the phenomenon of things like [[oxidation]] of metals (i.e., rust) and how rocky ores transform into metals when heated. Lavoisier predicted that many of the earths, salts, and alkalis\u2014for example in [[alum]], a salt used since antiquity\u2014contained metallic bases that were too reactive to oxygen to smelt by the usual methods. His work eventually led to the [[periodic table of elements]], which helped confirm the existence of these \"missing metals.\"\n\nDue to their high reactivity, most metals were not discovered until the 19th century. A method for extracting aluminium from [[bauxite]] was proposed by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807, using an [[electric arc]]. Although his attempts were unsuccessful, by 1855 the first sales of pure aluminium reached the market. However, as [[extractive metallurgy]] was still in its infancy, most aluminium extraction-processes produced unintended alloys contaminated with other elements found in the ore; the most abundant of which was copper. These aluminium-copper alloys (at the time termed \"aluminum bronze\") preceded pure aluminium, offering greater strength and hardness over the soft, pure metal, and to a slight degree were found to be heat treatable.<ref>''Aluminium: Its History, Occurrence, Properties, Metallurgy and Applications'' by Joseph William Richards -- Henry Cairy Baird & Co 1887 Page 25--42</ref> However, due to their softness and limited hardenability these alloys found little practical use, and were more of a novelty, until the [[Wright brothers]] used an aluminium alloy to construct the first airplane engine in 1903.<ref>''Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist'' by Harry Chandler -- ASM International 1998 Page 3--5</ref> During the time between 1865 and 1910, processes for extracting many other metals were discovered, such as chromium, vanadium, tungsten, [[iridium]], [[cobalt]], and [[molybdenum]], and various alloys were developed.<ref>''Metallurgy: 1863-1963'' by W.H. Dennis -- Routledge 2017</ref>\n\nPrior to 1910, research mainly consisted of private individuals tinkering in their own laboratories. However, as the aircraft and automotive industries began growing, research into alloys became an industrial effort in the years following 1910, as new [[magnesium alloy]]s were developed for pistons and [[alloy wheel|wheels]] in cars, and [[pot metal]] for levers and knobs, and aluminium alloys developed for [[airframe]]s and [[aircraft skin]]s were put into use.<ref>''Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist'' by Harry Chandler -- ASM International 1998 Page 3--5</ref>\n\n===Precipitation-hardening alloys===\nIn 1906, [[precipitation hardening]] alloys were discovered by [[Alfred Wilm]]. Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when [[quenching|quenched]] (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. Wilm had been searching for a way to harden aluminium alloys for use in machine-gun cartridge cases. Knowing that aluminium-copper alloys were heat-treatable to some degree, Wilm tried quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and the addition of [[magnesium]], but was initially disappointed with the results. However, when Wilm retested it the next day he discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature, and far exceeded his expectations. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, [[duralumin]] was one of the first \"age hardening\" alloys used, becoming the primary building material for the first [[Zeppelin]]s, and was soon followed by many others.<ref>''Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist'' by Harry Chandler -- ASM International 1998 Page 1--3</ref> Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern [[aircraft]].<ref>Jacobs, M.H.

As a pure metal, tin is much too soft to use for most practical purposes. However, during the [[Bronze Age]], tin was a rare metal in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, so it was often valued higher than gold. To make jewellery, cutlery, or other objects from tin, workers usually alloyed it with other metals to increase strength and hardness. These metals were typically [[lead]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]] or copper. These solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of objects, ranging from practical items such as dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips.\n\nThe earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC.

Called the [[bloomery|bloomery process]], it produced very soft but [[ductile]] [[wrought iron]]. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. [[Pig iron]], a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and [[carbon]], was being produced in [[History of China#Shang Dynasty (c. 1700\u20131046 BC)|China]] as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making [[cast-iron]]. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of [[crucible steel]] around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of [[pattern welding]], around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove [[slag]] and impurities. This method of [[Japanese swordsmithing]] produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world.<ref name=r1>Smith, Cyril (1960) ''History of metallography''.

However, very small amounts of [[steel]], (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by [[heat treatment]] had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of [[blister steel]] during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the absorption of carbon in this manner is extremely slow thus the penetration was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of [[tool steel]]. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\">Roberts, George Adam; Krauss, George; Kennedy, Richard and Kennedy, Richard L.

Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes to reduce carbon in [[liquid]] pig iron to create steel. [[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] had been used in China since the first century, and was introduced in Europe during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by [[oxidation]]. In 1858, [[Henry Bessemer]] developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The [[Bessemer process]] led to the first large scale manufacture of steel.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\"/>\n\n====Alloy steels====\nSteel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but the term ''[[alloy steel]]'' usually only refers to steels that contain other elements\u2014 like [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[cobalt]]\u2014in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times, when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets.

For example, the people of [[Sheffield]], a center of steel production in England, were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter [[industrial espionage]].

In the 18th century, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] helped to establish the oxygen theory of [[combustion]], displacing the defunct [[phlogiston theory]] that had ruled since the late Middle Ages. The oxygen theory helped correctly explain the phenomenon of things like [[oxidation]] of metals (i.e., rust) and how rocky ores transform into metals when heated. Lavoisier predicted that many of the earths, salts, and alkalis\u2014for example in [[alum]], a salt used since antiquity\u2014contained metallic bases that were too reactive to oxygen to smelt by the usual methods. His work eventually led to the [[periodic table of elements]], which helped confirm the existence of these \"missing metals.\"\n\nDue to their high reactivity, most metals were not discovered until the 19th century. A method for extracting aluminium from [[bauxite]] was proposed by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807, using an [[electric arc]]. Although his attempts were unsuccessful, by 1855 the first sales of pure aluminium reached the market. However, as [[extractive metallurgy]] was still in its infancy, most aluminium extraction-processes produced unintended alloys contaminated with other elements found in the ore; the most abundant of which was copper. These aluminium-copper alloys (at the time termed \"aluminum bronze\") preceded pure aluminium, offering greater strength and hardness over the soft, pure metal, and to a slight degree were found to be heat treatable.<ref>''Aluminium: Its History, Occurrence, Properties, Metallurgy and Applications'' by Joseph William Richards -- Henry Cairy Baird & Co 1887 Page 25--42</ref> However, due to their softness and limited hardenability these alloys found little practical use, and were more of a novelty, until the [[Wright brothers]] used an aluminium alloy to construct the first airplane engine in 1903.<ref>''Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist'' by Harry Chandler -- ASM International 1998 Page 3--5</ref> During the time between 1865 and 1910, processes for extracting many other metals were discovered, such as chromium, vanadium, tungsten, [[iridium]], [[cobalt]], and [[molybdenum]], and various alloys were developed.<ref>''Metallurgy: 1863-1963'' by W.H.
