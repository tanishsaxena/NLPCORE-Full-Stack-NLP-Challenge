In 1883, Menger published ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', which attacked the methods of the historical school. [[Gustav von Schmoller]], a leader of the historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term \"Austrian School\" in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial.<ref>\"Menger's approach \u2013 haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, as merely \"Austrian,\" the origin of that label \u2013 led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in Europe and, later, in the United States.\" [[Peter G.

[[Carl Menger]]'s 1871 book ''[[Principles of Economics (Menger)|Principles of Economics]]'' is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of [[marginal utility]]. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics.<ref name=keizer>{{cite book |last=Keizer |first=Willem |title=Austrian Economics in Debate |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-14054-6 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2011}} While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the \"Psychological School\", \"Vienna School\", or \"Austrian School\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kirzner | first1 = Israel M. | year = 1987 | title = Austrian School of Economics | url = | journal = [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]] | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 145\u201351 }}</ref>\n\nMenger's contributions to economic theory were closely followed by those of [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]. These three economists became what is known as the \"first wave\" of the Austrian School. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of [[Karl Marx]] in the 1880s and 1890s as was part of the Austrians' participation in the late 19th-century ''[[Methodenstreit]]'', during which they attacked the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] doctrines of the [[Historical school of economics|historical school]].\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[Frank Albert Fetter]] (1863\u20131949) was a leader in the United States of Austrian thought.

Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard. Austrian economist [[Walter Block]] says that the Austrian School can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories\u2014economic theory and political theory. According to Block, while Hayek can be considered an Austrian economist, his views on political theory clash with the libertarian political theory which Block sees as an integral part of the Austrian School.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Walter Block: Austrian vs Chicago Schools|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiX7dzyHkK4|publisher=Mises Canada : Rothbard School 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518134054/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiX7dzyHkK4|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, both criticisms from Hoppe and Block to Hayek seem to also apply to the founder of the Austrian School Carl Menger. Hoppe emphasizes that Hayek, which for him is from the English empirical tradition, is an opponent of the supposed rationalist tradition of the Austrian School, but Menger made strong critiques to rationalism in his works in similar vein as Hayek's. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|title=Investigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences|last=Menger|first=Carl|pages=173\u2013175|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155554/https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|archivedate=2017-02-11}}</ref> He emphasized the idea that there are several institutions which were not deliberately created, have a kind of \"superior wisdom\" and serve important functions to society.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|title=Investigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences|last=Menger|first=Carl|pages=146\u2013147|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155554/https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|archivedate=2017-02-11}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|title=Investigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences|last=Menger|first=Carl|pages=91|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155554/https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&type=document|archivedate=2017-02-11}}</ref> He also talked about Burke and the English tradition to sustain these positions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen saying that the libertarian political theory is an integral part of the Austrian School and supposing Hayek is not a libertarian, Block excludes Menger from the Austrian School too since Menger seems to defend broader state activity than Hayek\u2014for example, progressive taxation and extensive labour legislation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.hetsa.org.au/hetsa2009/conference_papers/7.%20Yukihiro%20Ikeda%20Carl%20Menger's%20Liberalism%20Revisited.pdf|title=Carl Menger's Liberalism Revisited|last=Ikeda|first=Yukihiro|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216010338/http://hetsa.org.au/hetsa2009/conference_papers/7.%20Yukihiro%20Ikeda%20Carl%20Menger's%20Liberalism%20Revisited.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-16}}</ref>\n\nEconomists of the Hayekian view are affiliated with the [[Cato Institute]], [[George Mason University]] (GMU) and New York University, among other institutions.

Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard.

Hayek stated that market prices reflect information, the totality of which is not known to any single individual, which determines the allocation of resources in an economy. Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and [[price discovery]] processes by which individuals act on their personal information, Hayek argued that socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge required to make optimal decisions.  Those who agree with this criticism view it as a refutation of socialism, showing that socialism is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization. The debate rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as the socialist calculation debate.<ref name=\"School\">[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm The socialist calculation debate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218142504/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm |date=February 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMises argued in a 1920 essay \"[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]\" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if the government owned the [[means of production]], then no prices could be obtained for [[capital good]]s as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not \"objects of exchange\", unlike final goods.

Hayek stated that market prices reflect information, the totality of which is not known to any single individual, which determines the allocation of resources in an economy. Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and [[price discovery]] processes by which individuals act on their personal information, Hayek argued that socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge required to make optimal decisions.  Those who agree with this criticism view it as a refutation of socialism, showing that socialism is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization. The debate rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as the socialist calculation debate.<ref name=\"School\">[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm The socialist calculation debate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218142504/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm |date=February 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMises argued in a 1920 essay \"[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]\" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if the government owned the [[means of production]], then no prices could be obtained for [[capital good]]s as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not \"objects of exchange\", unlike final goods.
