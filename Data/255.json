Aberdeen itself forms a different council area (Aberdeen City). Aberdeenshire borders onto [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]] to the south, [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] and [[Moray]] to the west and Aberdeen City to the east.\n\nTraditionally, it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and forestry) and related processing industries. Over the last 40 years, the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire's economic base, and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50% since 1975.<ref name=\"Aberdeenshire Profile 2012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council \u2013 Profile 2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223911/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Its land represents 8% of Scotland's overall territory.
