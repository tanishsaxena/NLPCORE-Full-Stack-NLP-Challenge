His subsequent failure to meet with and take seriously the complaints from Luther, his failure to inform Rome of the seriousness of the situation and finally Rome's refusal to act properly faced with the situation, forced Luther to more serious action. These failures to respond adequately make him notable for his failure to prevent the [[Reformation]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more footnotes", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2012"}]}, {"name": "Infobox Christian leader\n", "values": [{"name": "type", "value": "Archbishop"}, {"name": "name", "value": "Albert of Brandenburg"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archbishop of Mainz"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Cranach - Albert of Hohenzollern.JPG"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Albert of Mainz, painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in 1526"}, {"name": "church", "value": "[[Catholic Church]]"}, {"name": "diocese", "value": "[[Electorate of Mainz]]"}, {"name": "term", "value": "1514\u20131545"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "<!--   Orders   -->"}, {"name": "rank", "value": "<!--   Personal details   -->"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "28 June 1490"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "24 September 1545"}]}, {"name": "lang-de", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Albrecht von Brandenburg"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Biography", "paragraphs": "=== Early career ===\nBorn in [[K\u00f6lln]] on the Spree, Albert was the younger son of [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg]] and of [[Margaret of Thuringia]].\n\nAfter their father's funeral, Albert and his older brother [[Joachim I Nestor]] became [[Margrave of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] in 1499, but only his older brother held the title of an [[elector of Brandenburg]].
