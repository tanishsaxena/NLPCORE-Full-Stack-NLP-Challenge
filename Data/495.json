Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day [[Afghanistan]] in the west to [[Bangladesh]] in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. The empire's capital was [[Pataliputra]] (in [[Magadha]], present-day [[Patna]]), with provincial capitals at [[Taxila]] and [[Ujjain]].\n\nAshoka waged a destructive war against the state of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Odisha]]),{{sfn|Bentley|1993|p=44}} which he conquered in about 260 BCE.<ref>[[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] had been conquered by the preceding [[Nanda Dynasty]] but subsequently broke free until it was reconquered by Ashoka c. 260 BCE. (Raychaudhuri, H. C.; Mukherjee, B. N. 1996. ''Political History of Ancient India: From the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of the Gupta Dynasty''. Oxford University Press, pp. 204\u20139, pp. 270\u201371)</ref> In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism{{sfn|Bentley|1993|p=44}} after witnessing the mass deaths of the [[Kalinga War]], which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations.{{sfn|Bentley|1993|p=45}} He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Central Asia]], and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of [[Gautama Buddha]].{{sfn|Bentley|1993|p=46}}\n\nBeyond the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (\"''Narrative of Ashoka''\", a part of the ''[[Divyavadana]]''), and in the Sri Lankan text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (\"''Great Chronicle''\"). The emblem of the modern [[Republic of India]] is an adaptation of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]. His [[Sanskrit]] name \"{{IAST|A\u015boka}}\" means \"painless, without sorrow\" (the [[a privativum|''a'' privativum]] and ''\u015boka'', \"pain, distress\"). In his [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]], he is referred to as ''{{IAST|Dev\u0101n\u0101mpriya}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Dev\u0101na\u1e43piya}}'' or \"the Beloved of the Gods\"), and ''{{IAST|Priyadar\u015bin}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|[[Piyadas\u012b]]}}'' or \"He who regards everyone with affection\"). His fondness for his name's connection to the ''[[Saraca asoca]]'' tree, or  \"Ashoka tree\", is also referenced in the ''Ashokavadana''.\n\nIn ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1920), [[H.G.

Strong]], it is sometimes useful to think of Ashoka's messages as propaganda by a politician whose aim is to present a favourable image of himself and his administration, rather than record historical facts.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=141}}\n\nA small number of other inscriptions also provide some information about Ashoka.{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=132}} For example, he finds a mention in the 2nd century [[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman]].{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=8}} [[Aramaic Inscription of Taxila|An inscription]] discovered at [[Sirkap]] mentions a lost word beginning with \"Priy\", which is theorised to be Ashoka's title \"Priyadarshi\", although this is not certain.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=7}} Some other inscriptions, such as the [[Sohgaura copper plate inscription]], have been tentatively dated to Ashoka's period by a section of scholars, although this is contested by others.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n'''Buddhist legends'''\n\nMuch of the information about Ashoka comes from Buddhist legends, which present him as a great, ideal king.{{sfn|Singh|2008|pp=331\u2013332}} These legends appear in texts that are not contemporary to Ashoka, and were composed by Buddhist authors, who used various stories to illustrate the impact of their faith on Ashoka. This makes it necessary to exercise caution while relying on them for historical information.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|pp=8\u20139}} Among modern scholars, opinions range from downright dismissal of these legends as mythological to acceptance of all historical portions that seem plausible.{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=12}}\n\nThe Buddhist legends about Ashoka exist in several languages, including [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], and [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]]. All these legends can be traced to two primary traditions:{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n\n* the North Indian tradition preserved in the Sanskrit-language texts such as ''[[Divyavadana]]'' (including its constituent ''[[Ashokavadana]]''); and Chinese sources such as ''A-y\u00fc wang chuan'' and ''A-y\u00fc wang ching''.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n* the Sri Lankan tradition preserved in Pali-lanuage texts, such as ''[[Dipavamsa]]'', ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', ''Vamsatthapakasini'' (a commentary on ''Mahavamsa''), Buddhaghosha's commentary on the Vinaya, and ''Samanta-pasadika''.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=8}}\n\nThere are several major differences between the two traditions. For example, the Sri Lankan tradition emphasises Ashoka's role in convening the [[Third Buddhist council]], and his dispatch of several missionaries to distant regions, including his son Mahinda to Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} However, the North Indian tradition makes no mention of these events, and describes other events not found in the Sri Lankan tradition, such as a story about another son named Kunala.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=144}}\n\nEven while narrating the common stories, the two traditions diverge in several ways. For example, both ''Ashokavadana'' and ''Mahavamsa'' mention that Ashoka's queen [[Tishyarakshita]] had the [[Bodhi Tree]] destroyed. In ''Ashokavadana'', the queen manages to have the tree healed after she realises her mistake. In the ''Mahavamsa'', she permanently destroys the tree, but only after a branch of the three has been transplanted in Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|pp=152\u2013154}} In another story, both the texts describe Ashoka's unsuccessful attempts to collect a relic of Gautama Buddha from [[Ramagrama stupa|Ramagrama]]. In ''Ashokavadana'', he fails to do so because he cannot match the devotion of the Nagas who hold the relic; however, in the ''Mahavamsa'', he fails to do so because the Buddha had destined the relic to be enshrined by king [[Dutthagamani]] of Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=155}} Using such stories, the ''Mahavamsa'' glorifies Sri Lanka as the new preserve of Buddhism.{{sfn|Strong|1995|pp=154\u2013157}}\n\n[[File:013 King Asoka visits Ramagrama (33428090870).jpg|thumb|800px|center|King Ashoka visits Ramagrama, to take relics of the Buddha from the [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]], but in vain. Southern gateway, Stupa 1, [[Sanchi]].{{sfn|Singh|2017|p=162}}]]\n\n'''Other sources'''\n\nNumismatic, sculptural, and archaeological evidence supplements research on Ashoka.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=11}} Ashoka's name appears in the lists of Mauryan kings in the various [[Puranas]], but these texts do not provide further details about him, as their [[Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] authors were not patronised by the Mauryans.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=15}} Other texts, such as the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' and ''[[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica of Megasthenes]]'', which provide general information about the Maurya period, can also be used to make inferences about Ashoka's reign.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=9}} However, the ''Arthashastra'' is a normative text that focuses on an ideal rather than a historical state, and its dating to the Mauryan period is a subject of debate. The ''Indica'' is a [[lost work]], and only parts of it survive in form of paraphrases in later writings.{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=132}}\n\nThe 12th-century text ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' mentions a [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] king [[Ashoka (Gonandiya)|Ashoka of Gonandiya dynasty]] who built several [[stupa]]s: some scholars, such as [[Aurel Stein]], have identified this king with the Maurya king Ashoka; others, such as [[Ananda W.

of his inscription shows that Piyadasi ruled a vast Empire, contiguous with the [[Seleucid Empire]] in the West.<ref name=\"CIB226\"/> \n\nOn the contrary, for Beckwith, Ashoka himself was a later

explicitly promoting Buddhism.<ref name=\"CIB226\"/> His inscriptions cover a very different and much smaller geographical area, clustering in Central India.<ref name=\"CIB226\"/> According to

Therefore, he instigated five hundred ministers to support Ashoka's claim to the throne when the time came, noting that Ashoka was predicted to become a ''[[chakravartin]]'' (universal ruler).{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=102}} Sometime later, Takshashila rebelled again, and Bindusara dispatched Susima to curb the rebellion. Shortly after, Bindusara fell extremely ill, and expected to die soon. Susima was still in Takshashila, having been unsuccessful in suppressing the rebellion. Bindusara recalled him to the capital, and asked Ashoka to march to Takshashila.{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=209}} However, the ministers told him that Ashoka was ill, and suggested that he temporarily install Ashoka on the throne until Susmia's return from Takshashila.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=102}} When Bindusara refused to do so, Ashoka declared that if the throne was rightfully his, the gods would crown him as the next king.

After his father's death, Ashoka had his eldest brother killed, and ascended the throne.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=101}} The text also states that Ashoka killed ninety-nine of his half-brothers, including Sumana.{{sfn|Guruge|1993|p=28}} The ''Dipavamsa'' states that he killed a hundred of his brothers, and was crowned four years later.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=102}} The ''Vamsatthapakasini'' adds that an Ajivika ascetic had predicted this massacre based on the interpretation of a dream of Ashoka's mother.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=26}} According to these accounts, only Ashoka's uterine brother Tissa was spared.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=27}} Other sources name the surviving brother Vitashoka, Vigatashoka, Sudatta (So-ta-to in ''A-yi-uang-chuan''), or Sugatra (Siu-ka-tu-lu in ''Fen-pie-kung-te-hun'').{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=27}}\n\nThe figures such as 99 and 100 are exaggerated, and seem to be a way of stating that Ashoka killed several of his brothers.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=102}} Taranatha states that Ashoka, who was an illegitimate son of his predecessor, killed six legitimate princes to ascend the throne.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|pp=25\u201326}} It is possible that Ashoka was not the rightful heir to the throne, and killed a brother (or brothers) to acquire the throne.

Eggermont explains this anamoly by theorising that Ashoka had his own interpretation of the \"[[Middle Way]]\".{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=33}}\n\nSome earlier writers believed that Ashoka ''dramatically'' converted to Buddhism after seeing the suffering caused by the war, since his Major Rock Edict 13 states that he became closer to the dhamma after the annexation of Kalinga.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=18}} However, even if Ashoka converted to Buddhism ''after'' the war, epigraphic evidence suggests that his conversion was a ''gradual'' process rather than a dramatic event.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=18}} For example, in a Minor Rock Edict issued during his 13th regnal year (five years after the Kalinga campaign), he states that he had been an ''[[upasaka]]'' (lay Buddhist) for more than two and a half years, but did not make much progress; in the past year, he was drawn closer to the sangha, and became a more ardent follower.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=18}}\n\n=== The war ===\n\nAccording to Ashoka's Major Rock Edict 13, he conquered Kalinga 8 years after his ascension to the throne. The edict states that during his conquest of Kalinga, 100,000 men and animals were killed in action; many times that number \"perished\"; and 150,000 men and animals were carried away from Kalinga as captives. Ashoka states that the repentance of these sufferings caused him to devote himself to the practice and propagation of dharma.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=38}} He proclaims that he now considered the slaughter, death and deportation caused during the conquest of a country painful and deplorable; and that he considered the suffering caused to the religious people and householders even more deplorable.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=38}}\n\nThis edict has been found inscribed at several places, including Erragudi, Girnar, Kalsi, Maneshra, Shahbazgarhi and Kandahar.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=37}} However, is omitted in Ashoka's inscriptions found in the Kalinga region, where the Rock Edicts 13 and 14 have been replaced by two separate edicts that make no mention of Ashoka's remorse. It is possible that Ashoka did not consider it politically appropriate to make such a confession to the people of Kalinga.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|pp=30\u201331}} Another possibility is the Kalinga war and its consequences, as described in Ashoka's rock edicts, are \"more imaginary than real\": this description is meant to impress those far removed from the scene, and thus, unable to verify its accuracy.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=56}}\n\nAncient sources do not mention any other military activity of Ashoka, although the 16th century writer [[Taranatha]] claims that Ashoka conquered the entire Jambudvipa.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=36}}\n\n=== First contact with Buddhism ===\n\nDifferent sources give different accounts of Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=29}}\n\nAccording to Sri Lankan tradition, Ashoka's father Bindusara was a devotee of [[Brahmanism]], and his mother Dharma was a devotee of [[Ajivika]]s.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=42}} The ''[[Samantapasadika]]'' states that Ashoka followed non-Buddhist sects during the first three years of his reign.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=43}} The Sri Lankan texts add that Ashoka was not happy with the behaviour of the Brahmins who received his alms daily. His courtiers produced some Ajivika and Nigantha teachers before him, but these also failed to impress him.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=47}}\n\nThe ''Dipavamsa'' states that Ashoka invited several non-Buddhist religious leaders to his palace, and bestowed great gifts upon them in hope that they would be able to answer a question posed by the king. The text does not state what the question was, but mentions that none of the invitees were able to answer it.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=109}} One day, Ashoka saw a young Buddhist monk called Nigrodha (or Nyagrodha), who was looking for alms on a road in Pataliputra.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=109}} He was the king's nephew, although the king was not aware of this:{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=7}} he was a posthumous son of Ashoka's eldest brother Sumana, whom Ashoka had killed during the conflict for the throne.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=34}} Ashoka was impressed by Nigrodha's tranquil and fearless appearance, and asked him to teach him his faith. In response, Nigrodha offered him a sermon on [[appamada]] (earnestness).{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=109}} Impressed by the sermon, Ashoka offered Nigrodha 400,000 silver coins and 8 daily portions of rice.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=110}} The king became a Buddhist upasaka, and started visiting the [[Kukkutarama]] shrine at Pataliputra. At the temple, he met the Buddhist monk [[Moggaliputta Tissa]], and became more devoted to the Buddhist faith.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=47}} The veracity of this story is not certain.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=110}} This legend about Ashoka's search for a worthy teacher may be aimed at explaining why Ashoka did not adopt Jainism, another major contemporary faith that advocates non-violence and compassion. The legend suggests that Ashoka was not attracted to Buddhism because he was looking for such a faith, rather, for a competent spiritual teacher.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=108}} The Sri Lankan tradition adds that during his 6th regnal year, Ashoka's son Mahinda became a Buddhist monk, and his daughter became a Buddhist nun.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=49}}\n\nA story in ''Divyavadana'' attributes Ashoka's conversion to the Buddhist monk Samudra, who was an ex-merchant from Shravasti. According to this account, Samudra was imprisoned in Ashoka's \"Hell\", but saved himself using his miraculous powers. When Ashoka heard about this, he visited the monk, and was further impressed by a series of miracles performed by the monk. He then became a Buddhist.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=35}} A story in the ''Ashokavadana'' states that Samudra was a merchant's son, and was a 12-year-old boy when he met Ashoka; this account seems to be influenced by the Nigrodha story.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=36}}\n\nThe A-yu-wang-chuan states that a 7-year-old Buddhist converted Ashoka. Another story claims that the young boy ate 500 [[Brahmins|Brahmanas]] who were harassing Ashoka for being interested in Buddhism; these Brahmanas later miraculously turned into Buddhist [[bhikku]]s at the Kukkutarama monastery, where Ashoka paid a visit.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=35}}\n\nSeveral Buddhist establishments existed in various parts of India by the time of Ashoka's ascension. It is not clear which branch of the Buddhist sangha influenced him, but the one at his capital [[Pataliputra]] is a good candidate.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=135}} Another good candidate is the one at [[Mahabodhi Temple|Mahabodhi]]: the Major Rock Edict 8 records his visit to the [[Bodhi Tree]] \u2013 the place of Buddha's enlightenment at Mahabodhi \u2013 after his 10th regnal year, and the minor rock edict issued during his 13th regnal year suggests that he had become a Buddhist around the same time.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=135}}{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=18}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Indian Archaeology 1997-98"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "ASI"}, {"name": "page", "value": "Plate 72"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://nmma.nic.in/nmma/nmma_doc/Indian%20Archaeology%20Review/Indian%20Archaeology%201997-98%20A%20Review.pdf"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "49\u201350"}]}, {"name": "Quote\n", "values": [{"name": "text", "value": "Directly after the Kalingas had been annexed began His Sacred Majesty\u2019s zealous protection of the Law of Piety, his love of that Law, and his inculcation of that Law.

It is not clear which branch of the Buddhist sangha influenced him, but the one at his capital [[Pataliputra]] is a good candidate.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=135}} Another good candidate is the one at [[Mahabodhi Temple|Mahabodhi]]: the Major Rock Edict 8 records his visit to the [[Bodhi Tree]] \u2013 the place of Buddha's enlightenment at Mahabodhi \u2013 after his 10th regnal year, and the minor rock edict issued during his 13th regnal year suggests that he had become a Buddhist around the same time.{{sfn|Lahiri|2015|p=135}}{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=18}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "29"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "42"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "43"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "47"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "109"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "109"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "7"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "34"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "109"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "110"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "47"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "110"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "108"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "49"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "35"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "36"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "35"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "135"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lahiri"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "p", "value": "135"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "18"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": " Reign after Buddhist influence ", "paragraphs": "\n=== Stupas ===\n[[File:Pipal tree temple of Bodh Gaya depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the original temple built by Asoka at Bodh-Gaya on the location of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]], sculpture of the [[Satavahana]] period at [[Sanchi]], 1st century CE.

The central stupa was built during the Mauryas, and enlarged during the [[Sungas]], but the decorative gateway is dated to the later dynasty of the [[Satavahanas]]. ]]\n\nBoth ''Mahavamsa'' and ''Ashokavadana'' state that Ashoka constructed 84,000 stupas or viharas.{{sfn|Strong|1995|pp=154\u2013155}} According to the ''Mahavamsa'', this activity took place during his 5th\u20137th regnal years.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=49}}\n\nThe ''Ashokavadana'' states that Ashoka collected seven out of the eight relics of Gautama Buddha, and had their portions kept in 84,000 boxes made of gold, silver, [[cymophane|cat's eye]], and crystal. He ordered construction of 84,000 stupas throughout the earth, in towns that had a population of 100,000 or more. He told Elder Yashas, a monk at the Kukkutarama monastery, that he wanted these stupas to be completed on the same day. Yashas stated that he would signal the completion time by eclipsing the sun with his hand. When he did so, the 84,000 stupas were completed at once.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=155}}\n\nThe ''Mahavamsa'' states that Ashoka ordered construction of 84,000 viharas (monasteries) rather than the stupas to house the relics.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=158}} Like ''Ashokavadana'', the ''Mahavamsa'' describes Ashoka's collection of the relics, but does not mention this episode in the context of the construction activities.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=158}} It states that Ashoka decided to construct the 84,000 viharas when Moggaliputta Tissa told him that there were 84,000 sections of the Buddha's Dhamma.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=159}} Ashoka himself began the construction of the Ashokarama vihara, and ordered subordinate kings to build the other viharas. Ashokarama was completed by the miraculous power of Thera Indagutta, and the news about the completion of the 84,000 viharas arrived from various cities on the same day.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=155}}\n\nThe number 84,000 is an obvious exaggeration, and it appears that in the later period, the construction of almost every old stupa was attributed to Ashoka.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nThe construction of following stupas and viharas is credited to Ashoka:{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n* [[Sanchi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India\n* [[Dhamek Stupa]], [[Sarnath]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India\n* [[Mahabodhi Temple]], [[Bihar]], India\n* [[Barabar Caves]], [[Bihar]], India\n* [[Nalanda]] Mahavihara (some portions like Sariputta Stupa), [[Bihar]], India\n* [[Taxila]] University (some portions like [[Dharmarajika]] Stupa and Kunala Stupa), [[Taxila]], Pakistan\n* [[Bhir Mound]] (''reconstructed''), [[Taxila]], Pakistan\n* [[Bharhut]] [[stupa]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India\n* [[Deorkothar]] Stupa, [[Madhya Pradesh]], India\n* [[Butkara Stupa]], [[Swat, Pakistan]]\n* [[Sannati]] Stupa, [[Karnataka]], India\n* Mir Rukun Stupa, [[Nawabshah]], [[Pakistan]]\n\n=== Propagation of dhamma ===\n\nAshoka's rock edicts suggest that during his 8th\u20139th regnal years, he made a pilgrimage to the Bodhi Tree, started propagating dhamma, and performed social welfare activities. The welfare activities included establishment of medical treatment facilities for humans and animals; plantation of medicinal herbs; and digging of wells and plantation of trees along the roads. These activities were conducted in the neighbouring kingdoms, including those of the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satiyaputras, Tamraparni, the Greek kingdom of Antiyoka.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\nThe edicts also state that during his 10th\u201311th regnal years, Ashoka became closer to the Buddhist sangha, and went on a tour of the empire that lasted for at least 256 days.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\nBy his 12th regnal year, Ashoka had started inscribing edicts to propagate dhamma, having ordered his officers (''rajjukas'' and ''pradesikas'') to tour their jurisdictions every five years for inspection and for preaching ''dhamma''. By the next year, he had set up the post of the ''dharma-mahamatra''.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\nDuring his 14th regnal year, he commissioned the enlargement of the stupa of Buddha Kanakamuni.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\n=== Third Buddhist Council ===\n[[Image:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 014 King Asoka at the Third Council (9241725897).jpg|thumb|Ashoka and Monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] at the [[Third Buddhist Council]]. Nava Jetavana, [[Shravasti]].]]\nThe Sri Lankan tradition presents a greater role for Ashoka in the Buddhist community.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} In this tradition, Ashoka starts feeding monks on a large scale. His lavish patronage to the state patronage leads to many fake monks joining the sangha. The true Buddhist monks refuse to co-operate with these fake monks, and therefore, no [[uposatha]] ceremony is held for seven years. The king attempts to eradicate the fake monks, but during this attempt, an over-zealous minister ends up killing some real monks. The king then invites the elder monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]], to help him expel non-Buddhists from the monastery founded by him at Pataliputra.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=7}} 60,000 monks ([[bhikkhu]]s) convicted of being heretical are de-frocked in the ensuing process.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} The uposatha ceremony is then held, and Tissa subsequently organises the [[Third Buddhist council]],{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=8}} during the 17th regnal year of Ashoka.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}} Tissa compiles ''[[Kathavatthu]]'', a text that reaffirms Theravadin orthodoxy on several points.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=8}}\n\nThe North Indian tradition makes no mention of these events, which has led to doubts about the historicity of the Third Buddihst council.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=144}}\n\n[[Richard Gombrich]] argues that the non-corroboration of this story by inscriptional evidence cannot be used to dismiss it as completely unhistorical, as several of Ashoka's inscriptions may have been lost.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=8}} Gombrich also argues that Asohka's inscriptions prove that he was interested in maintaining the \"unanimity and purity\" of the Sangha.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=8\u20139}} For example, in his Minor Rock Edict 3, Ashoka recommends the members of the Sangha to study certain texts (most of which remain unidentified). Similarly, in an inscription found at Sanchi, Sarnath, and Kosam, Ashoka mandates that the dissident members of the sangha should be expelled, and expresses his desire to the Sangha remain united and flourish.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=5}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=45}}\n\nThe 8th century Buddhist pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] records another story about Ashoka's involvement in the Buddhist sangha. According to this story, the earlier king [[Bimbisara]], who was a contemporary of the Gautama Buddha, once saw 18 fragments of a cloth and a stick in a dream. The Buddha interpreted the dream to mean that his philosophy would be divided into 18 schools after his death, and predicted that a king called Ashoka would unite these schools over a hundred years later.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=26}}\n\n=== Buddhist missions ===\n\nIn the Sri Lankan tradition, [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] \u2013 who is patronised by Ashoka \u2013 sends out nine Buddhist missions to spread Buddhism in the \"border areas\" in c. 250 BCE. This tradition does not credit Ashoka directly with sending these missions. Each mission comprises five monks, and is headed by an elder.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} To Sri Lanka, he sent his own son Mahinda, accompanied by four other Theras \u2013 Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n\nThe Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\n* Mahinda to Sri Lanka\n* Majjhantika to Kashmir and Gandhara\n* Mahadeva to Mahisa-mandala (possibly modern Mysore region)\n* Rakkhita to Vanavasa\n* Dhammarakkhita the Greek to Aparantaka (western India)\n* Maha-dhamma-rakkhita to Maharashtra\n* Maharakkhita to the Greek country\n* Majjhima to the Himalayas\n* So\u1e47a and Uttara to Suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi (possibly Lower Burma and Thailand)\n\nThe tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\nThe North Indian tradition makes no mention of these events.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=144}} Ashoka's own inscriptions also appear to omit any mention of these events, recording only one of his activities during this period: in his 19th regnal year, he donated the Khalatika Cave to ascetics to provide them a shelter during the rainy season. Ashoka's [[Minor Pillar Edicts|Pillar Edicts]] suggest that during the next year, he made pilgrimage to Lumbini \u2013 the place of Buddha's birth, and to the stupa of the Buddha Kanakamuni.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\nThe Rock Edict XIII states that Ashoka's won a \"dhamma victory\" by sending messengers to five kings and several other kingdoms. Whether these missions correspond to the Buddhist missions recorded in the Buddhist chronicles is debated.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=6}} Indologist [[Etienne Lamotte]] argues that the \"dhamma\" missionaries mentioned in Ashoka's inscriptions were probably not Buddhist monks, as this \"dhamma\" was not same as \"Buddhism\".{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=10\u201311}} Moreover, the lists of destinations of the missions and the dates of the missions mentioned in the inscriptions do not tally the ones mentioned in the Buddhist legends.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}}\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}} According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the ''Vinaya Nidana'' mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at [[Bhilsa]] (near [[Vidisha]]). These caskets have been dated to early 2nd century BCE, and the inscription states that the monks are of the Himalayan school.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} The missions may have set out from Vidisha in central India, as the caskets were discovered there, and as Mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nAccording to Gombrich, the mission may have included representatives of other religions, and thus, Lamotte's objection about \"dhamma\" is not valid. The Buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non-Buddhists, so as not to sideline Buddhism.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}} Frauwallner and Gombrich also believe that Ashoka was directly responsible for the missions, since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities. The Sri Lankan chronicles, which belong to the Theravada school, exaggerate the role of the Theravadin monk Moggaliputta-Tissa in order to glorify their sect.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}}\n\nSome historians argue that Buddhism became a major religion because of Ashoka's royal patronage.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=32}} However, epigraphic evidence suggests that the spread of Buddhism in north-western India and Deccan region was less because of Ashoka's missions, and more because of merchants, traders, landowners and the artisan guilds who supported Buddhist establishments.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=36}}\n\n=== Violence after conversion ===\n\nAccording to the ''Ashokavadana'', Ashoka resorted to violence even after converting to Buddhism. For example:{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=149}}\n\n* He slowly tortured Chandagirika to death in the \"hell\" prison.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=149}}\n* He ordered a massacre of 18,000 heretics for a misdeed of one.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=149}}\n* He launched a pogrom against the Jains, announcing a bounty on the head of any heretic; this results in the beheading of his own brother \u2013 Vitashoka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=149}}\n\nAccording to the ''Ashokavadana'', a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of the Nirgrantha leader Jnatiputra. The term nirgrantha (\"free from bonds\") was originally used for a pre-Jaina ascetic order, but later came to be used for Jaina monks.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=28}} \"Jnatiputra\" is identified with [[Mahavira]], 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]]. The legend states that on complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest the non-Buddhist artist, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ajivika]]s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=232}}<ref name=\"Beni2010\">{{cite book | author=Beni Madhab Barua | title=The Ajivikas | url=https://archive.org/details/ajivikas00barurich | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=5 May 2010 | publisher=General Books | isbn=978-1-152-74433-2 | pages=68\u201369}}</ref> Sometime later, another Nirgrantha follower in [[Pataliputra]] drew a similar picture. Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house.<ref name=\"Beni2010\"/> He also announced an award of one [[denarius|dinara]] (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic. According to ''Ashokavadana'', as a result of this order, his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd.{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=232}} Ashoka realised his mistake, and withdrew the order.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=28}}\n\nFor several reasons, scholars say, these stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda.<ref name=\"Beni2010\" /><ref name=\"Steven2010\">{{cite book | author=Steven L.

He ordered construction of 84,000 stupas throughout the earth, in towns that had a population of 100,000 or more. He told Elder Yashas, a monk at the Kukkutarama monastery, that he wanted these stupas to be completed on the same day.

His lavish patronage to the state patronage leads to many fake monks joining the sangha. The true Buddhist monks refuse to co-operate with these fake monks, and therefore, no [[uposatha]] ceremony is held for seven years. The king attempts to eradicate the fake monks, but during this attempt, an over-zealous minister ends up killing some real monks.

Similarly, in an inscription found at Sanchi, Sarnath, and Kosam, Ashoka mandates that the dissident members of the sangha should be expelled, and expresses his desire to the Sangha remain united and flourish.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=5}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=45}}\n\nThe 8th century Buddhist pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] records another story about Ashoka's involvement in the Buddhist sangha. According to this story, the earlier king [[Bimbisara]], who was a contemporary of the Gautama Buddha, once saw 18 fragments of a cloth and a stick in a dream. The Buddha interpreted the dream to mean that his philosophy would be divided into 18 schools after his death, and predicted that a king called Ashoka would unite these schools over a hundred years later.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=26}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "143"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "7"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "143"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "8"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "51"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "8"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "144"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "8"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "8\u20139"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gombrich"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "5"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Guruge, Unresolved"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "45"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Thapar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1961"}, {"name": "p", "value": "26"}]}], "id": 18}, {"title": " Buddhist missions ", "paragraphs": "\nIn the Sri Lankan tradition, [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] \u2013 who is patronised by Ashoka \u2013 sends out nine Buddhist missions to spread Buddhism in the \"border areas\" in c. 250 BCE.

Ashoka's [[Minor Pillar Edicts|Pillar Edicts]] suggest that during the next year, he made pilgrimage to Lumbini \u2013 the place of Buddha's birth, and to the stupa of the Buddha Kanakamuni.{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\nThe Rock Edict XIII states that Ashoka's won a \"dhamma victory\" by sending messengers to five kings and several other kingdoms. Whether these missions correspond to the Buddhist missions recorded in the Buddhist chronicles is debated.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=6}} Indologist [[Etienne Lamotte]] argues that the \"dhamma\" missionaries mentioned in Ashoka's inscriptions were probably not Buddhist monks, as this \"dhamma\" was not same as \"Buddhism\".{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=10\u201311}} Moreover, the lists of destinations of the missions and the dates of the missions mentioned in the inscriptions do not tally the ones mentioned in the Buddhist legends.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}}\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}} According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the ''Vinaya Nidana'' mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at [[Bhilsa]] (near [[Vidisha]]).

During these seven days, Tissa realised that the Buddhist monks gave up pleasure because they were aware of the eventual death. He then left the palace, and became an ''arhat''.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=27}}\n* The Theragatha commentary calls this brother Vitashoka.

He then retired to a monastery, and became an arhat.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=28}}\n* Faxian calls the younger brother Mahendra, and states that Ashoka shamed him for his immoral behaviour. The brother than retired to a dark cave, where he meditated, and became an arhat. Ashoka invited him to return to the family, but he preferred to live alone on a hill. So, Ashoka had a hill built for him within Pataliputra.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=28}}\n* The Ashoka-vadana states that Ashoka's brother was mistaken for a Nirgrantha, and killed during a massacre of the

One inscription records donations by his queen [[Karuvaki]], while the emperor is known to have donated the [[Barabar Caves]] to the [[Ajivika]]s.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=19}} There are some indirect references to his donations to Buddhists. For example, the Nigalisagar Pillar inscription records his enlargement of the Konakamana stupa.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|pp=20\u201321}} Similarly, the [[Lumbini#Pillar of Ashoka|Lumbini (Rumminidei) inscription]] states that he exempted the village of Buddha's birth from the land tax, and reduced the revenue tax to one-eighth.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=20}}\n\nAshoka appointed the ''dhamma-mahamatta'' officers, whose duties included the welfare of various religious sects, including the Buddhist sangha, Brahmins, Ajivikas, and Nirgranthas.

According to one interpretation, the term \"''amiss\u0101''\" derives from the word \"''am\u1e5b\u1e63a''\" (\"false\"), and thus, the phrase is a reference to Ashoak's belief in \"true\" and \"false\" gods. However, it is more likely that the term derives from the word \"''ami\u015bra''\" (\"not mingled\"), and the phrase refers to celestial beings who did not mingle with humans. The inscription claims that the righteousness generated by adoption of dhamma by the humans attracted even the celestial gods who did not mingle with humans.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n=== Dharma ===\n\n{{main|Ashoka's policy of Dhamma}}\n\nAshoka's various inscriptions suggest that he devoted himself to the propagation of \"Dharma\" (Pali: Dhamma), a term that refers to the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the Buddhist circles.{{sfn|Strong|1989|pp=3\u20134}} However, Ashoka's own inscriptions do not mention Buddhist doctrines such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] or [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]].{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=13}} The word \"Dharma\" has various connotations in the [[Indian religions]], and can be generally translated as \"law, duty, or righteousness\".{{sfn|Strong|1989|pp=3\u20134}} In the Kandahar inscriptions of Ashoka, the word \"Dharma\" has been translated as [[eusebeia]] (Greek) and qsyt (Aramaic), which further suggests that his \"Dharma\" meant something more generic than Buddhism.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=142}}\n\nThe inscriptions suggest that for Ashoka, Dharma meant \"a moral polity of active social concern, religious tolerance, ecological awareness, the observance of common ethical precepts, and the renunciation of war.\"{{sfn|Strong|1989|pp=3\u20134}} For example:\n\n* Abolition of the death penalty (Pillar Edict IV){{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=3}}\n* Plantation of banyan trees and mango groves, and construction of resthouses and wells, every half a mile along the roads. (Pillar Edict 7).{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=4}}\n* Restriction on killing of animals in the royal kitchen (Rock Edict 1); {{sfn|Strong|1989|p=4}} the number of animals killed was limited to two peacocks and a deer daily, and in future, even these animals were not to be killed.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=3}}\n* Provision of medical facilities for humans and animals (Rock Edict 2).{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=4}}\n* Encouragement of obedience to parents, \"generosity toward priests and ascetics, and frugality in spending\" (Rock Edict 3).{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=4}}\n* He \"commissions officers to work for the welfare and happiness of the poor and aged\" (Rock Edict 5){{sfn|Strong|1989|p=4}}\n* Promotion of \"the welfare of all beings so as to pay off his debt to living creatures and to work for their happiness in this world and the next.\" (Rock Edict 6){{sfn|Strong|1989|p=4}}\n\nModern scholars have variously understood this ''dhamma'' as a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a \"sort of universal religion\", or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an ''essentially political'' ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire.{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=131}}\n\nAshoka instituted a new category of officers called the ''dhamma-mahamattas'', who were tasked with the welfare of the aged, the infrm, the women and children, and various religious sects. They were also sent on diplomatic missions to the Hellenistic kingdoms of west Asia, in order to propagate the dhamma.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=31}}\n\nHistorically, the image of Ashoka in the global Buddhist circles was based on legends (such as those mentioned in the ''[[Ashokavadana]]'') rather than his rock edicts. This was because the Brahmi script in which these edicts were written was forgotten soon and remained undeciphered until its study by James Prinsep in the 19th century.{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=5}} The writings of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims such as Faxian and Xuanzang suggest that Ashoka's inscriptions mark the important sites associated with Gautama Buddha. These writers attribute Buddhism-related content to Ashoka's edicts, but this content does not match with the actual text of the inscriptions as determined by modern scholars after the decipherment of the Brahmi script. It is likely that the script was forgotten by the time of Faxian, who probably relied on local guides; these guides may have made up some Buddhism-related interpretations to gratify him, or may have themselves relied on faulty translations based on oral traditions. Xuanzang may have encountered a similar situation, or may have taken the supposed content of the inscriptions from Faxian's writings.{{sfn|Strong|1989|pp=6\u20139}} This theory is corroborated by the fact that some Brahmin scholars are known to have similarly come up with a fanciful interpretation of Ashoka pillar inscriptions, when requested to decipher them by the 14th century Muslim king [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]]. According to Shams-i Siraj's ''Tarikh-i Firoz Shahi'', after the king had these pillar transported from [[Topra Kalan|Topra]] and Mirat to Delhi as war trophies, these Brahmins told him that the inscriptions prophesized that nobody would be able to remove the pillars except a king named Firuz.

They were also sent on diplomatic missions to the Hellenistic kingdoms of west Asia, in order to propagate the dhamma.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=31}}\n\nHistorically, the image of Ashoka in the global Buddhist circles was based on legends (such as those mentioned in the ''[[Ashokavadana]]'') rather than his rock edicts. This was because the Brahmi script in which these edicts were written was forgotten soon and remained undeciphered until its study by James Prinsep in the 19th century.{{sfn|Strong|1989|p=5}} The writings of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims such as Faxian and Xuanzang suggest that Ashoka's inscriptions mark the important sites associated with Gautama Buddha. These writers attribute Buddhism-related content to Ashoka's edicts, but this content does not match with the actual text of the inscriptions as determined by modern scholars after the decipherment of the Brahmi script. It is likely that the script was forgotten by the time of Faxian, who probably relied on local guides; these guides may have made up some Buddhism-related interpretations to gratify him, or may have themselves relied on faulty translations based on oral traditions. Xuanzang may have encountered a similar situation, or may have taken the supposed content of the inscriptions from Faxian's writings.{{sfn|Strong|1989|pp=6\u20139}} This theory is corroborated by the fact that some Brahmin scholars are known to have similarly come up with a fanciful interpretation of Ashoka pillar inscriptions, when requested to decipher them by the 14th century Muslim king [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]]. According to Shams-i Siraj's ''Tarikh-i Firoz Shahi'', after the king had these pillar transported from [[Topra Kalan|Topra]] and Mirat to Delhi as war trophies, these Brahmins told him that the inscriptions prophesized that nobody would be able to remove the pillars except a king named Firuz. Moreover, by this time, there were local traditions that attributed the erection of these pillars to the legendary hero [[Bhima]].{{sfn|Strong|1989|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAccording to scholars such as Richard Gombrich, Ashoka's dharma shows Buddhist influence. For example, the Kalinga Separate Edict I seems to be inspired by Buddha's ''Advice to Sigala'' and his other sermons.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=3}}\n\n====Animal welfare====\n\nAshoka's rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good, and no animal should be sacrificed for slaughter.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2004|p=120}} However, he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Simoons |first=Frederick J. |date=1994 |title=Eat Not This Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwGZTQunH00C&pg=PA108 |edition=2nd |location=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=108 |isbn=978-0-299-14254-4}}</ref>\n\nHe imposed a ban on killing of \"all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible\", and of specific animal species including several birds, certain types of fish and bulls among others.

According to a ''Mahavamsa'' story, Ashoka, Nigrodha and Devnampiya Tissa were brothers in a previous life. In that life, a [[pratyekabuddha]] was looking for honey to cure another, sick pratyekabuddha. A woman directed him to a honey shop owned by the three brothers. Ashoka generously donated honey to the pratyekabuddha, and wished to become the sovereign ruler of Jambudvipa for this act of merit.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=146}} The woman wished to become his queen, and was reborn as Ashoka's wife Asandhamitta.{{sfn|Strong|1995|pp=146\u2013147}} Later Pali texts credit her with an additional act of merit: she gifted the pratyekabuddha a piece of cloth made by her. These texts include the ''Dasavatthuppakarana'', the so-called Cambodian or Extended ''Mahavamsa'' (possibly from 9th\u201310th centuries), and the ''Trai Bhumi Katha'' (15th century).{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=166}}\n\nAccording to an ''Ashokavadana'' story, Ashoka was born as Jaya in a prominent family of Rajagriha. When he was a little boy, he gave the Gautama Buddha dirt imagining it to be food. The Buddha approved of the donation, and Jaya declared that he would become a king by this act of merit. The text also state that Jaya's companion Vijaya was reborn as Ashoka's prime-minister Radhagupta.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=147}} In the later life, the Buddhist monk Upagupta tells Ashoka that his rough skin was caused by the impure gift of dirt in the previous life.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=149}} Some later texts repeat this story, without mentioning the negative implications of gifting dirt; these texts include Kumaralata's ''Kalpana-manditika'', Aryashura's ''Jataka-mala'', and the ''Maha-karma-vibhaga''. The Chinese writer Pao Ch'eng's ''Shih chia ju lai ying hua lu'' asserts that an insignificant act like gifting dirt could not have been meritorious enough to cause Ashoka's future greatness. Instead, the text claims that in another past life, Ashoka commissioned a large number of Buddha statues as a king, and this act of merit caused him to become a great emperor in the next life.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=163}}\n\nThe 14th century Pali-language fairy tale ''Dasavatthuppakarana'' (possibly from c. 14th century) combines the stories about the merchant's gift of honey, and the boy's gift of dirt. It narrates a slightly different version of the ''Mahavamsa'' story, stating that it took place before the birth of the Gautama Buddha. It then states that the merchant was reborn as the boy who gifted dirt to the Buddha; however, in this case, the Buddha his attendant to [[\u0100nanda]] to create [[plaster]] from the dirt, which is used repair cracks in the monastery walls.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=163-165}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "146"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "146\u2013147"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "166"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "147"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "149"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "163"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Strong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "163-165"}]}], "id": 37}, {"title": " Legacy ", "paragraphs": "\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBesides the various stupas attributed to Ashoka, the [[pillars of Ashoka|pillars erected by him]] survive at various places in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAshoka is often credited with the beginning of stone architecture in India, possibly following the introduction of stone-building techniques by the [[Greco-Bactrian|Greeks after Alexander the Great]].<ref name=\"Stone\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpfTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT21 Introduction to Indian Architecture Bindia Thapar, Tuttle Publishing, 2012, p.21] \"Ashoka used the knowledge of stone craft to begin the tradition of stone architecture in India, dedicated to Buddhism.\"</ref> Before Ashoka's time, buildings were probably built in non-permanent material, such as wood, [[bamboo]] or [[thatch]].<ref name=\"Stone\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TlVeuxIgjwQC&pg=PA14 Gardner's Art through the Ages: Non-Western Perspectives, Fred S.

[[Mortimer Wheeler]], a British archaeologist, also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the [[Taxila]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Perceptions and historiography===\n\nThe use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that \"We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics.\"<ref name=\"Ashoka - A Retrospective\">{{cite journal|last1=Thappar|first1=Romila|title=Ashoka \u2013 A Retrospective|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=7\u201313 November 2009|volume=44|issue=45|pages=31\u201337}}</ref> The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, \"The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Universal Truths and the Westernizing Illusion|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Summer 1998|volume=20|issue=3|pages=40\u201343}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the edicts alone strongly ''indicate'' that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an \"[[upasaka]]\", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|\"dhamma\"]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word.

Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that \"We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics.\"<ref name=\"Ashoka - A Retrospective\">{{cite journal|last1=Thappar|first1=Romila|title=Ashoka \u2013 A Retrospective|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=7\u201313 November 2009|volume=44|issue=45|pages=31\u201337}}</ref> The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, \"The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Universal Truths and the Westernizing Illusion|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Summer 1998|volume=20|issue=3|pages=40\u201343}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the edicts alone strongly ''indicate'' that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an \"[[upasaka]]\", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|\"dhamma\"]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. However, he used the word more in the spirit than as a strict code of conduct. Romila Thappar writes, \"His dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration, even if its observance promised heaven. It was more in keeping with the ethic conditioned by the logic of given situations. His logic of Dhamma was intended to influence the conduct of categories of people, in relation to each other.
