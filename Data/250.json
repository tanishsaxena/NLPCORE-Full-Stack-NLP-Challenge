There he met [[Ascanio Sobrero]], who had invented [[nitroglycerin]] three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin, as it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive, as it had much more power than [[gunpowder]]. At age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=8143|title=Alfred B Nobel - Svenskt Biografiskt Lexikon|website=sok.riksarkivet.se}}</ref> working for a short period under Swedish-American inventor [[John Ericsson]], who designed the [[American Civil War]] ironclad ''[[USS Monitor]]''.

Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel invented a [[detonator]] in 1863, and in 1865 designed the [[blasting cap]].{{r|Brit1}}\n\nOn 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in [[Heleneborg]], Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]].<ref name=\"Gale\"/> Dogged and unfazed by more minor accidents, Nobel went on to build further factories, focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing.<ref name=\"Gale\"/> Nobel invented [[dynamite]] in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable [[nitroglycerin]]. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally.{{r|Brit1}} In 1875 Nobel invented [[gelignite]], more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887 patented [[ballistite]], a predecessor of [[cordite]].{{r|Brit1}}\n\nNobel was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, the same institution that would later select [[laureates]] for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1893.\n\n[[File:Nobel's death mask.jpg|thumb|Alfred Nobel's [[death mask]], at Bjorkborn, Nobel's residence in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden]]\nNobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert exploited [[oilfields]] along the [[Caspian Sea]] and became hugely rich in their own right.

One French newspaper published an obituary titled \"Le marchand de la mort est mort\" ''(\"The merchant of death is dead\")''.

'[[Gelignite]]', or blasting gelatine, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\"/> Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the ''Age of Engineering'' bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health.

For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted \"ideal\" as \"idealistic\" (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.{{Citation needed|date = November 2016}}\n\nThere was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}\n\nSweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1968 by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a sixth prize in the field of economics in honour of Alfred Nobel.  In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given \"in Alfred Nobel's memory\" from the five other awards.
