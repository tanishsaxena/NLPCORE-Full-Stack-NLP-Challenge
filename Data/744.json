When Aristobulus I, Hyrcanus' son by his first wife, became king, he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half-brother. Aristobulus died after a reign of one year. Upon his death, his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]] had Alexander and his brothers released from prison. One of these brothers is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne.\n\nAlexander, as the oldest living brother, had the right not only to the throne, but also to Salome, [[Yibbum|the widow of his deceased brother, who had died childless]]; and, although she was thirteen years older than him, he married her in accordance with Jewish law. By her he had two sons: the eldest, [[Hyrcanus II]], became high-priest in 62 BCE; and [[Aristobulus II]], who was high-priest from 66 - 62&nbsp;BCE and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]]. Like his brother, he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the [[Sadducees]]. His wife Salome on the other hand, came from a [[pharisaic]] family (her brother was [[Simeon ben Shetach]], a famous [[Pharisee]] leader) and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign. Like his father, Alexander also served as the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]. This raised the ire of the religious authorities who insisted that these two offices should not be combined. According to the [[Talmud]], Yannai was a questionable desecrated priest (rumour had it that his mother was captured in [[Modiin]] and violated) and, in the opinion of the Pharisees, was not allowed to serve in the [[Second Temple|temple]]. This infuriated the king and he sided with the Sadducees who defended him. This incident led the king to turn against the Pharisees and he persecute them until his death.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2019"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": " War with Ptolemy Lathyrus ", "paragraphs": "Alexander's first expedition was against the city of [[Acre, Israel|Ptolemais]]. While Alexander went ahead to besiege the city, Zoilus of [[Dor, Israel|Dora]] took the opportunity to see if he could relieve Ptolemais in hopes of establishing his rule over coastal territories. Alexander's Hasmonean army quickly defeated Zoilus's forces. Ptolemais then requested aid from [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], who had been banished by his mother [[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]]; Ptolemy founded a kingdom in [[History of Cyprus|Cyprus]] after being cast out by his mother. The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt by sea. However, an individual named Demaenetus convinced the inhabitants of their imprudence in requesting Ptolemy's assistance. They realised that by allying themselves with Ptolemy, they had unintentionally declared war on Cleopatra. When Ptolemy arrived at the city, the inhabitants denied him access.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=130 & 131}}\n\nAlexander too didn't want to be involved in a war between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, so he abandoned his campaign against Ptolemais and returned to [[Jerusalem]]. After offering Ptolemy four hundred [[Talent (weight)|talents]] and a peace treaty in return for Zoilus's death, Alexander met him with treachery by negotiating an alliance with Cleopatra. Once he had formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Alexader continued his conquests by capturing the coastal cities of Dora and [[Caesarea Maritima|Straton's Tower]]. As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexander's scheme, he was determined to kill him. Ptolemy put Ptolemais under siege, but left his generals to attack the city, while he continued to pursue Alexander. Ptolemy's pursuit caused much destruction in the [[Galilee|Galilee region]]. Here he captured [[Shikhin|Asochis]] on the [[Sabbath]], taking ten thousand people as prisoners. Ptolemy also initiated an unsuccessful attack on [[Sepphoris]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=131 & 132}}\n\n=== Battle of Asophon ===\nPtolemy and Alexander engaged in battle at Asophon near the [[Jordan River]]. Estimated to have fifty to eighty thousand soldiers, Alexander's army consisted of both [[Jews]] and [[Paganism|pagans]]. At the head of his armed forces were his elite pagan mercenaries; they were specialised in [[Ancient Greek warfare|Greek-style]] [[phalanx]]. One of Ptolemy's commanders, Philostephanus, commenced the first attack by crossing the river that divided both forces. The Hasmoneans had the advantage, however, Philostephanus held back a certain amount of his forces whom he sent to recover lost ground. Perceiving them as vast reinforcements, Alexander's army fled. Some of his retreating forces tried to push back, but quickly dispersed as Ptolemy's forces pursued Alexander's fleeing army; thirty to fifty thousand Hasmonean soldiers died.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|pp=132 & 133}}\n\nPtolemy's forces at Ptolemais also succeeded in capturing the city. He then continued to conquer much of the Hasmonean kingdom, occupying the entirety of northern Judea, the coast, and territories east of the Jordan River. While doing so, he pillaged villages and ordered his soldiers to cannibalise women and children to create psychological fear towards his enemies.

She too also went with a fleet towards Judea. When Cleopatra arrived at Ptolemais, the people refused her entry, so she besieged the city. Ptolemy, believing Syria was defenseless, withdrew to Cyprus after his miscalculation. While in pursuit of Ptolemy, Chelkias died in [[Coele-Syria]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=134}}\n\nThe war abruptly came to an end with Ptolemy fleeing to Cyprus. Alexander then approached Cleopatra.

There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon positions but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at [[Shechem]], and all of Alexander's mercenaries were killed in battle. This defeat forced Alexander to take refuge in the mountains. In sympathy towards Jannaeus, six thousand Judean rebels ultimately returned to him. In fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. Nevertheless, war between Jannaeus and the rebels who returned to him continued. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of Bethoma until they were defeated (Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 13.372-83).{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=118 & 119}}\n\nJannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he had eight hundred Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their deaths, Alexander had the rebels' wives and children executed before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines. Alexander later returned the land he had seized in [[Moab]] and [[Gilead#Places|Galaaditis]] from the Nabataeans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish rebels. The remaining rebels who numbered eight thousand, fled by night in fear of Alexander. Afterward, all rebel hostility ceased and Alexander's reign continued undisturbed.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=119}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Eshel"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "118 & 119"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Eshel"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "p", "value": "119"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": " Final campaigns and death ", "paragraphs": "During his last years, Alexander continued campaigning in the east.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} The Nabataean king [[Aretas III]] managed to defeat Alexander in battle, however, Alexander continued expanding the Hasmonean kingdom into [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} In [[Gaulanitis]], he captured the cities of Gaulana, [[Seleucia Samulias|Seleucia]], [[Gamla|Gamala]]{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} and [[Hippos]];{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Obbink|Holland|2004|p=362}} in [[Gilead#Places|Galaaditis]], the cities of [[Pella]], [[Dium (Coele-Syria)|Dium]], and [[Jerash|Gerasa]].{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|p=75}} Alexander had Pella destroyed for refusing to [[Judaization|Judaize]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2016|p=132}} Alexander captured all these cities in a period of three years (83-80 BCE).
