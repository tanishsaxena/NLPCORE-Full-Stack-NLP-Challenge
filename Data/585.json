Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah \"straw\" plus rubay \"attract, snatch\", referring to its electrical properties), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba (which later became the Arabic word for [[electricity]], \u0643\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0621 ''kahrab\u0101<nowiki>'</nowiki>''), it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation\u2014easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry.\nMuch of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as \"bony amber\".<ref>\"Amber\". (1999). In G. W. Bowersock, Peter Brown, Oleg Grabar (eds.)
