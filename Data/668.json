Albert was the first European ruler to establish Lutheranism, and thus [[Protestantism]], as the official [[state religion]] of his lands. He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage, ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades (1510\u20131568).\n\nA member of the [[Principality of Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]] branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], Albert became Grand Master, where his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the Teutonic Order. But Albert, who was sympathetic to the demands of [[Martin Luther]], rebelled against the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by converting the Teutonic state into a Protestant and hereditary realm, the Duchy of Prussia, for which he paid homage to his uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I, King of Poland]]. That arrangement was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Krak\u00f3w]] in 1525. Albert pledged a personal oath to the King and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs.\n\nAlbert's rule in Prussia was fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the Catholic Church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established [[Prussian court]]. He was active in imperial politics, joining the [[League of Torgau]] in 1526, and acted in unison with the Protestants in plotting to overthrow Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] after the issue of the [[Augsburg Interim]] in May 1548. Albert established schools in every town and founded [[K\u00f6nigsberg University]] in 1544.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Albert (grand master)|display=Albert|volume=1|page=497}}</ref> He promoted culture and arts, patronising the works of [[Erasmus Reinhold]] and [[Caspar Hennenberger]]. During the final years of his rule, Albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now-depleted church lands, causing peasant rebellion. The intrigues of the court favourites [[Johann Funck]] and [[Paul Skali\u0107]] also led to various religious and political disputes. Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at [[Tapiau]] on 20 March 1568. His son, [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]], succeeded him as Duke of Prussia.\n\nAlbert's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia, paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Albert of Prussia"}, {"name": "2", "value": "other people"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Albert of Hohenzollern (disambiguation){{!}}Albert of Hohenzollern"}]}, {"name": "More footnotes", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "March 2016"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox royalty\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Albert"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights<br />Duke of Prussia"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Bildnis des Markgrafen Albrecht von Brandenburg-Ansbach (Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum).jpg"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Albert of Prussia, painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], dated 1528"}, {"name": "succession", "value": "[[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights]]"}, {"name": "reign", "value": "1510{{snd}}1525"}, {"name": "predecessor", "value": "[[Duke Frederick of Saxony]]"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "[[Walter von Cronberg]]"}, {"name": "succession1", "value": "[[Duke of Prussia]]"}, {"name": "reign1", "value": "10 April 1525{{snd}}20 March 1568"}, {"name": "successor1", "value": "[[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick of Prussia]]"}, {"name": "house", "value": "[[House of Hohenzollern]]"}, {"name": "father", "value": "[[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Frederick I of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]"}, {"name": "mother", "value": "[[Sophia of Poland]]"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "[[Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia|Dorothea of Denmark]] <br/> [[Anna Marie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "[[Anna Sophia of Prussia|Anna Sophia]]<br/>[[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]]"}, {"name": "issue-link", "value": "#Spouse and issue"}, {"name": "issue-pipe", "value": "among others..."}, {"name": "religion", "value": "[[Catholicism]] ''(until 1525)''<br/>[[Lutheranism]] ''(from 1525)''"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "17 May 1490<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12674/Albert Albert (duke of Prussia)].

His mother was [[Sophia of Poland|Sophia]], daughter of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]], and his wife [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]]. He was raised for a career in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and spent some time at the court of [[Hermann IV of Hesse]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]], who appointed him canon of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\nNot only was he quite religious; he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the Church in favour of scientific theories. His career was forwarded by the Church, however, and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advancement.\n\nTurning to a more active life, Albert accompanied Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to [[Italy]] in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Grand Master", "paragraphs": "[[File:Albrecht von Hohenzollern.jpg|thumb|upright|left|As Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, painting from 1522]]\n[[Duke Frederick of Saxony]], Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]], died in December 1510. Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old]], Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], which had been held by the order under Polish [[suzerainty]] since the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland. As war over the order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with Emperor Maximilian I. The ill-feeling, influenced by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland, culminated in [[Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1519\u20131521)|a war]] which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia. Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe dispute was referred to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and other princes, but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war. For this purpose he visited the [[Diet of Nuremberg]] in 1522, where he made the acquaintance of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]] [[Andreas Osiander]], by whose influence Albert was won over to [[Protestantism]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe Grand Master then journeyed to [[Wittenberg]], where he was advised by [[Martin Luther]] to abandon the rules of his order, to marry, and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself. This proposal, which was understandably appealing to Albert, had already been discussed by some of his relatives; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously, and he assured [[Pope Adrian VI]] that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] doctrines. Luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion, but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians, while Albert's brother, Margrave [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], laid the scheme before their uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "Duke in Prussia", "paragraphs": "[[File:Prussian Homage.jpg|350px|thumb|''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Homage]]'': Albert and his brothers receive the [[Duchy of Prussia]] as a [[fief]] from  Polish King [[Sigismund I the Old]], 1525. [[History painting|Painting]] by [[Jan Matejko|Matejko]], 1882.]]\nAfter some delay Sigismund assented to the offer, with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a [[Treaty of Krak\u00f3w|treaty concluded at Krak\u00f3w]], Albert pledged a [[Prussian Homage|personal oath]] to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] of the land then met at [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke, who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther. This transition did not, however, take place without protest. Summoned before the imperial court of justice, Albert refused to appear and was proscribed, while the order elected a new Grand Master, [[Walter von Cronberg]], who received Prussia as a fief at the imperial [[Diet of Augsburg]]. As the German princes were experiencing the tumult of the Reformation, the [[German Peasants' War]], and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars against the Ottoman Turks]], they did not enforce the ban on the duke, and agitation against him soon died away.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn imperial politics Albert was fairly active. Joining the [[League of Torgau]] in 1526, he acted in unison with the Protestants, and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the [[Augsburg Interim]] in May 1548. For various reasons, however, poverty and personal inclination among others, he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n[[File:Albrecht von Brandenburg-Preu\u00dfen Groschen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|One [[Groschen]] coin, 1534, ''[[Epistle to the Galatians|Iustus ex fide vivit]] \u2014 The Just lives on Faith'']]\n\nThe early years of Albert's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court. He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life. In 1544, in spite of some opposition, he founded [[K\u00f6nigsberg University]], where he appointed his friend Andreas Osiander to a professorship in 1549.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical \"[[Prutenic Tables]]\" compiled by [[Erasmus Reinhold]] and the first maps of Prussia by [[Caspar Hennenberger]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.obspm.fr/index.php/index.php?showAll=1&formSearchTextfield=Prutenic+Tables|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Astronomy and Astrophysics - 1|website=dictionary.obspm.fr|access-date=1 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOsiander's appointment was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert's reign. Osiander's divergence from Luther's doctrine of [[justification by faith]] involved him in a violent quarrel with [[Philip Melanchthon]], who had adherents in K\u00f6nigsberg, and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town. The duke strenuously supported Osiander, and the area of the quarrel soon broadened. There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles, the burden of taxation was heavy, and Albert's rule became unpopular.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAfter Osiander's death in 1552, Albert favoured a preacher named [[Johann Funck]], who, with an adventurer named [[Paul Skali\u0107]], exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense. The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of Albert's early death and the need, should that happen, to appoint a [[regent]], as his only son, [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] was still a mere youth. The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander, and the climax came in 1566 when the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] appealed to King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of Poland, Albert's cousin, who sent a commission to K\u00f6nigsberg. Skali\u0107 saved his life by flight, but Funck was executed. The question of the regency was settled, and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n[[File:Paulus Scalichius (Scaligius, c.1534-1575).png|thumb|170px|Portrait of [[Pavao Skali\u0107]], an [[encyclopedist]], [[Renaissance humanist]] and adventurer from [[Croatia]], who strongly influenced the Duke in the closing years of his reign]]\n\nVirtually deprived of power, the duke lived for two more years, and died at [[Gvardeysk|Tapiau]] on 20 March 1568<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> of the plague, along with his wife.
