He was the youngest of three children, who included [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] and [[Satyrus of Milan|Satyrus]] (who is the subject of Ambrose's ''De excessu fratris Satyri''), also venerated as saints.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90298 | title = Santi Beati | place = Italy | language = Italian}}</ref> There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of [[bee]]s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of honey. His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive]]s often appear in the [[saint symbolism|saint's symbology]].\n\nAfter the early death of his father, Ambrose went to Rome where he studied [[literature]], [[law]], and [[rhetoric]]. He then followed in his father's footsteps and entered public service. [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him governor of Liguria and Emilia, with headquarters at Milan.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} In 286 Diocletian had moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum (Milan).\n\nAmbrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374, when he became the Bishop of Milan. He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of [[Valentinian I]].\n\n=== Bishop of Milan ===\nIn the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the [[diocese of Milan]] between the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Church]] and [[Arianism|Arians]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Wilken | title = The Spirit of Early Christian Thought | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2003 | page = 218}}</ref>{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}} In 374 [[Auxentius of Milan|the bishop of Milan, Auxentius]], an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the [[Apostolic succession|succession]]. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call, \"Ambrose, bishop!\", which was taken up by the whole assembly.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}}\n\nAmbrose was known to be Nicene Christian in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]].{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]].\n\nAs bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] (who had become a nun). This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor. Upon the unexpected appointment of Ambrose to the episcopate, his brother Satyrus resigned a prefecture in order to move to Milan, where he took over managing the family's affairs.<ref name = \"CE\" />\n\n=== Arianism ===\n[[File:Museo del Duomo - Milan - St Ambrose of Milan - Unknown Lombard author (early 17 century).jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Ambrose with a scourge in Museo del Duomo, Milan. Unknown Lombard author, early 17 century.]]\n\nAmbrose studied theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} Using to his advantage his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxcviii.html | title = Letter of Basil to Ambrose | publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal library | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}</ref> He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed [[Augustine of Hippo]], who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.\n\nIn the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the [[Nicene creed]] and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy. The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor [[Gratian]] supported orthodoxy, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} especially among the higher clergy.\n\nIn this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria]] and Secundianus of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken and Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}}\n\nNevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the [[Basilica]] of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), be allocated to the Arians.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine service]] in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons{{sfn|Butler|1991|p=408}} to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]].{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nIn spite of Imperial opposition, Ambrose declared, \"If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it.\"{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nIn 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop [[Auxentius of Durostorum|Auxentius the younger]], and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Cambridge Ancient History | page = 106}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial relations ===\n[[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral]]'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. [[National Gallery, London]].]]\nThe imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor. When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nA second later embassy was unsuccessful. The enemy entered [[Italy]] and [[Milan]] was taken. Justina and her son fled but Ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\n[[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was [[Excommunication#Roman Catholic Church|excommunicated]] by Ambrose for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]] of 7,000 people at [[Thessalonika|Thessalonica]] in 390,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} and he readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance. This shows the strong position of a bishop in the western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor. The controversy of [[John Chrysostom]] with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.\n\nIn 392, after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the fall of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\n[[File:AmbroseGiuLungara.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of St. Ambrose|Saint Ambrose with [[scourge]] and book, a painting in the church of San Giuseppe alla Lungara, Rome]]\n\n=== Attitude towards Jews ===\nIn his treatise on [[Abraham]], Ambrose warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics.<ref>[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0339-0397,_Ambrosius,_De_Abraham_Libri_Duo,_LT.pdf ''De Abraham'', ix. 84, xiv. 451]</ref> In 388, Emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the [[synagogue]] at Callinicum on the [[Euphrates]].

This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381.

(The later pope [[Gregory I the Great]] is not known to have composed any [[Gregorian chant]], the [[plainsong]] or \"[[Romish chant]]\".) However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing [[hymnody]] from the Eastern Church into the West.\n\nCatching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several original [[hymn]]s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies. Each of these hymns has eight, four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic tetrameter (that is 4 x 2 syllables, each iamb being two syllables). Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n* ''Deus Creator Omnium''\n* ''Aeterne rerum conditor''\n* ''Jam surgit hora tertia''\n* ''Jam Christus astra ascenderat''\n* ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'' (a [[Christmas]] hymn){{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}}\n\nIn his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of [[psalms]], in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''.\n\nSaint Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn \"[[Te Deum]]\", which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], his celebrated convert.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "circa", "values": [{"name": "lk", "value": "no"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1500"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ambrosian Hymnography"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Grieve"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "799"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Grieve"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "799"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": " Augustine ", "paragraphs": "Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''.
