Every [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is composed of neutral or [[ionized]] atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100&nbsp;[[picometer]]s ({{val|1e-10|u=m}}, a ten-millionth of a millimeter, or 1/254,000,000 of an inch). They are [[microscopic scale|so small]] that accurately predicting their behavior using [[classical physics]]&nbsp;\u2013 as if they were [[billiard ball]]s, for example&nbsp;\u2013 is not possible. This is due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]]. Current atomic models now use [[#Further developments in quantum physics|quantum principles]] to better explain and predict this behavior.\n\nEvery atom is composed of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more [[electron]]s bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more [[proton]]s and a number of [[neutron]]s. Only the most common variety of [[hydrogen]] has no neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called [[nucleon]]s. More than 99.94% of an atom's [[mass]] is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive [[electric charge]] whereas the electrons have a negative electric charge. The neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively. These atoms are called [[ion|ions]].\n\nThe electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the [[nuclear force]]. This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus shatters and [[nuclear transmutation|leaves behind different elements]]. This is a kind of [[nuclear decay]]. All electrons, nucleons, and nuclei alike are [[subatomic particle]]s. The behavior of electrons in atoms is [[wave\u2013particle duality|closer to a wave than a particle]].\n\nThe number of protons in the nucleus, called the ''[[atomic number]]'', defines to which chemical element the atom belongs. For example, each [[copper]] atom contains 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the [[isotope]] of the element. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by [[chemical bond]]s to form [[chemical compound]]s such as [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. [[Chemistry]] is the discipline that studies these changes.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "smallest unit of a chemical element"}]}, {"name": "pp-semi-indef", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2013"}]}, {"name": "val", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1e-10"}, {"name": "u", "value": "m"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "History of atomic theory", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Atomic theory}}\n\n===Atoms in philosophy===\n{{Main|Atomism}}\nThe idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India.

For instance, there are two types of [[tin oxide (disambiguation)|tin oxide]]: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen ([[tin(II) oxide]] and [[tin dioxide]] respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in multiples of discrete units \u2014 in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\">{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen |year=1952 |title=From Atomos to Atom |isbn= 978-0-486-49584-2 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, NY}}</ref>\n\nDalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] far better than it absorbs [[nitrogen]].<ref name = \"Dalton_1803_paper\">Dalton, John. \"[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/dalton52.html On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611205519/http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/dalton52.html |date=11 June 2011 }}\", in ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester''. 1803. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.</ref> Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO<sub>2</sub>) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>).\n\n===Brownian motion===\nIn 1827, [[Botany|botanist]] [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as \"[[Brownian motion]]\". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first [[statistical physics]] analysis of [[Brownian motion]].<ref name=adp322_8_549/><ref>{{cite book\n|last=Mazo|first=Robert M.|year=2002\n|title=Brownian Motion: Fluctuations, Dynamics, and Applications\n|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851567-8\n|oclc=48753074|pages=1\u20137}}\n</ref><ref name=lee_hoon1995/> French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying [[Dalton's atomic theory]].<ref name=e31_2_50/>\n\n===Discovery of the electron===\n[[File:Geiger-Marsden experiment expectation and result.svg|thumb|right|The '''[[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment]]'''<br /> ''Left:'' Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection.<br /> ''Right:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus.]]\nThe physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] measured the mass of [[cathode ray]]s, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, [[hydrogen]]. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first ''[[subatomic particle|subatomic]]'' particle to be discovered, which he originally called \"''[[wikt:corpuscle|corpuscle]]''\" but was later named ''electron'', after particles postulated by [[George Johnstone Stoney]] in 1874. He also showed they were identical to particles given off by [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and radioactive materials.<ref name=\"Thomson\">{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=J.J.|title=On bodies smaller than atoms|journal=The Popular Science Monthly|volume=|issue= |pages=323\u2013335|date=August 1901|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3CMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA323|doi= |id= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry [[electric current]]s in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge within atoms. Thomson was given the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.<ref name=nobel1096/> Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the [[plum pudding model]].\n\n===Discovery of the nucleus===\n{{main|Geiger-Marsden experiment}}\nIn 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], under the direction of [[Ernest Rutherford]], bombarded a metal foil with [[alpha particle]]s to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90\u00b0, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.<ref name=pm21_669/>\n\n===Discovery of isotopes===\nWhile experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the [[periodic table]].<ref name=npc1921/> The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for [[isotope separation]] through his work on [[ionized gas]]es, which subsequently led to the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s.<ref name=prsA_89_1_1913/>\n\n===Bohr model===\n[[File:Bohr atom animation 2.gif|right|thumb|The Bohr model of the atom, with an electron making instantaneous \"quantum leaps\" from one orbit to another. This model is obsolete.]]\n{{main|Bohr model}}\n\nIn 1913 the physicist [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.<ref name=stern20050516/> This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see ''[[synchrotron radiation]]'') and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.<ref name=bohr19221211/>\n\nLater in the same year [[Henry Moseley]] provided additional experimental evidence in favor of [[Bohr model|Niels Bohr's theory]]. These results refined [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s and [[Antonius Van den Broek]]'s model, which proposed that the atom contains in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] a number of positive [[nuclear charge]]s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, [[atomic number]] was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.<ref name=\"Pais\">{{Cite book|last=Pais|first=Abraham|year=1986|location=New York|title=Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851971-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/inwardboundofmat00pais_0/page/228 228\u2013230]|url=https://archive.org/details/inwardboundofmat00pais_0/page/228}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical bonding explained===\n[[Chemical bond]]s between atoms were now explained, by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.<ref name=jacs38_4_762/> As the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the [[periodic law]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Scerri|first=Eric R.|title=The periodic table: its story and its significance|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-530573-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/periodictableits0000scer/page/205 205\u2013226]|url=https://archive.org/details/periodictableits0000scer/page/205}}</ref> in 1919 the American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of [[electron shell]]s about the nucleus.<ref name=jacs41_6_868/>\n\n===Further developments in quantum physics===\nThe [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]] of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or [[spin (physics)|spin]]. As this spin direction is initially random, the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction. Instead, the beam was split into two directional components, corresponding to the atomic [[spin (physics)|spin]] being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field.<ref name=fop17_6_575/>\n\nIn 1925 [[Werner Heisenberg]] published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ([[Matrix Mechanics]]).<ref name=\"Pais\"/> One year earlier, in 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] had proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves and, in 1926, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom (Wave Mechanics) that described the electrons as three-dimensional [[waveform]]s rather than point particles.\n\nA consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the [[Point (geometry)|position]] and [[momentum]] of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the [[uncertainty principle]], formulated by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1927.<ref name=\"Pais\"/> In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chad Orzel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKELOE9eY4|title=What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?|website=TED-Ed|date=16 September 2014|via=YouTube|access-date=26 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913185956/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKELOE9eY4|archive-date=13 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThis model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and [[Spectral line|spectral]] patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [[atomic orbital]] zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.<ref name=brown2007/><ref name=harrison2000/>\n\n===Discovery of the neutron===\nThe development of the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist [[Francis William Aston]] used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The [[atomic mass]] of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the [[whole number rule]].<ref name=pm39_6_449/> The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the [[neutron]], an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the [[proton]], by the physicist [[James Chadwick]] in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.<ref name=chadwick1935/>\n\n===Fission, high-energy physics and condensed matter===\nIn 1938, the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get [[transuranium element]]s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed [[barium]] as a product.<ref name=Bowden/><ref name=CHF/> A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''.<ref name=nature143_3615_239/><ref name=schroeder/> In 1944, Hahn received the [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.<ref name=pt50_9_26/>\n\nIn the 1950s, the development of improved [[particle accelerator]]s and [[particle detector]]s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.<ref name=kullander2001/> Neutrons and protons were found to be [[hadron]]s, or composites of smaller particles called [[quark]]s. The [[standard model of particle physics]] was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.<ref name=npp1990/>\n\n===Video of atoms bonding===\nIn January 2020, for the first time, scientists reported a video of atoms bonding and separating.<ref name=\"SA-20200117\">{{cite journal |author=Cao, Kecheng |display-authors=et al. |title=Imaging an unsupported metal\u2013metal bond in dirhenium molecules at the atomic scale |url=https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/3/eaay5849 |date=17 January 2020 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume=6 |number=3 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aay5849 |accessdate=23 January 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"YN-20200122\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Scientists Capture First-Ever Video of Atoms Bonding and Separating |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-capture-first-ever-video-104058305.html |date=22 January 2020 |work=[[Yahoo News]] |accessdate=23 January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Atomic theory"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Atomism"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Pullman"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Bernard"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Atom in the History of Human Thought"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford University Press"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Oxford, England"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-19-515040-7"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "31\u201333"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=IQs5hur-BpgC&pg=PA56&dq=Leucippus+Democritus+atom#v=onepage&q=Leucippus%20Democritus%20atom&f=false"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "harv"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Kenny"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Anthony"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Anthony Kenny"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ancient Philosophy"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=cpYUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anthony+Kenny+Ancient+Philosophy#v=onepage&q=Democritus&f=false"}, {"name": "series", "value": "A New History of Western Philosophy"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Oxford, England"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford University Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-19-875273-8"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "26\u201328"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "harv"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Pyle"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Andrew"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Andrew Pyle (philosopher)"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Atoms and Atomism"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Classical Tradition"}, {"name": "chapter-url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&q=Epicurus#v=snippet&q=Atoms&f=false"}, {"name": "editor1-last", "value": "Grafton"}, {"name": "editor1-first", "value": "Anthony"}, {"name": "editor1-link", "value": "Anthony Grafton"}, {"name": "editor2-last", "value": "Most"}, {"name": "editor2-first", "value": "Glenn W."}, {"name": "editor2-link", "value": "Glenn W.

However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of [[elementary particle]]s called [[quark]]s. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with charge +{{sfrac|2|3}}) and one [[down quark]] (with a charge of \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.<ref name=pdg2002/><ref name=schombert2006/>\n\nThe quarks are held together by the [[strong interaction]] (or strong force), which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the [[nuclear force]], which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of [[gauge boson]]s, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.<ref name=pdg2002/><ref name=schombert2006/>\n\n===Nucleus===\n{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|The [[binding energy]] needed for a nucleon to escape the nucleus, for various isotopes]]<!-- A brief explanation is provided here because 'binding energy' is not explained until the end of the section. -->\n\nAll the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny [[atomic nucleus]], and are collectively called [[nucleon]]s.

Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the [[nuclide]]. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing [[radioactive decay]].<ref name=wenner2007/>\n\nThe proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as [[fermion]]s. Fermions obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] which prohibits ''[[identical particles|identical]]'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.<ref name=\"raymond\"/>\n\nA nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons.<ref name=\"raymond\"/>\n\n[[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons. A [[positron]] (e<sup>+</sup>)\u2014an [[antimatter]] electron\u2014is emitted along with an electron [[neutrino]].]]\n\nThe number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. [[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3\u201310 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion\u2014the [[coulomb barrier]]\u2014and fuse together into a single nucleus.<ref name=mihos2002/> [[Nuclear fission]] is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei\u2014usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.<ref name=lbnl20070330/><ref name=makhijani_saleska2001/>\n\nIf the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [[gamma ray]], or the kinetic energy of a [[beta particle]]), as described by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] formula, <math>E=mc^2</math>, where <math>m</math> is the mass loss and <math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]]. This deficit is part of the [[binding energy]] of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shultis|first1=J.

For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per [[nucleon]] in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and [[atomic mass]]es higher than about 60, is an [[endothermic reaction|endothermic process]]. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of a star.<ref name=\"raymond\"/>\n\n===Electron cloud===\n{{Main|Atomic orbital|Electron configuration}}\n\n[[File:Potential energy well.svg|right|thumb|A potential well, showing, according to [[classical mechanics]], the minimum energy ''V''(''x'') needed to reach each position ''x''. Classically, a particle with energy ''E'' is constrained to a range of positions between ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>.]]\nThe electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.\n\nElectrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave\u2013particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]\u2014a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [[atomic orbital]], a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.<ref name=science157_3784_13/> Only a discrete (or [[wikt:quantize|quantized]]) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.<ref name=Brucat2008/> Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.<ref name=manthey2001/>\n\n[[File:Oganesson Subshells and Orbitals.tif|right|thumb| [[Oganesson]].

The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [[atomic spectral line]]s.<ref name=Brucat2008/>\n\nThe amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron\u2014the [[electron binding energy]]\u2014is far less than the [[binding energy|binding energy of nucleons]]. For example, it requires only 13.6&nbsp;eV to strip a [[Stationary state|ground-state]] electron from a hydrogen atom,<ref name=herter_8/> compared to 2.23&nbsp;''million'' eV for splitting a [[deuterium]] nucleus.<ref name=pr79_2_282/> Atoms are [[electric charge|electrically]] neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ion]]s. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms.

However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of [[elementary particle]]s called [[quark]]s. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with charge +{{sfrac|2|3}}) and one [[down quark]] (with a charge of \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.<ref name=pdg2002/><ref name=schombert2006/>\n\nThe quarks are held together by the [[strong interaction]] (or strong force), which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the [[nuclear force]], which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more).

Fermions obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] which prohibits ''[[identical particles|identical]]'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time.

As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons.<ref name=\"raymond\"/>\n\n[[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons.

This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.\n\nElectrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave\u2013particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]\u2014a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus.

The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon.

These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide.

The total number of these particles (called \"nucleons\") in a given atom is called the [[mass number]]. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is \"carbon-12,\" which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).\n\nThe actual [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s (Da), also called the unified atomic mass unit (u). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [[carbon-12]], which is approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.<ref name=iupac/> [[hydrogen atom|Hydrogen-1]] (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825&nbsp;Da.<ref name=chieh2001/> The value of this number is called the [[atomic mass]]. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14&nbsp;Da). However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 (see below).<ref name=nist_wc/> The heaviest [[stable atom]] is lead-208,<ref name=s131/> with a mass of {{val|207.9766521|u=Da}}.<ref name=audi2003/>\n\nAs even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [[Mole (unit)|moles]]. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]]). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1&nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]], each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12&nbsp;Da, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012&nbsp;kg.<ref name=iupac>{{cite book\n|last=Mills\n|first=Ian\n|author2=Cvita\u0161, Tomislav\n|author3=Homann, Klaus\n|author4=Kallay, Nikola\n|author5=Kuchitsu, Kozo\n|title=Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry\n|publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], Commission on Physiochemical Symbols Terminology and Units, Blackwell Scientific Publications\n|location=Oxford\n|edition=2nd\n|year=1993\n|isbn=978-0-632-03583-0\n|oclc=27011505\n|url=https://archive.org/details/quantitiesunitss0000unse/page/70\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/quantitiesunitss0000unse/page/70 70]\n|access-date=10 December 2011\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n===Shape and size===\n{{Main|Atomic radius}}\nAtoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [[atomic radius]].

Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1&nbsp;fm.<ref name=splung/>\n\nThe most common forms of radioactive decay are:<ref>{{cite book\n|last=L'Annunziata<!-- Note: the single quote mark before the name is correct. -->\n|first=Michael F.\n|year=2003|title=Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis\n|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-436603-9\n|oclc=16212955|pages=3\u201356}}</ref><ref name=firestone20000522/>\n* [[Alpha decay]]: this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]].\n* [[Beta decay]] (and [[electron capture]]): these processes are regulated by the [[weak force]], and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.\n* [[Gamma decay]]: this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.\n\nOther more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]]. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is [[internal conversion]]\u2014a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous [[nuclear fission]].\n\nEach [[radioactive isotope]] has a characteristic decay time period\u2014the [[half-life]]\u2014that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.<ref name=splung/>\n\n===Magnetic moment===\n{{Main|Electron magnetic moment|Nuclear magnetic moment}}\n\nElementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (\u0127), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin \u00bd&nbsp;\u0127, or \"spin-\u00bd\". In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.<ref name=hornak2006/>\n\nThe [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom\u2014its [[magnetic moment]]\u2014is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.<ref name=schroeder2/>\n\nIn [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.<ref name=schroeder2/><ref name=goebel20070901/>\n\nThe nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction\u2014a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]]. This has important applications in [[magnetic resonance imaging]].<ref name=yarris1997/><ref>{{cite book\n|last1=Liang|first1=Z.-P.|last2=Haacke|first2=E.M.\n|editor=Webster, J.G.|year=1999\n|volume=vol. 2\n|title=Encyclopedia of Electrical and Electronics Engineering: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n|publisher=John Wiley & Sons\n|isbn=978-0-471-13946-1|pages=412\u2013426}}</ref>\n\n===Energy levels===\n[[Image:Atomic orbital energy levels.svg|thumb|right|These electron's energy levels (not to scale) are sufficient for ground states of atoms up to [[cadmium]] (5s<sup>2</sup> 4d<sup>10</sup>) inclusively. Do not forget that even the top of the diagram is lower than an unbound electron state.]]\nThe [[potential energy]] of an electron in an atom is [[negative number|negative]], its dependence of its [[position (vector)|position]] reaches the [[minimum]] (the most [[absolute value]]) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the [[distance]] from the nucleus [[limit at infinity|goes to infinity]], roughly in an [[inverse proportion]] to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of [[quantum state|states]] centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific [[energy level]]; see [[time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the [[ionization potential|amount of energy needed to unbind]] the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. [[stationary state]], while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.<ref name=zeghbroeck1998/> The electron's energy raises when ''[[principal quantum number|n]]'' increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [[azimuthal quantum number|{{ell}}]] is caused not by [[electrostatic potential]] of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.\n\nFor an electron to [[atomic electron transition|transition between two different states]], e.g. [[ground state]] to first [[excited state]], it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to the [[Niels Bohr]] model, what can be precisely calculated by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\nElectrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see [[Atomic orbital|Electron properties]].\n\nThe energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Fowles|first=Grant R.|year=1989\n|title=Introduction to Modern Optics\n|publisher=Courier Dover Publications\n|isbn=978-0-486-65957-2\n|oclc=18834711|pages=227\u2013233}}\n</ref> Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.<ref name=martin2007/>\n\n[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum]]\n\nWhen a continuous [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum of energy]] is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[emission line]]s from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[atomic spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.<ref name=avogadro/>\n\nClose examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of [[spin\u2013orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.<ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/> When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.<ref name=weiss2001/> The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Beyer|first=H.F.\n|last2=Shevelko|first2=V.P.\n|year=2003\n|title=Introduction to the Physics of Highly Charged Ions\n|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0481-8\n|oclc=47150433|pages=232\u2013236}}</ref>\n\nIf a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [[stimulated emission]] of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [[laser]]s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.<ref name=watkins_sjsu/>\n\n===Valence and bonding behavior===\n{{Main|Valence (chemistry)|Chemical bond}}\n\nValency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds.<ref>oxford dictionary \u2013 valency</ref> The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the [[valence shell]], and the electrons in\nthat shell are called [[valence electron]]s. The number of valence electrons determines the [[chemical bond|bonding]]\nbehavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [[Chemical reaction|chemically react]] with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.<ref name=reusch20070716/> For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [[sodium chloride]] and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [[chemical bond]]ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [[organic compounds]].<ref name=chemguide/>\n\nThe [[chemical element]]s are often displayed in a [[periodic table]] that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [[noble gas]]es.<ref name=husted20031211/><ref name=baum2003/>\n\n===States===\n{{Main|State of matter|Phase (matter)}}\n\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|Graphic illustrating the formation of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]]]\nQuantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]].

These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide.

It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is \"carbon-12,\" which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).\n\nThe actual [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s (Da), also called the unified atomic mass unit (u).

This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1&nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram.

The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]].\n* [[Beta decay]] (and [[electron capture]]): these processes are regulated by the [[weak force]], and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.\n* [[Gamma decay]]: this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.\n\nOther more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]]. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is [[internal conversion]]\u2014a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous [[nuclear fission]].\n\nEach [[radioactive isotope]] has a characteristic decay time period\u2014the [[half-life]]\u2014that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life.

This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (\u0127), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin \u00bd&nbsp;\u0127, or \"spin-\u00bd\". In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.<ref name=hornak2006/>\n\nThe [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom\u2014its [[magnetic moment]]\u2014is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.<ref name=schroeder2/>\n\nIn [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.<ref name=schroeder2/><ref name=goebel20070901/>\n\nThe nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction\u2014a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]].

In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of [[quantum state|states]] centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific [[energy level]]; see [[time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the [[ionization potential|amount of energy needed to unbind]] the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. [[stationary state]], while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.<ref name=zeghbroeck1998/> The electron's energy raises when ''[[principal quantum number|n]]'' increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [[azimuthal quantum number|{{ell}}]] is caused not by [[electrostatic potential]] of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.\n\nFor an electron to [[atomic electron transition|transition between two different states]], e.g. [[ground state]] to first [[excited state]], it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to the [[Niels Bohr]] model, what can be precisely calculated by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\nElectrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see [[Atomic orbital|Electron properties]].\n\nThe energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Fowles|first=Grant R.|year=1989\n|title=Introduction to Modern Optics\n|publisher=Courier Dover Publications\n|isbn=978-0-486-65957-2\n|oclc=18834711|pages=227\u2013233}}\n</ref> Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.<ref name=martin2007/>\n\n[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum]]\n\nWhen a continuous [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum of energy]] is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[emission line]]s from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[atomic spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.<ref name=avogadro/>\n\nClose examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of [[spin\u2013orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.<ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/> When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.<ref name=weiss2001/> The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Beyer|first=H.F.\n|last2=Shevelko|first2=V.P.\n|year=2003\n|title=Introduction to the Physics of Highly Charged Ions\n|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0481-8\n|oclc=47150433|pages=232\u2013236}}</ref>\n\nIf a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [[stimulated emission]] of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized.

These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.<ref name=ns1728_77/><ref name=psT112_1_20/><ref name=ripin1998/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Exotic matter"}]}], "id": 33}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "{{Portal|Physics|Chemistry}}\n{{cmn|colwidth=21em|\n* [[History of quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Infinite divisibility]]\n* [[List of basic chemistry topics]]\n* [[Motion]]\n* [[Timeline of atomic and subatomic physics]]\n* [[Vector model of the atom]]\n* [[Nuclear model]]\n* [[Radioactive isotope]]\n}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Portal", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Physics"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Chemistry"}]}, {"name": "cmn", "values": [{"name": "colwidth", "value": "21em"}, {"name": "1", "value": "* [[History of quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Infinite divisibility]]\n* [[List of basic chemistry topics]]\n* [[Motion]]\n* [[Timeline of atomic and subatomic physics]]\n* [[Vector model of the atom]]\n* [[Nuclear model]]\n* [[Radioactive isotope]]"}]}], "id": 34}, {"title": "Notes", "paragraphs": "{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "reflist", "values": [{"name": "group", "value": "\"note\""}]}], "id": 35}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "<!-- this 'empty' section displays references defined elsewhere -->\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<!--Unused ref<ref name=leigh1990>{{cite book|editor=Leigh, G.J.|year=1990|title=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Commission on the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry, [[Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry]] \u2013 Recommendations 1990|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|isbn=0-08-022369-9|page=35|location=Oxford|quote=An atom is the smallest unit quantity of an element that is capable of existence whether alone or in chemical combination with other atoms of the same or other elements.}}</ref>-->\n\n<!--ref name=slac_20090615>{{cite web|date=15 June 2009|title=Radioactive Decays|url=http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/theory/nuclearstability.html|publisher=[[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]|accessdate=4 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607115741/http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/theory/nuclearstability.html| archivedate= 7 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref-->\n\n<ref name=adp322_8_549>{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|year=1905|title=\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|volume=322|issue=8|pages=549\u2013560|language=German|url=http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/dokumente/einstein2.pdf|doi=10.1002/andp.19053220806|accessdate=4 February 2007|bibcode=1905AnP...322..549E|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718202731/http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/dokumente/einstein2.pdf|archive-date=18 July 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=lee_hoon1995>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Y.K.|year=1995|author2=Hoon, K.|title=Brownian Motion|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|publisher=[[Imperial College]]|accessdate=18 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218061408/http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|archivedate=18 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=e31_2_50>{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=G.|year=2007 |title=Jean Perrin and the triumph of the atomic doctrine|journal=[[Endeavour (journal)|Endeavour]]|volume=31|issue=2|pages=50\u201353|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2007.05.003|pmid=17602746}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=nobel1096>{{cite web|year=1906|title=J.J.
