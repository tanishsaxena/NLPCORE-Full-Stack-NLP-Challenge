participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences\u2014and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' of the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election|Franklin River Dam]].\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-7270-0827-7"}]}, {"name": "rp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "p187"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Results.aec.gov.au"}, {"name": "date", "value": "20 December 2007"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "25 April 2010"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "5 May 2010"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "\n===1977\u20131986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===\nThe Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties.

In 1980, this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the re-election of Janine Haines (SA).
