On the division of Cilicia it became the chief place of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]], with the title of Metropolis. It suffered dreadfully from an earthquake both in the time of [[Eastern Roman emperor]] [[Justinian I]], and, still more, in the reign of his successor [[Justin I]].

It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equaled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to their sources.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.\n\nA visit in December 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.\n\nA modest Turkish farming village ([[Dilekkaya, Kozan|Dilekkaya]]) lies to the southwest of the ancient city. A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee. Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field.  Inquire at the museum for a viewing.\n\nAnazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia.  The [[Sis (ancient city)|castle of Sis]] (modern [[Kozan, Adana]]) lies to the north while Tumlu Castle and [[Yilankale]] are to the south, and the fortresses of [[Amouda]] and [[Sarvandikar]] are to the east.\n\nIn 2013, excavations uncovered the first known colonnaded double-lane road of the ancient world, 34 meters wide and 2700 meters long, also uncovered the ruins of a church and a bathhouse.<ref name=\"dailysabah.com\">[https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2017/11/26/statue-of-hygieia-and-eros-uncovered-in-southern-turkey Statue of Hygieia and Eros uncovered in southern Turkey]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, archaeologists discovered a limestone statue of the goddess [[Hygieia]] and the god [[Eros]].
