It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in Paris and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s.\n\n[[Walter Damrosch]] had asked Gershwin to write a full concerto following the success of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924).<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/An-American-in-Paris-by-Gershwin \"''An American in Paris''\"], by Betsy Schwarm, ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''</ref> Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus [[celesta]], saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in [[Carnegie Hall]], with Damrosch conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |title=Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris |author=George Gershwin |website=Nyphil.org |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/newsroom/1314/Releases/gilbert-ozone-final.pdf Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: Makoto Ozone to Perform Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' in One-Night-Only Concert All-American Program Also to Include Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture and Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story'' Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'': April 22, 2014 at nyphil.org] Accessed June 20, 2017</ref> He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2983 | title = ''An American in Paris'': About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author=Richard Freed|authorlink=Richard Freed| access-date=December 5, 2012}}</ref> He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the 1928 George Gershwin music"}, {"name": "2", "value": "other uses"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2018"}]}, {"name": "Image frame", "values": [{"name": "content", "value": "<score vorbis=1>\n{ \\time 2/4\n\\key f \\major\n\n\\relative c'' {\n  \\acciaccatura b8\\mp( c-.) d,-. e4 |\n  \\acciaccatura b'8( c-.) d,-. e4 |\n  \\acciaccatura b'8( c-.) d,-. e-. d'-. |\n  c c,16 d e4 | \\acciaccatura b'8( c-.) d,-. e4 |\n  \\acciaccatura b'8( c_.) d,-. e-. d'-. |\n  e16-. e-. e-. e-. e8-. a-. | g4->( f)\n  }\n}\n</score>\n<br />{{Left|<score vorbis=1>\n{ \\time 2/4\n  \\clef bass\n  { \\partial 8 cis8->\\f-\\markup { \\italic scherzando } |\n    dis-> eis-> fis-> gis-> |\n    fis-. eis4-> dis8\\( | fis4 eis\\) |\n    \\acciaccatura eis8( dis-.) cis4. ~ cis\n    \\acciaccatura eis8( dis-.) | cis2\n  }\n}\n</score>}}"}, {"name": "pos", "value": "top"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Themes from ''An American in Paris''"}]}, {"name": "Left", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "<score vorbis=1>\n{ \\time 2/4\n  \\clef bass\n  { \\partial 8 cis8->\\f-\\markup { \\italic scherzando } |\n    dis-> eis-> fis-> gis-> |\n    fis-. eis4-> dis8\\( | fis4 eis\\) |\n    \\acciaccatura eis8( dis-.) cis4. ~ cis\n    \\acciaccatura eis8( dis-.) | cis2\n  }\n}\n</score>"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris"}, {"name": "author", "value": "George Gershwin"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Nyphil.org"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "April 6, 2016"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "March 4, 2016"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2983"}, {"name": "title", "value": "''An American in Paris'': About the Work"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[The Kennedy Center]]"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Richard Freed"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Richard Freed"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "December 5, 2012"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Background", "paragraphs": "Although the story is likely apocryphal,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gershwin_his_life_and_music.html?id=EkOfAAAAMAAJ |title=George Gershwin: His Life and Music |last=Schwartz|first=Charles|date=1973|isbn=9780672516627 }}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref> Gershwin is said to have been attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]'s unusual chords, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel.

Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, \"It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears.

The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to \"supervise\" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D and a lower A.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[RCA Victor]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.
