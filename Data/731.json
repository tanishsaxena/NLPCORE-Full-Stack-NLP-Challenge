It was also expensive for the Crown to pay so many grand dukes each year. Each one received an annual salary of 250,000 rubles, and grand duchesses received a dowry of a million when they married. He limited the title of grand duke and duchess to only children and male-line grandchildren of emperors. The rest would bear a princely title and the style of [[Serene Highness]].

On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took Pobedonostsev's advice and cancelled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his [[autocracy]] would not be limited.\n\nAll of Alexander III's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]] (the ideology introduced by his grandfather, emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]) would save Russia from revolutionary agitation.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlexander weakened the power of the ''[[zemstvo]]'' (elective local administrative bodies) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These \"land captains\" (''zemskiye nachalniki'') were feared and resented throughout the Empire's peasant communities. These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperor's personal control. In such policies Alexander III followed the advice of  [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod (from 1880 to 1905) and who became tutor to Alexander's son and heir, Nicholas. (Pobedonostsev appears as \"Toporov\" in Tolstoy's novel ''Resurrection''.) Other conservative advisors included Count [[Dmitry Tolstoy|D. A. Tolstoy]] (minister of education, and later of internal affairs) and [[Ivan Durnovo|I. N. Durnovo]] (D. A. Tolstoy's successor in the latter post).

That alliance brought France out of diplomatic isolation, and moved Russia from the German orbit to a coalition with France, one that was strongly supported by French financial assistance to Russia's economic modernization.

However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (for whom the Tsar had an immense dislike), and the unwillingness of Wilhelm II's government to renew the treaty. In response Alexander III then began cordial relations with France, eventually entering into an [[Franco-Russian Alliance|alliance]] with the French in 1892.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing; 2003) p. 162</ref>\n\nDespite chilly relations with Berlin, the Tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]] and afterwards of [[Stefan Stambolov|Stambolov]] to destroy Russian influence in the principality roused his indignation, but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.<ref>Charles Jelavich, \"Russo-Bulgarian relations, 1892-1896: with particular reference to the problem of the bulgarian succession.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 24.4 (1952): 341-351.

His reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of [[History of Russia|Russian history]]; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}\n\nAlexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at [[Langinkoski]] manor near [[Kotka]] on the [[Finland|Finnish]] coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.\n\nAlexander deprecated foreign influence, German influence in particular, thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a Russia homogeneous in language, administration and religion. These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the [[Slavophiles]] and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n[[File:France-russe1896.jpg|thumb|Alexander III and Nicholas II on French stamps, c. 1896]]\nSome differences between father and son had first appeared during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], when Alexander II supported the cabinet of [[Berlin]] while the [[Tsesarevich]] made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. These sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879, when the [[Eastern Question]] excited Russian society. At first the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his [[phlegmatic]] nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]], where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the [[Congress of Berlin]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor. In return for the Russian support which had enabled him to create the [[German Empire]], {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with Russian interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of \"honest broker\" at the Congress, and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with [[Austria-Hungary]] for the purpose of counteracting Russian designs in [[Eastern Europe]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\nThe Tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n=== Family life ===\n[[File:Tzar Alexander III and members of the Royal family.jpg|thumb|Left to Right: Emperor Alexander III, Prince George (later [[George V|George V of the United Kingdom]]), [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna]], [[Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark|Maria of Greece]], Tsesarevich Nicholas (Later Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]]). Probably taken on the imperial yacht near Denmark, {{c.}} 1893.]]\n\nFollowing his father's assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the Winter Palace. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the [[Gatchina Palace]], located twenty miles south of St. Petersburg, making it his primary residence. Under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the [[Anichkov Palace]], as opposed to the Winter Palace.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the 1860s Alexander fell madly in love with his mother's lady-in-waiting, Princess Maria Elimovna Meshcherskaya. Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in early 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved \"Dusenka\". On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his fourth cousin. Before then, she had been the fianc\u00e9e of his late elder brother Nicholas. At first Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and wanted to marry Maria. In response the enraged emperor ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary \"Farewell, dear Dusenka.\" Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova. Almost a year after her first appearance in Paris, [[Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince of San Donato|Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince di San Donato]], fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867. Maria would die giving birth to her son [[Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince of San Donato|Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince di San Donato]]. Alexander's reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlexander soon grew fond of Dagmar and had six children by her, five of whom survived into adulthood: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] (b. 1868), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (b. 1871), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (b. 1875), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (b. 1878) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (b. 1882). Of his five surviving children, he was closest to his youngest two. In 1885 it was Alexander who commissioned [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]] to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled Easter eggs (now called \"[[Faberg\u00e9 egg]]s\") for her as an Easter gift, the [[First Hen egg]], which delighted her immensely and became an annual Easter tradition for Alexander and, upon his succession, for his son Nicholas as well.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:Marble Palace (oriental frontage).jpg|thumb|left|The equestrian statue of Alexander III, by Prince [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]], shows the Emperor sitting heavily on the back of a ponderous horse]]\n\nEach summer his parents-in-law, [[King Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]], held family reunions at the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]], bringing Alexander, Maria and their children to Denmark.<ref name=\":0\">Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003), p. 151</ref> His sister-in-law, the [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]], would come from Great Britain with some of her children, and his brother-in-law, [[King George I of Greece]], his wife, [[Queen Olga of Greece|Queen Olga]], who was a first cousin of Alexander and a Romanov Grand Duchess by birth, came with their children from Athens.<ref name=\":0\" /> In contrast to the strict security observed in Russia, Alexander and Maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in Denmark, Alexander once commenting to the Prince and Princess of Wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in England, while he was returning to his Russian prison.<ref name=\"Van Der Kiste, p. 152\">Van Der Kiste, p. 152</ref> In Denmark, he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles, sneaking into his father-in-law's orchard to steal apples, and playing pranks, such as turning a water hose on the visiting [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden]].<ref name=\"Van Der Kiste, p. 152\"/>\n\nAs Tsesarevich&mdash;and then as Tsar&mdash;Alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir]].

On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took Pobedonostsev's advice and cancelled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his [[autocracy]] would not be limited.\n\nAll of Alexander III's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]] (the ideology introduced by his grandfather, emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]) would save Russia from revolutionary agitation.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlexander weakened the power of the ''[[zemstvo]]'' (elective local administrative bodies) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These \"land captains\" (''zemskiye nachalniki'') were feared and resented throughout the Empire's peasant communities. These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperor's personal control. In such policies Alexander III followed the advice of  [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod (from 1880 to 1905) and who became tutor to Alexander's son and heir, Nicholas. (Pobedonostsev appears as \"Toporov\" in Tolstoy's novel ''Resurrection''.) Other conservative advisors included Count [[Dmitry Tolstoy|D. A.

However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (for whom the Tsar had an immense dislike), and the unwillingness of Wilhelm II's government to renew the treaty. In response Alexander III then began cordial relations with France, eventually entering into an [[Franco-Russian Alliance|alliance]] with the French in 1892.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing; 2003) p. 162</ref>\n\nDespite chilly relations with Berlin, the Tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]] and afterwards of [[Stefan Stambolov|Stambolov]] to destroy Russian influence in the principality roused his indignation, but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.<ref>Charles Jelavich, \"Russo-Bulgarian relations, 1892-1896: with particular reference to the problem of the bulgarian succession.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 24.4 (1952): 341-351.

His reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of [[History of Russia|Russian history]]; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}\n\nAlexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at [[Langinkoski]] manor near [[Kotka]] on the [[Finland|Finnish]] coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.\n\nAlexander deprecated foreign influence, German influence in particular, thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a Russia homogeneous in language, administration and religion. These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the [[Slavophiles]] and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n[[File:France-russe1896.jpg|thumb|Alexander III and Nicholas II on French stamps, c. 1896]]\nSome differences between father and son had first appeared during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], when Alexander II supported the cabinet of [[Berlin]] while the [[Tsesarevich]] made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. These sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879, when the [[Eastern Question]] excited Russian society. At first the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his [[phlegmatic]] nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]], where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the [[Congress of Berlin]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor. In return for the Russian support which had enabled him to create the [[German Empire]], {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with Russian interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of \"honest broker\" at the Congress, and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with [[Austria-Hungary]] for the purpose of counteracting Russian designs in [[Eastern Europe]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\nThe Tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Foreign policy of the Russian Empire"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "S.

Probably taken on the imperial yacht near Denmark, {{c.}} 1893.]]\n\nFollowing his father's assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the Winter Palace. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the [[Gatchina Palace]], located twenty miles south of St. Petersburg, making it his primary residence. Under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the [[Anichkov Palace]], as opposed to the Winter Palace.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the 1860s Alexander fell madly in love with his mother's lady-in-waiting, Princess Maria Elimovna Meshcherskaya. Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in early 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved \"Dusenka\". On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his fourth cousin. Before then, she had been the fianc\u00e9e of his late elder brother Nicholas. At first Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and wanted to marry Maria. In response the enraged emperor ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary \"Farewell, dear Dusenka.\" Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova. Almost a year after her first appearance in Paris, [[Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince of San Donato|Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince di San Donato]], fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867. Maria would die giving birth to her son [[Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince of San Donato|Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince di San Donato]]. Alexander's reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlexander soon grew fond of Dagmar and had six children by her, five of whom survived into adulthood: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] (b. 1868), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (b. 1871), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (b. 1875), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (b. 1878) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (b. 1882). Of his five surviving children, he was closest to his youngest two. In 1885 it was Alexander who commissioned [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]] to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled Easter eggs (now called \"[[Faberg\u00e9 egg]]s\") for her as an Easter gift, the [[First Hen egg]], which delighted her immensely and became an annual Easter tradition for Alexander and, upon his succession, for his son Nicholas as well.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:Marble Palace (oriental frontage).jpg|thumb|left|The equestrian statue of Alexander III, by Prince [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]], shows the Emperor sitting heavily on the back of a ponderous horse]]\n\nEach summer his parents-in-law, [[King Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]], held family reunions at the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]], bringing Alexander, Maria and their children to Denmark.<ref name=\":0\">Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003), p. 151</ref> His sister-in-law, the [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]], would come from Great Britain with some of her children, and his brother-in-law, [[King George I of Greece]], his wife, [[Queen Olga of Greece|Queen Olga]], who was a first cousin of Alexander and a Romanov Grand Duchess by birth, came with their children from Athens.<ref name=\":0\" /> In contrast to the strict security observed in Russia, Alexander and Maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in Denmark, Alexander once commenting to the Prince and Princess of Wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in England, while he was returning to his Russian prison.<ref name=\"Van Der Kiste, p. 152\">Van Der Kiste, p. 152</ref> In Denmark, he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles, sneaking into his father-in-law's orchard to steal apples, and playing pranks, such as turning a water hose on the visiting [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden]].<ref name=\"Van Der Kiste, p. 152\"/>\n\nAs Tsesarevich&mdash;and then as Tsar&mdash;Alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir]].
