The middle chronology, however, is under attack, with various scholars arguing strongly in favor of a low(er) chronology and for various reasons. Without going into detail, Boese has placed Sargon's accession at shortly after 2250 (1982), Gasche, Armstrong, Cole and Gurzadyan at 2200 (1998) and Reade at 2180 (2001), with the Third Dynasty of Ur moved according.\"</ref> Under Sargon and his successors, the Akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as [[Elam]] and [[Gutian people|Gutium]].

In no case is the Akkad empire an absolute novelty [...] 'Akkad the first empire' is therefore subject to criticism not only as for the adjective 'first' but especially as for the noun

Although the city of Akkad has not yet been identified on the ground, it is known from various textual sources. Among these is at least one text predating the reign of Sargon.

The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]. One legend related to Sargon in Assyrian times says that\n{{quote|My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.<ref name=Roux />}}\n\nLater claims made on behalf of Sargon were that his mother was an \"entu\" priestess (high priestess). The claims might have been made to ensure a descendancy of nobility, considering only a highly placed family can be made such a position.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

The royal cupbearer at this time was in fact a prominent political position, close to the king and with various high level responsibilities not suggested by the title of the position itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sargon|doi = 10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e1101500}}</ref> This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers.

This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of [[Assyria]] and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.\n\nImages of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against [[Canaan]] and against [[Sarlak]], king of [[Gutian period|Gutium]]. He also boasted of having subjugated the \"four-quarters\"&nbsp;\u2014 the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Assyria), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam), and the west ([[Amorites|Martu]]). Some of the earliest historiographic texts ([[Babylonian Chronicles|ABC 19, 20]]) suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon (''Bab-ilu'') in its new location near Akkad.<ref>Dalley proposes that these sources may have originally referred to [[Sargon II]] of the Assyria rather than Sargon of Akkad.

He called himself \"The anointed priest of [[Anu]]\" and \"the great'' ensi'' of [[Enlil]]\" and his daughter, [[Enheduanna]], was installed as priestess to [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] at the temple in [[Ur]].\n\n[[File:P1150890 Louvre st\u00e8le de victoire Akkad AO2678 rwk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Akkadian soldiers slaying enemies, circa 2300 BC.]]\nTroubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states:\n{{quote|In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad (the city) [but] he went forth to battle and defeated them, he knocked them over and destroyed their vast army.}}\n\nIt refers to his campaign in \"Elam\", where he defeated a coalition army led by the King of Awan and forced the vanquished to become his vassals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely and soon brought about [[famine]] and rocketing grain prices. The Sumerian king [[Ur-Nammu]] (2112\u20132095 BC) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.\n\nThe ''Sumerian King List'', describing the Akkadian Empire after the death of Shar-kali-shari, states:\n{{quote|Who was king?

The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. [[Nomad]]ic herders such as the [[Amorite]]s moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with Akkadian populations. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"Weiss1993\" />\n\nThis collapse of rain-fed agriculture in the Upper Country meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} wall known as the \"Repeller of the Amorites\" between the Tigris and Euphrates under the Ur III ruler [[Shu-Suen|Shu-Sin]].

The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]. One legend related to Sargon in Assyrian times says that\n{{quote|My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills.

The royal cupbearer at this time was in fact a prominent political position, close to the king and with various high level responsibilities not suggested by the title of the position itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sargon|doi = 10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e1101500}}</ref> This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers.

This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of [[Assyria]] and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.\n\nImages of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against [[Canaan]] and against [[Sarlak]], king of [[Gutian period|Gutium]]. He also boasted of having subjugated the \"four-quarters\"&nbsp;\u2014 the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Assyria), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam), and the west ([[Amorites|Martu]]). Some of the earliest historiographic texts ([[Babylonian Chronicles|ABC 19, 20]]) suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon (''Bab-ilu'') in its new location near Akkad.<ref>Dalley proposes that these sources may have originally referred to [[Sargon II]] of the Assyria rather than Sargon of Akkad.

The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. [[Nomad]]ic herders such as the [[Amorite]]s moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with Akkadian populations. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"Weiss1993\" />\n\nThis collapse of rain-fed agriculture in the Upper Country meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} wall known as the \"Repeller of the Amorites\" between the Tigris and Euphrates under the Ur III ruler [[Shu-Suen|Shu-Sin]].

The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. [[Nomad]]ic herders such as the [[Amorite]]s moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with Akkadian populations. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"Weiss1993\" />\n\nThis collapse of rain-fed agriculture in the Upper Country meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} wall known as the \"Repeller of the Amorites\" between the Tigris and Euphrates under the Ur III ruler [[Shu-Suen|Shu-Sin]]. Such attempts led to increased political instability; meanwhile, severe depression occurred to re-establish [[Demography|demographic equilibrium]] with the less favourable climatic conditions.<ref>Christie, Peter (2008) ''The Curse of Akkad: Climate Upheavals that Rocked Human History'', Annick Press, pp. 31\u201348</ref><ref>[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Papers_files/deMenocal.2001.pdf Cultural Responses to Climate Change During the Late Holocene], Peter B. deMenocal, ''Science'', 27 April 2001, Vol. 292 no. 5517 pp. 667\u2013673 {{doi|10.1126/science.1059287}}</ref><ref>\"[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Papers_files/Cullen.et.al.2000.pdf Climate change and the collapse of the Akkadian empire:  Evidence from the deep sea]\"; ''Geology'' 28(4), April 2000.</ref>\n\n[[Richard L.

Traditionally, the ''ensi'' was the highest functionary of the Sumerian [[city-state]]s. In later traditions, one became an ''ensi'' by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.\n\nInitially, the monarchical ''lugal'' (''lu'' = man, ''gal'' =Great) was subordinate to the priestly ''ensi'', and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the ''lugal'' who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own ''\"\u00e9\"'' (= house) or \"palace\", independent from the temple establishment. By the time of [[Mesalim]], whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.\n\nAs Sargon extended his conquest from the \"Lower Sea\" (Persian Gulf), to the \"Upper Sea\" (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled \"the totality of the lands under heaven\", or \"from sunrise to sunset\", as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ''ensi''s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' became recognised as meaning \"lord of the universe\". Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to [[Dilmun]] ([[Bahrain]]) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history.  Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of [[Keftiu|Kaptara]] (possibly [[Cyprus]]), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.\n\nWith Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called \"Lord of the Four-Quarters (of the Earth)\", but also elevated to the ranks of the ''dingir'' (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like [[Gilgamesh]], become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.<ref>Leick, Gwendolyn (2001) \"Mesopotamia: Invention of the City\" (Penguin Books)</ref>\n\nOne strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ''ensi'' governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire ([[Urkesh]] and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.<ref>[http://128.97.6.202/attach/Buccellati%202002%20Taram%20Agade%20Daughter%20of%20Naram%20Sin.pdf] Tar'am-Agade, Daughter of Naram-Sin, at Urkesh, Buccellati, Giorgio and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, in of Pots and Plans.

Before the Akkadian period the progressive [[soil salinity|salinisation]] of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of [[wheat]] in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant [[barley]] growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and [[demography|demographic pressures]] were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the [[Stele of the Vultures]] of [[Eannatum]]). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite.<ref>Thompson, William J. (2003), \"Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation,\" ''Journal of World Systems Research''</ref> It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.\n\n[[File:Murex Rimush Louvre AO21404.jpg|thumb|left|Sea shell of a [[murex]] bearing the name of [[Rimush]], king of Kish, {{circa|lk=no|2270}} BC, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by [[Canaanites]] to make a purple dye.]]\nThe [[water table]] in this region was very high and replenished regularly\u2014by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October\u2014a period of food shortage\u2014under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Gwendolyn Leick has<ref>Leick Gwendolyn (2003), \"Mesopotamia: The invention of the city\" (Penguin)</ref> suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, \"Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival\u20145,400 warriors ate bread daily before him\".<ref>Kramer 1963:324, quoted in Charles Keith Maisels, ''The Emergence of Civilization'' ch. \"The institutions of urbanism\", 1990:179.</ref>\n\nHarvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. [[Nomad]]ic [[Amorites]] from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the [[crop residue]] and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in [[wool]], [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[cheese]] to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bourke|first1=Stephen|title=The Middle East: the cradle of civilization revealed|date=2008|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=9780500251478|page=89}}</ref> and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.\n\n===Foreign trade===\n[[File:Moyen_Orient_3mil_aC.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Location of foreign lands for the Mesopotamians, including [[Elam]], [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Dilmun]], [[Marhashi]] and [[Meluhha]].]]\n{{see also|Indus-Mesopotamia relations}}\nAs a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported.

A third work, the ''Temple Hymns'', a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated.
