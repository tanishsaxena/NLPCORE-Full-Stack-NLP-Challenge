(ed.), ''Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah''. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.</ref>). The name \"''Allosaurus\"'' means \"different lizard\" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its discovery). It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|allos}}'') (\"different, other\") and {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}'') (\"lizard / generic reptile\"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of [[paleontology|paleontological]] circles.\n\n''Allosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]]. Its [[skull]] was large and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated [[tooth|teeth]]. It averaged {{convert|9.5|m}} in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr =on}}. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. It is classified as an [[allosaurid]], a type of [[carnosauria]]n theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and includes 5-6 valid [[species]] (later whittled down to three valid species as of 2020), the best known of which is ''A. fragilis''. The bulk of ''Allosaurus'' remains have come from [[North America]]'s [[Morrison Formation]], with material also known from [[Portugal]]. It was known for over half of the 20th century as ''[[Antrodemus]]'', but a study of the copious remains from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] brought the name \"''Allosaurus\"'' back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.\n\nAs the most abundant large predator in the [[Morrison Formation]], ''Allosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included [[ornithopod]]s, [[stegosaurid]]s, and [[sauropod]]s. Some paleontologists interpret ''Allosaurus'' as having had cooperative [[social behavior]], and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Genus of large theropod dinosaur"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "Automatic taxobox\n", "values": [{"name": "fossil_range", "value": "[[Late Jurassic]], {{Geological range|155|145}}"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Allosaurus SDNHM (1).jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "Mounted ''A. fragilis'' skeleton cast, [[San Diego Natural History Museum]]"}, {"name": "image_upright", "value": "1.15"}, {"name": "parent_authority", "value": "[[Othniel Marsh|Marsh]], [[1878 in paleontology|1878]]"}, {"name": "taxon", "value": "Allosaurus"}, {"name": "authority", "value": "Marsh, [[1877 in paleontology|1877]]"}, {"name": "type_species", "value": "{{extinct}}'''''Allosaurus fragilis'''''"}, {"name": "type_species_authority", "value": "Marsh, 1877"}, {"name": "subdivision_ranks", "value": "Species"}, {"name": "subdivision_ref", "value": "<ref name=DJC20/>"}, {"name": "subdivision", "value": "{{bold species list\n|{{extinct}}A. fragilis|Marsh, 1877\n|{{extinct}}A. europaeus|Mateus ''et al.'', [[2006 in paleontology|2006]]\n|{{extinct}}A. jimmadseni|Chure & Loewen, [[2020 in paleontology|2020]]\n}}"}, {"name": "synonyms", "value": "*''[[Antrodemus]]''? <small>[[Joseph Leidy|Leidy]], [[1870 in paleontology|1870]]</small>\n*''Creosaurus''? <small>Marsh, [[1878 in paleontology|1878]]</small>\n*''[[Epanterias]]''? <small>[[Edward Drinker Cope|Cope]], 1878</small>\n*''Labrosaurus''? <small>Marsh, [[1879 in paleontology|1879]]</small>\n*\"Madsenius\" <small>[[Robert Bakker|Bakker]], [[1990 in paleontology|1990]]</small>\n*''[[Saurophaganax]]''? <small>Chure, [[1995 in paleontology|1995]]</small>\n*\"Wyomingraptor\" <small>Bakker, [[1997 in paleontology|1997]]</small>"}]}, {"name": "Geological range", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "155"}, {"name": "2", "value": "145"}]}, {"name": "bold species list\n", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{extinct}}A. fragilis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Marsh, 1877"}, {"name": "3", "value": "{{extinct}}A. europaeus"}, {"name": "4", "value": "Mateus ''et al.'', [[2006 in paleontology|2006]]"}, {"name": "5", "value": "{{extinct}}A. jimmadseni"}, {"name": "6", "value": "Chure & Loewen, [[2020 in paleontology|2020]]"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u02cc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6"}, {"name": "3", "value": "l"}, {"name": "4", "value": "\u0259"}, {"name": "5", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "6", "value": "s"}, {"name": "7", "value": "\u0254\u02d0r"}, {"name": "8", "value": "\u0259"}, {"name": "9", "value": "s"}]}, {"name": "MerriamWebsterDictionary", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Allosaurus"}]}, {"name": "Dictionary.com", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Allosaurus"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc-Latn"}, {"name": "2", "value": "allos"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc-Latn"}, {"name": "2", "value": "sauros"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "9.5"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "12"}, {"name": "2", "value": "m"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Description", "paragraphs": "[[File:Allosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|The size range of ''Allosaurus'' compared with a human.]]\n''Allosaurus'' was a typical large [[theropod]], having a massive [[skull]] on a short [[neck]], a long, slightly sloping [[tail]] and reduced forelimbs.

The first described [[fossil]] in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]] in 1869. It came from [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park]], near [[Granby, Colorado]], probably from [[Morrison Formation]] rocks. The locals had identified such bones as \"petrified [[horse]] hoofs\".

[[Othniel Charles Marsh]] gave these remains the formal name ''Allosaurus fragilis'' in 1877. ''Allosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''allos/\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2'', meaning \"strange\" or \"different\" and ''sauros/\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2'', meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Liddell & Scott|year=1980|title=Greek\u2013English Lexicon, Abridged Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-910207-5|oclc=17396377|url=https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd}}</ref> It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery.<ref name=OCM77>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1877 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles from the Jurassic formation |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=14 |issue=84 |pages=514\u2013516 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-14.84.514|bibcode=1877AmJS...14..514M }}</ref><ref name=DMLomnipedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |title=Dinosauria Translation and Pronunciation Guide A |accessdate=11 September 2007 |author=Creisler, Ben |date=7 July 2003 |publisher=Dinosauria On-Line |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105101204/http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |archivedate=5 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The species epithet ''fragilis'' is [[Latin]] for \"fragile\", referring to lightening features in the vertebrae.

It came from [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park]], near [[Granby, Colorado]], probably from [[Morrison Formation]] rocks. The locals had identified such bones as \"petrified [[horse]] hoofs\".

[[Othniel Charles Marsh]] gave these remains the formal name ''Allosaurus fragilis'' in 1877. ''Allosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''allos/\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2'', meaning \"strange\" or \"different\" and ''sauros/\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2'', meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Liddell & Scott|year=1980|title=Greek\u2013English Lexicon, Abridged Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-910207-5|oclc=17396377|url=https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd}}</ref> It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery.<ref name=OCM77>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1877 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles from the Jurassic formation |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=14 |issue=84 |pages=514\u2013516 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-14.84.514|bibcode=1877AmJS...14..514M }}</ref><ref name=DMLomnipedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |title=Dinosauria Translation and Pronunciation Guide A |accessdate=11 September 2007 |author=Creisler, Ben |date=7 July 2003 |publisher=Dinosauria On-Line |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105101204/http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |archivedate=5 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The species epithet ''fragilis'' is [[Latin]] for \"fragile\", referring to lightening features in the vertebrae.

[[Robert T.

Although ''Allosaurus'' did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a [[saw]]-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.<ref name=BB98/>\n[[File:Allosaurus Jaws Steveoc86.jpg|thumb|''Allosaurus'' attacking, based on the theories of [[Robert T.

The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among [[vertebrate]]s in general, and modern [[diapsid]] carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple ''Allosaurus'' individuals at the same site, e.g. in the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland\u2013Lloyd Quarry]], are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that ''Allosaurus'' individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like [[crocodile]]s and [[Komodo dragon]]s.

Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or [[animal migration|migration]], resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. ''Allosaurus'' was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that ''Allosaurus'' had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' or ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones \"were distributed to the [[proximal]] [[phalanges]]\" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in \"statistically indistinguishable\" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined ''Allosaurus'' fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in ''Allosaurus'' provide evidence for \"very active\" predation-based rather than scavenging diets.<ref name=\"rothschild-dino\">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

[[Robert T. Bakker]], comparing ''Allosaurus'' to [[Cenozoic]] sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although ''Allosaurus'' did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a [[saw]]-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.<ref name=BB98/>\n[[File:Allosaurus Jaws Steveoc86.jpg|thumb|''Allosaurus'' attacking, based on the theories of [[Robert T.

According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 8,724&nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]],<ref name=ERetal01/><ref name=\"BatesFalkingham2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=K.

They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods.<ref name=ERetal01/> Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey.<ref name=FK02>{{cite journal |last=Frazzetta |first=T.

This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later.<ref name=HMC04/> An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea.<ref name=JF07/> This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey.<ref name=KC02/> Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager ''et al.'' from the University of Bristol also indicate ''Allosaurus'' could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with ''Tyrannosaurus'' and the therizinosaurid ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' in the same study, it was found that ''Allosaurus'' had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 92 degree angle at maximum. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lautenschlager |first= Stephan |title= Estimating cranial musculoskeletal constraints in theropod dinosaurs |volume= 2 |issue= 11 |pages= 150495 |journal= Royal Society Open Science|date=2015-11-04 |doi= 10.1098/rsos.150495 |pmid= 26716007 |pmc= 4680622 |bibcode= 2015RSOS....250495L }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151103213705.htm |title= Better to eat you with?

This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal's capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to [[falcon]]s, such as [[kestrel]]s: the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh.

The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among [[vertebrate]]s in general, and modern [[diapsid]] carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple ''Allosaurus'' individuals at the same site, e.g. in the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland\u2013Lloyd Quarry]], are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that ''Allosaurus'' individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like [[crocodile]]s and [[Komodo dragon]]s.

Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or [[animal migration|migration]], resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. ''Allosaurus'' was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that ''Allosaurus'' had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' or ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones \"were distributed to the [[proximal]] [[phalanges]]\" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in \"statistically indistinguishable\" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined ''Allosaurus'' fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in ''Allosaurus'' provide evidence for \"very active\" predation-based rather than scavenging diets.<ref name=\"rothschild-dino\">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.
