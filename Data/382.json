Saturday is a traditional day of prayer for the dead, because Christ lay dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on Saturday.\n\nThese days are devoted to prayer for departed relatives and others among the faithful who would not be commemorated specifically as saints. The [[Divine Services]] on these days have special hymns added to them to commemorate the departed. There is oftena [[Panikhida]] (Memorial Service) either after the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Saturday morning or after [[Vespers]] on Friday evening, for which [[Koliva]] (a dish made of boiled wheatberries or rice and honey) is prepared and placed on the Panikhida table. After the Service, the priest blesses the Koliva.

During World War I, given the great number of war dead and the many destroyed churches where mass could no longer be said, [[Pope Benedict XV]], granted all priests the privilege of offering three Masses on All Souls Day,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/all-saints-and-all-souls.html|title=All Saints and All Souls|first=Super|last=User|website=www.catholiceducation.org}}</ref> a permission that still stands.\n\n====Liturgical practice====\nIn the Roman Rite as revised in 1969, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is that of the Sunday. However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. While celebration of a Sunday, a solemnity or a feast of the Lord replacing a Sunday begins on the previous evening with Vespers and perhaps evening Mass, the general norms do not allow for anticipation on Saturday evening of the liturgy of All Souls' Day falling on a Sunday, and so they suggest that the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would be celebrated on that evening.<ref name=ZENIT/><ref>Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, \"Table of Liturgical Days\"]</ref> However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls; in countries such as Italy the situation was less clear.<ref name=ZENIT14>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-day-and-the-vigil-mass|title=Edward McNamara, \"All Souls' Day and the Vigil Mass\"|date=29 October 2014 |work=ZENIT \u2013 The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn countries where All Saints' Day is not a [[holy day of obligation]] attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation.<ref name=ZENIT/> In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November.<ref name=ZENIT14/> In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November.\n\nIn [[Divine Worship: The Missal]] the minor propers (Introit, Gradual, Tract, Sequence, Offertory, and Communion) are those used for Renaissance and Classical musical [[requiem]] settings, including the [[Dies Irae]].  This permits the performance of traditional requiem settings in the context of the Divine Worship Form of the Roman Rite on All Souls Day as well as at funerals, votive celebrations of all faithful departed, and anniversaries of deaths.<ref>''Divine Worship: The Missal'', pp.871\u2013875 & pp.1024\u20131032</ref>\n\n====All Souls' indulgence====\nAccording to The Enchiridion of Indulgences, \nAn indulgence, applicable only to the souls in purgatory, is granted to the faithful, who devoutly visit a cemetery and pray for the departed.

However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. While celebration of a Sunday, a solemnity or a feast of the Lord replacing a Sunday begins on the previous evening with Vespers and perhaps evening Mass, the general norms do not allow for anticipation on Saturday evening of the liturgy of All Souls' Day falling on a Sunday, and so they suggest that the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would be celebrated on that evening.<ref name=ZENIT/><ref>Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, \"Table of Liturgical Days\"]</ref> However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls; in countries such as Italy the situation was less clear.<ref name=ZENIT14>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-day-and-the-vigil-mass|title=Edward McNamara, \"All Souls' Day and the Vigil Mass\"|date=29 October 2014 |work=ZENIT \u2013 The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn countries where All Saints' Day is not a [[holy day of obligation]] attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation.<ref name=ZENIT/> In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November.<ref name=ZENIT14/> In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November.\n\nIn [[Divine Worship: The Missal]] the minor propers (Introit, Gradual, Tract, Sequence, Offertory, and Communion) are those used for Renaissance and Classical musical [[requiem]] settings, including the [[Dies Irae]].  This permits the performance of traditional requiem settings in the context of the Divine Worship Form of the Roman Rite on All Souls Day as well as at funerals, votive celebrations of all faithful departed, and anniversaries of deaths.<ref>''Divine Worship: The Missal'', pp.871\u2013875 & pp.1024\u20131032</ref>\n\n====All Souls' indulgence====\nAccording to The Enchiridion of Indulgences, \nAn indulgence, applicable only to the souls in purgatory, is granted to the faithful, who devoutly visit a cemetery and pray for the departed.
