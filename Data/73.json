Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' Los Angeles County ''or'' New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the Academy.

Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) since the [[7th Academy Awards]] in 1935. The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |title=How Are Oscar Nominees Chosen? |date=January 24, 2017 |language=en |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180722072631/http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all|first = Sean|last = Hutchinson|work = Mental Floss}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |title=The men who are counting on Oscar |work=BBC News |first=Jackie |last=Finlay |date=March 3, 2006 |accessdate= April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter Meet the only two people in the world who already know all the Oscar winners {{!}} Market Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150240/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter |date=February 27, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nAll AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.\n\nNew membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members.

Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' Los Angeles County ''or'' New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the Academy. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in the Documentary category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/90aa_short_subject.pdf |title=Documentary Feature |work=90th Academy Awards: Special Rules for the Documentary Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426153720/http://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/90aa_short_subject.pdf |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]], as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]].

ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live in all U.S. time zones (excluding territories outside mainland North America), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971\u201375),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars\u00ae, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=August 31, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archivedate=February 2, 2017|url-status = live}}</ref> The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\n\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March in order to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting With A Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=2019-06-11|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live in all U.S. time zones (excluding territories outside mainland North America), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971\u201375),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars\u00ae, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=August 31, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archivedate=February 2, 2017|url-status = live}}</ref> The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\n\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March in order to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting With A Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=2019-06-11|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail).

categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.\n\nIn August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |title=Oscars Won't Televise All Awards, Adds Popular Film Category |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=August 8, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103125108/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |archive-date=November 3, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nFollowing dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live.
