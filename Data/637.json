A file is treated as a sequence of records, and by default each line is a record. Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on. '''An AWK program is a sequence of pattern-action statements'''. AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.\" - Alfred V. Aho<ref>{{cite web |first=Naomi |last=Hamilton |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2535126/the-a-z-of-programming-languages--awk.html |title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK |date=May 30, 2008 |work=[[Computerworld]] |accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAn AWK program is a series of pattern action pairs, written as:\n\n<source lang=\"awk\">\ncondition { action }\ncondition { action }\n...\n</source>\n\nwhere ''condition'' is typically an expression and ''action'' is a series of commands. The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn, and executes the ''action'' for each expression that is true. Either the ''condition'' or the ''action'' may be omitted. The ''condition'' defaults to matching every record. The default ''action'' is to print the record. This is the same pattern-action structure as sed.\n\nIn addition to a simple AWK expression, such as <code>foo == 1</code> or <code>/^foo/</code>, the ''condition'' can be <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> causing the ''action'' to be executed before or after all records have been read, or ''pattern1, pattern2'' which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches ''pattern1'' up to and including the record that matches ''pattern2'' before again trying to match against ''pattern1'' on future lines.\n\nIn addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator, <code>~</code>, which matches a [[regular expression]] against a string. As handy [[syntactic sugar]], ''/regexp/'' without using the tilde operator matches against the current record; this syntax derives from [[sed]], which in turn inherited it from the [[Ed (text editor)|ed]] editor,  where <code>/</code> is used for searching. This syntax of using slashes as [[delimiter]]s for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by Perl and ECMAScript, and is now quite common. The tilde operator was also adopted by Perl, but has not seen as wide use.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Naomi"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Hamilton"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/2535126/the-a-z-of-programming-languages--awk.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK"}, {"name": "date", "value": "May 30, 2008"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[Computerworld]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2008-12-12"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": " Commands ", "paragraphs": "\nAWK commands are the statements that are substituted for ''action'' in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of [[dynamically linked library|dynamically linked libraries]], which can also provide more functions.\n\n=== The ''print'' command ===\n\nThe ''print'' command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is:\n\n; <code>print</code>\n:This displays the contents of the current record. In AWK, records are broken down into ''fields'', and these can be displayed separately:\n; <code>print $1</code>\n: Displays the first field of the current record\n; <code>print $1, $3</code>\n: Displays the first and third fields of the current record, separated by a predefined string called the output field separator (OFS) whose default value is a single space character\n\nAlthough these fields (''$X'') may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in [[Perl]]), they actually refer to the fields of the current record.  A special case, ''$0'', refers to the entire record.  In fact, the commands \"<code>print</code>\" and \"<code>print $0</code>\" are identical in functionality.\n\nThe ''print'' command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print 3+2\n   print foobar(3)\n   print foobar(variable)\n   print sin(3-2)\n}\n</source>\n\nOutput may be sent to a file:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print \"expression\" > \"file name\"\n}\n</source>\n\nor through a [[pipe (Unix)|pipe]]:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print \"expression\" | \"command\"\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Built-in variables ===\n\nAwk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record.\n\nOther variables include:\n* <code>NR</code>: Keeps a current count of the number of input records.\n* <code>NF</code>: Keeps a count of the number of fields in an input record. The last field in the input record can be designated by $NF.\n* <code>FILENAME</code>: Contains the name of the current input-file.\n* <code>FS</code>: Contains the \"field separator\" character used to divide fields on the input record. The default, \"white space\", includes any space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character to change the field separator.\n* <code>RS</code>: Stores the current \"record separator\" character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a \"newline\".\n* <code>OFS</code>: Stores the \"output field separator\", which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a \"space\" character.\n* <code>ORS</code>: Stores the \"output record separator\", which separates the output records when Awk prints them. The default is a \"newline\" character.\n* <code>OFMT</code>: Stores the format for numeric output. The default format is \"%.6g\".\n\n=== Variables and syntax ===\n\nVariable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators ''+ - * /'' represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string [[concatenation]], simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between. Double quotes [[delimit]] string constants. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using ''#'' as the first character on a line.\n\n=== User-defined functions ===\n\nIn a format similar to [[C (programming language)|C]], function definitions consist of the keyword <code>function</code>, the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example of a function.\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nfunction add_three (number) {\n    return number + 3\n}\n</source>\n\nThis statement can be invoked as follows:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print add_three(36)     # Outputs '''39'''\n}\n</source>\n\nFunctions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function.

Since ''$4'' is the value of the fourth field, ''$NF'' is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has, or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines. $ is actually a unary operator with the highest [[operator precedence]]. (If the line has no fields, then ''NF'' is 0, ''$0'' is the whole line, which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space, and so has the numeric value 0.)\n\nAt the end of the input the ''END'' pattern matches, so ''s'' is printed. However, since there may have been no lines of input at all, in which case no value has ever been assigned to ''s'', it will by default be an empty string. Adding zero to a variable is an AWK idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value. (Concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string, e.g. ''s \"\"''.  Note, there's no operator to concatenate strings, they're just placed adjacently.) With the coercion the program prints \"0\" on an empty input, without it an empty line is printed.\n\n=== Match a range of input lines ===\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nNR % 4 == 1, NR % 4 == 3 { printf \"%6d  %s\\n\", NR, $0 }\n</source>\nThe action statement prints each line numbered. The printf function emulates the standard C [[printf]] and works similarly to the print command described above. The pattern to match, however, works as follows: ''NR'' is the number of records, typically lines of input, AWK has so far read, i.e. the current line number, starting at 1 for the first line of input. ''%'' is the [[modulo operation|modulo]] operator. ''NR % 4 == 1'' is true for the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., lines of input. Likewise, ''NR % 4 == 3'' is true for the 3rd, 7th, 11th, etc., lines of input. The range pattern is false until the first part matches, on line 1, and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches, on line 3. It then stays false until the first part matches again on line 5.\n\nThus, the program prints lines 1,2,3, skips line 4, and then 5,6,7, and so on. For each line, it prints the line number (on a 6 character-wide field) and then the line contents. For example, when executed on this input:\n Rome\n Florence\n Milan\n Naples\n Turin\n Venice\n\nThe previous program prints:\n      1 Rome\n      2 Florence\n      3 Milan\n      5 Turin\n      6 Venice\n\n==== Printing the initial or the final part of a file ====\nAs a special case, when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true, e.g. ''1'', the range will start at the beginning of the input. Similarly, if the second part is constantly false, e.g. ''0'', the range will continue until the end of input. For example,\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n /^--cut here--$/, 0\n</source>\nprints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression ''^--cut here--$'', that is, a line containing only the phrase \"--cut here--\", to the end.\n\n=== Calculate word frequencies ===\n\n[[Word frequency]] using [[associative array]]s:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nBEGIN {\n    FS=\"[^a-zA-Z]+\"\n}\n{\n    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++)\n          words[tolower($i)]++\n}\nEND {\n    for (i in words)\n         print i, words[i]\n}\n</source>\n\nThe BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. Note that separators can be regular expressions. After that, we get to a bare action, which performs the action on every input line. In this case, for every field on the line, we add one to the number of times that word, first converted to lowercase, appears. Finally, in the END block, we print the words with their frequencies. The line\n for (i in words)\ncreates a loop that goes through the array ''words'', setting ''i'' to each ''subscript'' of the array. This is different from most languages, where such a loop goes through each ''value'' in the array. The loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count. <code>tolower</code> was an addition to the One True awk (see below) made after the book was published.\n\n=== Match pattern from command line ===\n\nThis program can be represented in several ways. The first one uses the [[Bourne shell]] to make a shell script that does everything. It is the shortest of these methods:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\npattern=\"$1\"\nshift\nawk '/'\"$pattern\"'/ { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }' \"$@\"\n</source>\n\nThe <code>$pattern</code> in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces.  A pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line (<code>$0</code>) matches. <code>FILENAME</code> contains the current filename. awk has no explicit concatenation operator; two adjacent strings concatenate them. <code>$0</code> expands to the original unchanged input line.\n\nThere are alternate ways of writing this. This shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexport pattern=\"$1\"\nshift\nawk '$0 ~ ENVIRON[\"pattern\"] { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }' \"$@\"\n</source>\n\nThis is a shell script that uses <code>ENVIRON</code>, an array introduced in a newer version of the One True awk after the book was published. The subscript of <code>ENVIRON</code> is the name of an environment variable; its result is the variable's value. This is like the [[getenv]] function in various standard libraries and [[POSIX]]. The shell script makes an environment variable <code>pattern</code> containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file.\n\n<code>~</code> checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand; <code>!~</code> is its inverse. Note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables.\n\nThe next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\npattern=\"$1\"\nshift\nawk '$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }' \"pattern=$pattern\" \"$@\"\n</source>\n\nOr You can use the ''-v var=value'' command line option (e.g. ''awk -v pattern=\"$pattern\" ...'').\n\nFinally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nBEGIN {\n    pattern = ARGV[1]\n    for (i = 1; i < ARGC; i++) # remove first argument\n        ARGV[i] = ARGV[i + 1]\n    ARGC--\n    if (ARGC == 1) { # the pattern was the only thing, so force read from standard input (used by book)\n        ARGC = 2\n        ARGV[1] = \"-\"\n    }\n}\n$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }\n</source>\n\nThe <code>BEGIN</code> is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the <code>BEGIN</code> block ends. <code>ARGC</code>, the number of arguments, is always guaranteed to be \u22651, as <code>ARGV[0]</code> is the name of the command that executed the script, most often the string <code>\"awk\"</code>. Also note that <code>ARGV[ARGC]</code> is the empty string, <code>\"\"</code>. <code>#</code> initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line.\n\nNote the <code>if</code> block. awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command. This means that\n awk 'prog'\nonly works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before <code>prog</code> is run! If you explicitly set <code>ARGC</code> to 1 so that there are no arguments, awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files. Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename <code>-</code>.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 8}, {"title": " Hello World ", "paragraphs": "\nHere is the customary \"[[\"Hello, World!\" program|Hello, world]]\" program written in AWK:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nBEGIN { print \"Hello, world!\" }\n</source>\n\nNote that an explicit <code>exit</code> statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is <code>BEGIN</code>, no command-line arguments are processed.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": " Print lines longer than 80 characters ", "paragraphs": "\nPrint all lines longer than 80 characters.
