Agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses. Such agates, when cut [[transverse plane|transversely]], exhibit a succession of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, often of extreme [[wikt:tenuity|tenuity]], giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as ''banded agate'', ''riband agate'' and ''striped agate''.\n\nIn the formation of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing [[silica]] in solution\u2014derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself\u2014percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous gel in the interior of the [[Vesicular texture|vesicles]]. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of [[chalcedony]] often alternate with layers of crystalline [[quartz]]. Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is still [[Viscosity|viscous]], and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a [[Brazil]]ian [[geode]] lined with [[amethyst]] and weighing 35&nbsp;tons was exhibited at the [[D\u00fcsseldorf Exhibition]] of 1902. Perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by Moxon cited below.\n\nThe first deposit on the wall of a cavity, forming the \"skin\" of the agate, is generally a dark greenish mineral substance, like [[celadonite]], [[delessite]] or \"[[green earth]]\", which are rich in [[iron]] probably derived from the decomposition of the [[augite]] in the enclosing volcanic rock. This green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown [[iron oxide]] ([[limonite]]), producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate-nodule. The outer [[Surface science|surface]] of an agate, freed from its matrix, is often pitted and rough, apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating. The first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the \"priming\", and upon this base, [[Zeolite|zeolitic]] minerals may be deposited.\n\nMany agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of [[Druse (geology)|drusy quartz]], sometimes [[amethyst]]ine, having the [[Apex (geometry)|apices]] of the [[crystal]]s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity or geode.\n\nWhen the matrix in which the agates are embedded disintegrates, they are set free. The agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the [[soil]], or are deposited as [[gravel]] in streams and along shorelines.\n\nAgates can also be found in sedimentary rocks.  They need a cavity to form, so they are typically seen in limestone, [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], and shale which may have shells, tree branches, or roots in them that later decay away.  With the void created, silica-rich fluids can enter the cavity and precipitate [[chalcedony]] in curved bands forming agates.  Other quartz classes like amethyst or opal may then form the inner-most band inside the [[geode]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geology.com/articles/geodes/|title=Geodes: The rocks with a crystal surprise inside!|website=geology.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://geology.com/articles/geodes/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Geodes: The rocks with a crystal surprise inside!"}, {"name": "website", "value": "geology.com"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-05-15"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Types", "paragraphs": "\nA Mexican agate, showing only a single eye, has received the name of ''cyclops agate''. Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or [[moss agate]]. ''Dendritic'' agates include fern-like patterns formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetatable material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate, due to its appearance. [[Enhydro agate]] contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.\n\n''Turritella agate'' is formed from silicified [[fossil]] ''[[Elimia tenera]]'' (erroneously considered ''[[Turritella]]'') shells. ''E. tenera'' are spiral freshwater [[gastropod]]s with elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, [[coral]], [[petrified wood]] and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized.\n\n''Coldwater agates'', such as the Lake Michigan Cloud Agate, did not form under volcanic processes, but instead formed within the limestone and dolomite strata of marine origin. Like volcanic-origin agates, Coldwater Agates formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock. These agates are typically less colorful, with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brays|first1=Karen|title=Customer Agate Finds|url=http://agatelady.com/photo-gallery-customer-agate-finds.html|website=Gitche Gumee Museum|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Greek agate'' is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in [[Sicily]], once a Greek colony, back to{{clarify|date=February 2019}} 400 BC. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads.\n\n''Brazilian agate'' is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.\n\nCertain stones, when examined in [[thin section]]s by transmitted light, show a [[diffraction]] spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed ''rainbow agates''. Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.\n\n''Lace agate'' is a variety that exhibits a [[lace]]-like pattern with forms such as eyes, swirls, bands or zigzags (if these{{clarify|date=February 2019}} predominate, it is called ''lattice agate''). ''Crazy lace agate'', found in Mexico, is often brightly colored with a complex pattern.
