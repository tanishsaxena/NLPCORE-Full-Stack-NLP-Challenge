She had three elder brothers, [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero Caesar]], [[Drusus Caesar]] and the future Emperor [[Caligula]], and two younger sisters, [[Julia Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla]]. Agrippina's two elder brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the Praetorian Prefect [[Lucius Aelius Sejanus]].\n\nShe was the namesake of her mother. Agrippina the Elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron, who was the second daughter and fourth child of [[Julia the Elder]] and the statesman [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]. The father of Julia the Elder was the Emperor [[Augustus]], and Julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]], who had close blood relations with [[Pompey the Great]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].\n\nGermanicus, Agrippina's father, was a very popular general and politician. His mother was [[Antonia Minor]] and his father was the general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. He was Antonia Minor's first child. Germanicus had two younger siblings; a sister, named [[Livilla (sister of Claudius)|Livilla]], and a brother, the future Emperor [[Claudius]]. Claudius was Agrippina's paternal uncle and third husband.\n\nAntonia Minor was a daughter to [[Octavia the Younger]] by her second marriage to triumvir [[Mark Antony]], and Octavia was the second eldest sister and full-blooded sister of Augustus. Germanicus' father, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus the Elder]], was the second son of the Empress [[Livia]] Drusilla by her first marriage to praetor [[Tiberius Nero]], and was the Emperor [[Tiberius]]'s younger brother and Augustus's stepson. In the year 9, Augustus ordered and forced Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, who happened to be Tiberius's nephew, as his son and heir. Germanicus was a favorite of his great-uncle Augustus, who hoped that Germanicus would succeed his uncle Tiberius, who was Augustus's own adopted son and heir. This in turn meant that Tiberius was also Agrippina's adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great-uncle.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Further", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Julio-Claudian family tree"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Birth and early life", "paragraphs": "Agrippina was born on 6 November in AD 15, or possibly 14, at Oppidum Ubiorum, a Roman outpost on the [[Rhine]] River located in present-day [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].<ref>Gaius Stern, \"Caligula's Three Sisters\" suggests that the sisters of Caligula were born at two-year intervals \u2013 Agrippina in 14, Drusilla in 16, and Livilla in 18, ''contra'' Suetonius \"the girls were born in three consecutive years.\"  Tac.

Domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child. On December 15, AD 37, in the early morning, in Antium, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor [[Nero]]. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied \"I don't think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people\".\n\nCaligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships. On June 10, AD 38, Drusilla died, possibly of a fever, rampant in Rome at the time.

She also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Lucius' second paternal aunt and Messalina's mother [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]].\n\nIn 49, Agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the [[Celts|Celtic]] King [[Caratacus]] bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor. In 50, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]. She was only the third Roman woman ([[Livia]] Drusilla and [[Antonia Minor]] received this title) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Antonia) to receive this title.\n\nAlso that year, Claudius had founded a Roman colony and called the colony ''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis'' or ''Agrippinensium'', today known as [[Cologne]], after Agrippina who was born there. This colony was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51, she was given a ''carpentum'' which she used. A carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests, such as the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, and sacred statues. That same year she appointed [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]] as the head of the [[Praetorian Guard]], replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, [[Rufrius Crispinus]].\n\nAncient sources claim that Agrippina successfully influenced Claudius into adopting her son and making him his successor. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather in 50. Lucius' name was changed to ''[[Nero]] Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus'' and he became Claudius's adopted son, heir and recognised successor. Agrippina and Claudius betrothed Nero to Octavia, and Agrippina arranged to have [[Seneca the Younger]] return from exile to tutor the future emperor. Claudius chose to adopt Nero because of his Julian and Claudian lineage.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XII.25</ref>\n\nAgrippina deprived Britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible. For instance, in 51, Agrippina ordered the execution of Britannicus' tutor Sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by Claudius' adoption of Nero and his choice of Nero as successor, instead of choosing his own son Britannicus.<ref>Some compare this to when Tiberius had chosen Caligula and the other grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]] \"without any approbation.\"  Why would there be any approbation?  Tiberius had few descendants and Gemellus was the youngest of all of them.  First Tiberius designated the older brothers of Caligula (his adopted son's sons) as his successors. Later he accused and imprisoned them.  All he had left was Caligula (by then over 20) and Gemellus (under 10).  There would be more approbation for overlooking Caligula in Gemellus' favor.</ref>\n\nNero and Octavia were married on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing him for the throne. His actions allegedly gave Agrippina a motive to eliminate Claudius. The ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 (a Sunday) with a plate of deadly [[mushroom]]s at a banquet, thus enabling [[Nero]] to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources, it is possible that Claudius died of natural causes; Claudius was 63 years old.<ref name = \"yyroia\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 10}, {"title": "Reign of Nero", "paragraphs": "\n===Power struggle between mother and son===\n[[File:Ner\u00f3n y Agripina.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Sculpture of Agrippina crowning her young son Nero (c. 54\u201359&nbsp;AD)]]\n[[File:Nero Palatino Inv618.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Marble bust of [[Nero]].
