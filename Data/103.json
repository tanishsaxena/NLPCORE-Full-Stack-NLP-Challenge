In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.<ref name=\"Sands2009\" />\n* [[Beja language|Beja]], sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic, is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a substantial degree of internal diversity.\n* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.\n* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see [[#Subgrouping|\u00a7 Subgrouping]] below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.\n* The extinct [[Meroitic language]] has been proposed ([[Bruce Trigger]], 1964,<ref name=Trigger01>Trigger, Bruce G., ''\u2018Meroitic and Eastern Sudanic: A Linguistic Relationship?\u2019'', Kush 12, 1964, 188\u2013194.</ref> 1977<ref name=Trigger02>Trigger, Bruce, G.,''\u2018The Classification of Meroitic: Geographical Considerations\u2019'', Schriften zur Geschichte und Kultur des Alten Orients 13, 1977, 421\u2013435.</ref>) as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification (Fritz Hintze, 1974,<ref name=Hintze01>Hintze, Fritz, ''\u2018Some Problems of Meroitic Philology\u2019'', Abdel Gadir Mahmoud Abdalla (ed.),  Studies of the Ancient Languages of the Sudan, Sudanese Studies 3, Khartoum University Press, Khartoum, 1974, 73\u201378.</ref> 1979<ref name=Hintze02>Hintze, Fritz ''\u2018Beitr\u00e4ge zur meroitische Grammatik.\u2019'' Meroitica 3, Berlin, 1979, 1\u2013214.</ref>).\n* The classification of [[Kujarg\u00e9 language|Kujarg\u00e9]] within Afroasiatic is not agreed upon.

In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter \"Ethiopic\").{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the same year, T.N.

This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike M\u00fcller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.<ref name = \"mer\">[[Merritt Ruhlen]], ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80\u20131</ref>\n[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.png|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]]\nIn 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.<ref name = \"mer\"/> Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\"<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797</ref> However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].\" Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.<ref name=\"Ruhlen109\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109</ref>\n\n[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.\" He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.<ref name=\"Ruhlen\"/> He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\n\nGreenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Bonnie|date=2009|title=Africa's linguistic diversity|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=3|issue=2|pages=559\u2013580|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00124.x}}</ref>.

However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:\n* [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as [[grammatical gender]], noun-adjective [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], three-way [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction, and [[vowel alternation]] as a means of derivation).\n* Apparently influenced by M\u00f6ller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336\u2013338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].\n* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000\u20132002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].\n* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic.
