However, the design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect coordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is coordinated to construct the design.\n\n===Design role===\nThe architect, once hired by a client, is responsible for creating a design concept that both meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. The architect must meet with, and question, the client in order to ascertain all the requirements (and nuances) of the planned project.\n\nOften the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning: entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking.

Selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which may occur later. The site and its environs, as well as the culture and history of the place, will also influence the design. The design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of [[mathematics and architecture]], new or current [[architectural theory]], or references to [[architectural history]].\n\nA key part of the design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. The control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as BIM ([[Building Information Modeling]]), CAD, and cloud-based technologies.\n\nAt all times in the design, the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations, introducing a further variable into the design.\n\nArchitects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.\n\n====Means of design====\n\nPreviously, architects employed drawings<ref name=\"MAD 225\"/> to illustrate and generate design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/639533/17-napkin-sketches-by-famous-architects |title=17 Napkin Sketches by Famous Architects |date=5 June 2015 |access-date=8 March 2019 |first=Karissa |last=Rosenfield |work=[[ArchDaily]] |issn=0719-8884}}</ref> computer technology has now become the industry standard.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html |title=Think Before You Build |first=Witold |last=Rybczynski |date=30 March 2011 |magazine=[[Slate.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614053149/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html |archive-date=14 June 2018 |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |agency=[[Graham Holdings Company]] |access-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, [[3D scanning]] technology and other media in design production. \nIncreasingly, computer software such as [[BIM]] is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building's design, construction and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States |work=National BIM Standard |access-date=17 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |archive-date=16 October 2014 |publisher=[[National Institute of Building Sciences]]}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental role===\nAs current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations which are continually tightening. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://passipedia.org/basics/what_is_a_passive_house|title=What is a Passive House? [  ]|website=passipedia.org}}</ref>\nHowever, the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense, such as making provision for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air conditioning, pollution, and waste management, use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future.\n\n===Construction role===\nAs the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.\n\nDepending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions).\n\nArchitects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]], facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect's access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.\n\nThe architect will typically review contractor [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in the design and to manage construction.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions.\n\n===Alternate practice and specializations===\nRecent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, healthcare, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as building code, [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], historic preservation(US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.\n\nMany architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], construction management, [[interior design]], city planning, or other related fields.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.academia.edu/2061334/Space_The_undefinable_space_of_architecture"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Space: The undefinable space of architecture"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Erdem"}, {"name": "last", "value": "\u00dcng\u00fcr"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161219053520/http://www.academia.edu/2061334/Space_The_undefinable_space_of_architecture"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "19 December 2016"}, {"name": "via", "value": "[[Academia.edu]]"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "12"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "8 March 2019"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.archdaily.com/639533/17-napkin-sketches-by-famous-architects"}, {"name": "title", "value": "17 Napkin Sketches by Famous Architects"}, {"name": "date", "value": "5 June 2015"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "8 March 2019"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Karissa"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Rosenfield"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[ArchDaily]]"}, {"name": "issn", "value": "0719-8884"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Think Before You Build"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Witold"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Rybczynski"}, {"name": "date", "value": "30 March 2011"}, {"name": "magazine", "value": "[[Slate.com]]"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180614053149/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "14 June 2018"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[The Slate Group]]"}, {"name": "agency", "value": "[[Graham Holdings Company]]"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "8 December 2015"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States"}, {"name": "work", "value": "National BIM Standard"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "17 October 2014"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "16 October 2014"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[National Institute of Building Sciences]]"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://passipedia.org/basics/what_is_a_passive_house"}, {"name": "title", "value": "What is a Passive House?

Techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.\n\nDepending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions).\n\nArchitects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]], facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect's access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.\n\nThe architect will typically review contractor [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in the design and to manage construction.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 7}, {"title": "Alternate practice and specializations", "paragraphs": "Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, healthcare, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods.

To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.\n\nEducational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.\n\nProfessionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]] or [[wikt:surveyor|surveyor]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main article", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Professional requirements for architects"}]}, {"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Architectural engineering#Architect"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2013"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2013"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": "Fees", "paragraphs": "Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee.

Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.\n\nOverall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms.
