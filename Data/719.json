The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/>\n\nSoon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, \"Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498\u20131763\" pp. 34\u201336</ref> and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.<ref>Kerr, Robert (1824)</ref> Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief \"[[Aguazil]]\" of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs.<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.\n[[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]]\nIn Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history|year=1990|isbn=978-81-7022-226-2|pages=220\u2013221}}</ref> The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or \"esfera\"), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route.... I am very sure that, if this Malacca trade is taken out of their hands, Cairo and Mecca will be completely lost.''\" (The Commentaries of the Great Afonso de Albuquerque)\n[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]]]]\nIn February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Ara\u00fajo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.<ref name=\"Bosworth2007\">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}</ref>\nAfonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\"/> building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as \"[[A Famosa]]\" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

[[Sultanate of Ternate|Sultan Abu Lais of Ternate]] heard of their stranding, and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, brought them to Ternate in 1512 where they were permitted to build a fort on the island, the ''{{Interlanguage link|Forte de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ternate|pt|vertical-align=sup}}'', built in 1522.\n\n====China expeditions, 1513====\nIn early 1513, [[Jorge \u00c1lvares]], sailing on a mission under Afonso's orders, was allowed to land in [[Lintin Island]], on the [[Pearl River Delta]] in southern China. Soon after, Afonso sent [[Rafael Perestrello]] to southern China, seeking trade relations with the [[Ming dynasty]]. In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] and [[Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tom\u00e9 was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).<ref>Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett.

During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.\n\nWhile at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, \"all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught\".<ref>Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years.

[[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought \"[[Prester John]]\" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lBh--X3QjnsC&pg=PA1|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=1}}</ref> The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.\n\nIn February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris.

After half a day of fierce battle Afonso was forced to retreat. He cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], with the first European fleet to have sailed this route. He attempted to reach [[Jeddah]], but the winds were unfavourable and so he sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island in May, until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced him to retreat. In August 1513, after a second attempt to reach Aden, he returned to India with no substantial results. In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], he wrote to King Manuel of the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile]] river to render the whole country barren.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Perhaps most tellingly, he intended to steal the body of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], and hold it for ransom until all Muslims had left the [[Holy Land]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew James McGregor|title=A Military History of Modern Egypt: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War|year=2006|publisher=Praeger Publishers|isbn=978-0-275-98601-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/militaryhistoryo00andr/page/20 20]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/militaryhistoryo00andr/page/20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=The Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque, Second Viceroy of India|year=1999|publisher=Elibron Classics|isbn=978-1-4021-9508-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Albuquerque's expedition failed to reach Suez, such an incursion into the Red Sea by a Christian fleet for the first time in history stunned the Muslim world, and panic spread in Cairo.<ref>Roger Crowley (2016): ''Conquerors: How Portugal Seized the Indian Ocean and Forges the First Global Empire''] p.335</ref>\n\n===Submission of Calicut===\n[[File:Portuguese fort at Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|The Portuguese fort at Calicut]]\nAlbuquerque achieved during his term a favourable end to hostilities between the Portuguese and the Zamorin of Calicut, which had lasted ever since the massacre of the Portuguese in Calicut in 1502. As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.<ref>Elaine Sanceau (1936).

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except \"[[Sati (practice)|sati]]\", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).\n\nIn March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.\n\nIn early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]]. The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including an [[Indian rhinoceros]].<ref>Bedini, p. 112</ref> Afonso sent the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel.<ref name=\"lambe\">[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html Hist\u00f3ria do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht D\u00fcrer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155010/http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html |date=18 February 2009 }}, Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{in lang|pt}}.</ref> In late 1515, Manuel sent it as a gift, the famous [[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros]] to Pope Leo X.

The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.\n\nAt the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus \"freeing\" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622.<ref name=\"intlhistory.blogspot.com.au\">\" target=\"_blank\"http://intlhistory.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/alfonso-de-albuquerque-history-figure.html</ref> At Ormuz, Afonso met with Miguel Ferreira, returning with rich presents and an ambassador, carrying a letter from the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Holland Rose |author2=Ernest Alfred Benians |author3=Arthur Percival Newton |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1928|publisher=CUP Archive|page=12}}</ref> There he remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts, receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress, while becoming increasingly ill.

At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.<ref name=\"Albuquerque\">Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s de (1774).

Realizing the plot that his enemies had moved against him, profoundly disillusioned, he voiced his bitterness: \"Grave must be my sins before the King, for I am in ill favor with the King for love of the men, and with the men for love of the King.\"<ref>Gaspar Correia (1860) ''Lendas da \u00cdndia'', volume II, p 458</ref>\n\nFeeling himself near death, he donned the surcoat of the [[Military Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]], of which he was a knight, and drew up his will, appointed the captain and senior officials of Ormuz, and organized a final council with his captains to decide the main matters affecting the Portuguese State of India.<ref name=\"Early\"/>\n\nHe wrote a brief letter to King Manuel, asking him to confer onto his [[natural son]] \"all of the high honors and rewards\" that were justly due to Afonso.

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Early\"/><ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Ricardo Bonalume"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Neto"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Lightning rod of Portuguese India"}, {"name": "work", "value": "MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Cowles Enthusiast Media Spring"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1 April 2002"}, {"name": "page", "value": "68"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "Barbara Watson Andaya"}, {"name": "author2", "value": "Leonard Y.

The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/>\n\nSoon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, \"Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498\u20131763\" pp. 34\u201336</ref> and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.<ref>Kerr, Robert (1824)</ref> Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route....

It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.<ref name=\"Bosworth2007\">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}</ref>\nAfonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\"/> building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as \"[[A Famosa]]\" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women.

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Early\"/><ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Robert"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Rinehart"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Portugal: Chapter 2B.
