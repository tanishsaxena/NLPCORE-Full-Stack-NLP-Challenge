Flown in [[low Earth orbit]], it was the second crewed Apollo mission that the United States launched via a [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first flight of the full Apollo spacecraft: the [[command and service module]] (CSM) with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM). The mission was flown to [[flight qualify|qualify]] the LM for lunar orbit operations in preparation for the first Moon landing by demonstrating its [[descent propulsion system|descent]] and [[ascent propulsion system]]s, showing that its crew could fly it independently, then [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the CSM again, as would be required for [[Apollo 11|the first crewed lunar landing]]. Other objectives of the flight included firing the LM descent engine to propel the spacecraft stack as a backup mode (as would be required on the [[Apollo 13]] mission), and use of the [[Portable Life Support System]] backpack outside of the LM cabin.\n\nThe three-person crew consisted of Commander [[James McDivitt]], Command Module Pilot [[David Scott]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Rusty Schweickart]]. During the ten-day mission, they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems and docking maneuvers.\n\nAfter launching on March 3, 1969, the crew performed the first crewed flight of a lunar module, the first docking and extraction of the same, one two-person [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] (EVA), and the second docking of two crewed [[spacecraft]]\u2014two months after the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] performed a spacewalk crew transfer between {{nowrap|[[Soyuz 4]]}} and {{nowrap|[[Soyuz 5]]}}. The mission concluded on March 13 and was a complete success. It proved the LM worthy of crewed spaceflight, setting the stage for the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, [[Apollo 10]], before the ultimate goal, landing on the Moon.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "for", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the single by Adam Ant"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Vive Le Rock"}]}, {"name": "pp-move-indef", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3rd crewed mission of the Apollo space program"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2019"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2014"}]}, {"name": "Infobox spaceflight\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Apollo 9"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Gumdrop Meets Spider - GPN-2000-001100.jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "David Scott performs a stand-up EVA from Command Module ''Gumdrop'', seen from docked [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module ''Spider'']]"}, {"name": "insignia", "value": "Apollo-9-patch.png"}, {"name": "insignia_alt", "value": "Apollo 9 insignia"}, {"name": "mission_type", "value": "Crewed Earth orbital CSM/LM flight ([[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|D]])"}, {"name": "operator", "value": "[[NASA]]"}, {"name": "COSPAR_ID", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |CSM: 1969-018A{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|p=227}}\n  |LM ascent stage: 1969-018C{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|p=227}}\n  |LM descent stage: 1969-018D{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|p=227}}\n}}"}, {"name": "SATCAT", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |CSM: 3769\n  |LM: 3771\n}}"}, {"name": "mission_duration", "value": "10{{nbsp}}days, 1{{nbsp}}hour, 54{{nbsp}}seconds<ref name = \"nasa nine\" />"}, {"name": "orbits_completed", "value": "151{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|p=230}}"}, {"name": "spacecraft", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |[[Command and service module|Apollo CSM]]-104\n  |[[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo LM]]-3\n}}"}, {"name": "manufacturer", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |CSM: [[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]]\n  |LM: [[Grumman]]\n}}"}, {"name": "launch_mass", "value": "{{convert|95231|lb|kg}}<ref name=\"nasadatabook\">[[#Ezell|Ezell 1988]], Table 2-37: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol3/table2.37.htm \"Apollo 9 Characteristics\"].</ref>"}, {"name": "landing_mass", "value": "{{convert|11094|lb|kg}}"}, {"name": "launch_date", "value": "{{start-date|March 3, 1969, 16:00:00|timezone=yes}}{{nbsp}}UTC"}, {"name": "launch_rocket", "value": "[[Saturn V]] SA-504"}, {"name": "launch_site", "value": "[[Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy]] [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39A]]"}, {"name": "landing_date", "value": "{{end-date|March 13, 1969, 17:00:54|timezone=yes}}{{nbsp}}UTC"}, {"name": "landing_site", "value": "North Atlantic Ocean<br />{{coord|23|15|N|67|56|W|type:event|name=Apollo 9 splashdown}}"}, {"name": "recovery_by", "value": "{{USS|Guadalcanal|LPH-7|6}}"}, {"name": "decay_date", "value": "{{nowrap|October 23, 1981 (LM ascent stage)}}"}, {"name": "orbit_epoch", "value": "March 5, 1969<ref name=satcat>{{cite web|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|title=SATCAT|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|publisher=Jonathan's Space Pages|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>"}, {"name": "orbit_reference", "value": "[[geocentric orbit|Geocentric]]"}, {"name": "orbit_regime", "value": "[[Low Earth orbit]]"}, {"name": "orbit_periapsis", "value": "{{convert|204|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}}"}, {"name": "orbit_apoapsis", "value": "{{convert|497|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}}"}, {"name": "orbit_inclination", "value": "33.8{{nbsp}}degrees"}, {"name": "orbit_period", "value": "91.55{{nbsp}}minutes"}, {"name": "apsis", "value": "gee"}, {"name": "crew_size", "value": "3"}, {"name": "crew_members", "value": "{{Unbulleted list\n  |[[James McDivitt|James A.

Their training even started on the day before the Apollo{{nbsp}}1 fire, in the very first Block II spacecraft in which they were originally intended to fly. They took part in the vehicle checkouts for the CSM at [[North American Rockwell]]'s facility in [[Downey, California]] and for the LM at [[Grumman]]'s plant in [[Bethpage, New York]]. They also participated in testing of the modules at the launch site.{{sfn|Press Kit|p=83}}\n\nAmong the types of the training which the crew underwent were simulations of zero-G, both underwater and in the [[Vomit Comet]]. During these exercises, they practiced for the planned extravehicular activities (EVAs). They traveled to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for training on the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] (AGC) at [[MIT]]. The crew studied the sky at the [[Morehead Planetarium]] and at the [[Griffith Planetarium]], especially focusing on the 37 stars used by the AGC. They each spent more than 300 hours in the CM and LM simulators at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) and at Houston, some involving live participation by Mission Control.

The LM arrived from Grumman in June 1968 and was subjected to extensive testing including in the altitude chamber, simulating space conditions. As this occurred, other technicians assembled the Saturn{{nbsp}}V inside the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]]. The CM and SM arrived in October, but even the experienced KSC team from North American had trouble joining them together. When the lander was done with the altitude chamber, the CSM took its place, letting the LM be available for installation of equipment such as rendezvous radar and antennas. There were no lengthy delays, and on January 3, 1969, the launch vehicle was taken out of the VAB and moved to [[Launch Complex 39]]A by crawler.

If it was not possible to make such a docking, the lunar landing could not take place. It was Scott's responsibility to fly the CSM, which he did to a successful docking, as the probe and drogue docking assembly worked properly. After McDivitt and Schweickart inspected the tunnel connecting the CM and LM, the assembled spacecraft separated from the S-IVB.

The experience would teach the doctors enough about the sickness to have the astronauts avoid it on the lunar landings, but at the time Schweickart feared his vomiting might endanger Kennedy's goal. They were well enough to continue with the day's plan, and entered the LM, thus transferring between vehicles for the first time in the US space program, and making the first ever transfer without needing to spacewalk, as Soviet cosmonauts had. The hatches were then closed, though the modules remained docked, showing that ''Spider'''s communications and life support systems would work in isolation from those of ''Gumdrop''.

If it was not possible to make such a docking, the lunar landing could not take place. It was Scott's responsibility to fly the CSM, which he did to a successful docking, as the probe and drogue docking assembly worked properly. After McDivitt and Schweickart inspected the tunnel connecting the CM and LM, the assembled spacecraft separated from the S-IVB. The next task was to demonstrate that two docked spacecraft could be maneuvered by one engine. The five-second burn took place at 05:59.01.1 into the mission, accomplished with the SM's [[Service Propulsion System]] (SPS), after which Scott excitedly reported the LM was still in place.

The experience would teach the doctors enough about the sickness to have the astronauts avoid it on the lunar landings, but at the time Schweickart feared his vomiting might endanger Kennedy's goal. They were well enough to continue with the day's plan, and entered the LM, thus transferring between vehicles for the first time in the US space program, and making the first ever transfer without needing to spacewalk, as Soviet cosmonauts had.

At that moment, Aldrin knew Apollo{{nbsp}}10 would also succeed, and that he and [[Neil Armstrong|Armstrong]] would attempt to land on the Moon. On March 24, NASA made it official.\"{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=140, 144\u2013145}}\n\n[[File:AS09-23-3500 (22038477212).jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Moon in partial phase|Image of the Moon taken from Apollo{{nbsp}}9]]\nAlthough he might have been offered command of an Apollo lunar landing mission, McDivitt chose to leave the Astronaut Corps after Apollo{{nbsp}}9, becoming manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program later in 1969. Scott was soon given another spaceflight assignment as backup commander of Apollo 12, and then was made mission commander of [[Apollo 15]], landing on the Moon in 1971. Schweickart volunteered for medical investigation of his spacesickness, but was unable to shake its stigma, and was never again assigned to a prime crew. He took a leave of absence from NASA in 1977 that eventually became permanent.{{sfn|French & Burgess|pp=354\u2013362}} [[Eugene Cernan]], commander of [[Apollo 17]], stated that when it came to understanding spacesickness, Schweickart \"paid the price for them all\".{{sfn|French & Burgess|p=357}}\n\nIn the giddiness following the success of Apollo 9, NASA did not conduct the \"E mission\" (further testing in medium Earth orbit), and even considered skipping the \"F mission\", the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, going straight to the landing attempt. As the spacecraft designated for the first landing attempt were still being assembled, this was not done.{{sfn|French & Burgess|p=354}} NASA officials also felt that given the past difficulties with the LM, there was a need for a further test flight before the actual landing attempt, and that orbiting the Moon would give them the opportunity to study [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] there, which had affected Apollo{{nbsp}}8's orbit.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-22a|p=278}} According to French and Burgess in their study of the Apollo Program, \"In any event,{{nbsp}}...
