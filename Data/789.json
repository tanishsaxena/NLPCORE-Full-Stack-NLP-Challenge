On  7 January 1325, Afonso's father died and he, Afonso IV, became king, whereupon he exiled his rival, Afonso Sanches, to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], and stripped him of all the lands and [[fiefdom]] given by their father, Denis. From Castile, Afonso Sanches orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown.

Two years later, he had the marriage annulled so he could marry Afonso's daughter, Maria of Portugal. Maria became Queen of Castile in 1328 upon her marriage to Alfonso XI, who soon became involved publicly with a mistress.<ref name=Adam/> Constanza was imprisoned in a castle in Toro while her father, [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]], waged war against Alfonso XI until 1329. Eventually, the two reached a peaceful accord after mediation by Juan del Campo, Bishop of Oviedo; this secured Constance's release from prison.\n\nThe public humiliation of his daughter led Afonso IV to have his son and heir, [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter]], marry the no less aggrieved Castilian infanta, Constanza. Afonso subsequently started a war against Castile,<ref name=Adam/> peace arriving four years later, through the intervention of the Infanta Maria herself. A year after the peace treaty was signed in [[Seville]], Portuguese troops played an important role in defeating the [[Moors]] at the [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado]] in October 1340.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": " Later life ", "paragraphs": "[[Image:In\u00e8s de Castro se jetant avec ses enfants aux pieds d'Alphonse IV roi.jpg|left|300px|thumb|In\u00eas on her knees in front of King Afonso]]\nPolitical intrigue marked the last part of Afonso IV's reign, although Castille was torn by civil war after Alfonso XI died. [[Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]] challenged the new King [[Peter of Castile]], who sent many Castilian nobles into exile in Portugal. Afonso's heir, [[Peter I of Portugal|Pedro]], fell in love with his new wife's lady-in-waiting, [[In\u00eas de Castro]]. In\u00eas was the daughter of an important noble family from [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], with links (albeit illegitimate) to both the royal houses of Castile and Portugal. Her brothers were aligned with the Trastamara faction, and became favorites of crown prince Pedro, much to the dismay of others at the Portuguese court, who considered them Castilian upstarts. When [[Constance of Pe\u00f1afiel]] died weeks after giving birth to their third child, Pedro began living openly with In\u00eas, recognized all her children as his and repudiated the idea of marrying anyone other than In\u00eas herself. His father refused to go to war again against Castile, hoping his heir's infatuation would end, and tried to arrange another dynastic marriage for Pedro.\n\nThe situation became worse as the years passed and the aging Afonso lost control over his court. His grandson and Pedro's only legitimate son, future king [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando of Portugal]], was a sickly child, while In\u00eas' illegitimate children thrived. Worried about his legitimate grandson's life, and the growing power of Castile within Portugal's borders, Afonso ordered In\u00eas de Castro first imprisoned in his mother's old convent in [[Coimbra]], and then murdered in 1355. He expected his son to give in and marry a princess, but the heir became enraged upon learning of his lover's decapitation in front of their young children. Pedro put himself at the head of an army and devastated the country between the [[Douro]] and the [[Minho River|Minho]] rivers before he was reconciled to his father in early 1357.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso IV.|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)|volume=1|page=733}}</ref> Afonso died almost immediately after, in Lisbon in May.\n\nAfonso IV's nickname ''the Brave'' alludes to his martial exploits. However, his most important accomplishments were the relative peace enjoyed by the country during his long reign and the support he gave to the [[Portuguese Navy]]. Afonso granted public funding to raise a proper commercial fleet and ordered the first Portuguese maritime explorations. The conflict with Pedro, and the explorations he initiated, eventually became the foundation of the Portuguese national epic, ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas]]'' by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]].\n\nThe dramatic circumstances of the relationship between father and son and In\u00eas de Castro was used as the basis for the plot of more than twenty operas and ballets. The story with its tragic denouement is immortalized in several plays and poems in Portuguese, such as ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas|The Lus\u00edadas]]'' by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]] (canto iii, stanzas 118-135), and in Spanish, including ''Nise lastimosa'' and ''Nise laureada'' (1577) by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Berm\u00fadez]], ''Reinar despues de morir'' by [[Lu\u00eds V\u00e9lez de Guevara]], as well as a play by French playwright [[Henry de Montherlant]] called ''La Reine morte'' (''The Dead Queen''). [[Mary Russell Mitford]] also wrote a drama based on the story entitled ''Inez de Castro''. ''In\u00eas de Castro'' is a novel by [[Maria Pilar Queralt del Hierro]] in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "1"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Alphonso"}, {"name": "display", "value": "Alphonso s.v.
