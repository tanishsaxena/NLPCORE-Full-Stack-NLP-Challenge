In c. 350 BC, Alexander was brought to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]] in order to protect him. In 342/3 in his late 20s, Philip made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle Arybbas.<ref name=\"Ellis\"/>\n\nWhen Olympias was repudiated by her husband in 337 BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip. Alexander, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Philip by agreeing to marry the daughter of Philip (Alexander's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]]. During the wedding in 336 BC, Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]].\n\nIn 334&nbsp;BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], including the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]].
