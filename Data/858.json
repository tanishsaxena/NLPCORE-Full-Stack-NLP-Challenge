According to him, any object that held light was made of fire, and fire was made from the rarefaction of air.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nWhile other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the qualitative change in hot/dry and cold/wet pairings with the density of a single material, effectively adding a quantitative dimension to the Milesian [[Material monism|monistic system]].<ref name=\"guthrie1242\">Guthrie, W.K.C. \"The Milesians: Anaximenes.\" ''A History of Greek Philosophy''.

Although in modern times it is known that this is actually the opposite, Anaximenes was key in arriving at this conclusion. His analogies often connected parallels between man and the cosmos, insinuating that the same natural laws observable on earth applied to the heavens.<ref name=\":23\" /> Over 2000 years later, [[Isaac Newton]] proved this to be true.<ref name=\":23\" /> Throughout history, Anaximenes's observations proved helpful to uncover powerful theories, such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]].<ref name=\":23\" /> By the end of the Milesian philosophy era, there were many questions left unanswered; this sparked the stimulation of Pre-socratic thought to continue through many other notable philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Democritus]].<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nAnaximenes greatest influence is not from his theories of matter, but instead it is from how he thought about these ideas.

In the time of Anaximenes, phenomena were usually explained with reference to religion and mythology.

Felting is a technological model used to explain condensation, in which wool turns into felt and has new properties.<ref name=\":4\" /> Just as how wind is compressed into clouds in Anaximenes's theory. Without recognizing Anaximenes's influence on Plato, and simply focusing on Anaximenes's influence on Aristotle, Anaximenes's contributions to scientific thought are not fully recognized.
