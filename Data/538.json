Parsons was an audio engineer and producer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. A songwriter by profession, Woolfson was also a composer, a pianist, and a singer.

If the film industry was becoming a director's medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer's medium.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nRecalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons's respective talents. Parsons would produce and engineer songs written and composed by the two, and the first Alan Parsons Project was begun. The Project's first album, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976), which was released by [[20th Century Fox Records]] and included major contributions by all members of [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]] and [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], was a success, reaching the [[Top 40]] in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song \"[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]\" featured lead vocals by the actor [[Leonard Whiting]]. The 2007 remastered album liner notes, was the first rock song to use a [[Digital data|digital]] [[vocoder]], with Alan Parsons speaking [[lyrics]] through it, though others such as [[Bruce Haack]] had pioneered this field in the previous decade.\n\n=== 1977\u20131990: Mainstream success and final releases ===\n\n[[Arista Records]] then signed the Alan Parsons Project participants for further albums. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Project's popularity continued to grow. (However, the Project was always more popular in North America, Ibero-America, and [[Continental Europe]] than in Parsons's home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album). The [[single (music)|singles]] \"[[I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You]]\", \"[[Games People Play (Alan Parsons Project song)|Games People Play]]\", \"Damned If I Do\", \"Time\" (the first single to feature Woolfson's lead vocal) and \"[[Eye in the Sky (song)|Eye in the Sky]]\" had a notable impact on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"[[Don't Answer Me]]\" became the Project's last successful single in the United States; it reached the top 15 on the American charts in 1984. After those successes, however, the Project began to fade from view. There were fewer hit singles, and declining album sales. 1987's ''[[Gaudi (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Gaudi]]'' would be the Project's final release, though it had planned to record an album called ''[[Freudiana]]'' (1990) next.\n\n==== The musical ''Freudiana'' ====\nEven though the studio version of ''Freudiana'' was produced by Parsons (and featured the regular Project backing musicians, making it an 'unofficial' Project album), it was primarily Woolfson's idea to turn it into a musical. This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music. ''[[Freudiana]]'', ''Gaudi'', and ''Gambler'' were three musicals that included some Project songs like \"Eye in the Sky\", \"Time\", \"Inside Looking Out\", and \"Limelight\". The live music from ''Gambler'' was only distributed at the performance site in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], Germany.\n\n==== ''The Sicilian Defence'' ====\nIn 1979, Parsons, Woolfson, and their [[record label]] Arista, had been stalled in contract renegotiations when the two submitted an all-instrumental album tentatively titled ''[[The Sicilian Defence (The Alan Parsons Project)|The Sicilian Defence]]'', named after an [[Sicilian Defence|aggressive opening move]] in chess, arguably to get out of their [[recording contract]]. Arista's refusal to release the album had two known effects: the negotiations led to a renewed contract, and the album was not released at that time.\n\n{{quote|''The Sicilian Defence'' was our attempt at quickly fulfilling our contractual obligation after ''I Robot'', ''Pyramid'', and ''Eve'' had been delivered. The album was rejected by Arista, not surprisingly, and we then renegotiated our deal for the future and the next album, ''The Turn of a Friendly Card''.

It was used as entrance music by various American sports teams, most notably by the [[Chicago Bulls]] during their 1990s [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]]. It was also used as the entrance theme for [[Ricky Steamboat]] in pro wrestling of the mid-1980s. In addition, \"Sirius\" has been played in a variety of TV shows and movies including the [[BBC]] series [[Record Breakers]], the episode \"Vanishing Act\" of ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' and the 2009 film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]''.\n\nLead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their style to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits, including \"Time\", \"Eye in the Sky\", and \"Don't Answer Me\". The record company pressured Parsons to use him more. However, Parsons preferred to use more technically polished and proficient singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not. In addition to Woolfson, vocalists [[Chris Rainbow]], [[Lenny Zakatek]], [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]], [[David Paton]], and [[Colin Blunstone]] made regular appearances.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Other singers, such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], Steve Harley, [[Gary Brooker]], [[Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera|Dave Terry a.k.a. Elmer Gantry]], [[Vitamin Z]]'s Geoff Barradale, and [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]]'s Dean Ford, have recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons himself only sang lead on one song (\"[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]\") through a [[vocoder]] and backing on a few others, including \"To One in Paradise\". Both of those songs appeared on ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976).\n\nA small number of musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly. These core musicians contributed to the recognisable style of a Project song in spite of the varied singer line-up. Together with Parsons and Woolfson, the Project originally consisted of the group [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]], with [[Ian Bairnson]] (guitar), [[David Paton]] (bass) and [[Stuart Tosh]] (drums).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Pilot's keyboardist [[Billy Lyall]] also contributed. From ''[[Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Pyramid]]'' (1978) onwards, Tosh was replaced by [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] of [[Cockney Rebel]]. Bairnson played on all albums, and Paton stayed almost until the end. [[Andrew Powell]] appeared as arranger of orchestra (and often choirs) on all albums except ''[[Vulture Culture]]'' (1985), when he was composing the [[film score|score]] of [[Richard Donner]]'s film ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985). This score was partly in the Project style, recorded by most of the Project regulars, and produced and engineered by Parsons. Powell also composed some material for the first two Project albums. From ''Vulture Culture'' onwards, Richard Cottle played as a regular member on synthesizers and saxophone.\n\n[[File:Alan Parsons live.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Alan Parsons Live Project, June 1998 (distinct from the Alan Parsons Project live)]]\nExcept for one occasion, the Project never played live during its original incarnation. This was because Woolfson and Parsons saw themselves mainly in the roles of writing and production, and also because of the technical difficulties of reproducing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio. In the 1990s things changed with the technology of [[digital sampler]]s. The one occasion where the band was introduced as 'The Alan Parsons Project' in a live performance was at [[Night of the Proms]] in October 1990 (at the time of the group's break-up), featuring all Project regulars except Woolfson, who was present but behind the scenes, while Parsons stayed at the mixer except during the last song, where he played acoustic guitar.\n\nSince 1993, a new version of the band has toured, with Parsons performing live acoustic guitar, keyboards and vocals, with various line-ups. This latest incarnation was called '''Alan Parsons''', later renamed the '''Alan Parsons Live Project''' to be distinct from 'The Alan Parsons Project', due to founder Parsons' break-up with Woolfson. The band currently features lead singer [[P.J. Olsson]], guitarist [[Jeffrey Kollman]], drummer Danny Thompson, keyboardist [[Tom Brooks (music producer)|Tom Brooks]], bass guitarist [[Guy Erez]], vocalist and saxophonist Todd Cooper, and guitarist and vocalist Dan Tracey. In 2013, Alan Parsons Live Project played [[Colombia]] with a full choir and orchestra (the [[Medellin]] Philharmonic) as 'Alan Parsons Symphonic Project'. A 2-CD live set and a DVD version of this concert were released in May 2016.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Wilson"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Rich"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Alan Parsons Project: \"I think we were part of the punk rebellion\""}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://teamrock.com/feature/2015-11-25/alan-parsons-project-i-think-we-were-part-of-the-punk-rebellion"}, {"name": "website", "value": "[[Team Rock]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "14 December 2016"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.popmatters.com/176701-the-alan-parsons-project-i-robot-legacy-edition-2495706730.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Alan Parsons Project: I Robot (Legacy Edition)"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Houle"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Zachary"}, {"name": "date", "value": "3 December 2013"}, {"name": "website", "value": "[[PopMatters]]"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "12 January 2020"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Joe"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Stuessy"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Rock and Roll: Its History and Stylistic Development"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Prentice Hall]]"}, {"name": "page", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/rockrollitshisto00stue_0/page/380 380]"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-13-782426-2"}, {"name": "url-access", "value": "registration"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/rockrollitshisto00stue_0/page/380"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": " Members ", "paragraphs": ";Official members\n* [[Alan Parsons]] \u2013 production, [[Audio engineering|engineering]], programming, composition, keyboards, guitar (1975\u2013)\n* [[Eric Woolfson]] \u2013 composition, lyrics, piano, keyboards, vocals, [[Music executive|executive production]] (1975\u20131987, 1990)\n\n;Notable contributors\n* [[Andrew Powell]] \u2013 composition, keyboards, orchestral arrangements (1975-1996)<ref>[http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/otherapp01.html John Miles, Laurence Cottle, Ian Bairnson, Contributed to The Alan Parsons Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031025040/http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/otherapp01.html |date=31 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Philharmonia Orchestra]]\n* [[Ian Bairnson]] \u2013 guitar (1975\u20132002)\n* [[David Pack]] \u2013 guitar (1976, 1993, 2004), vocals & keyboards (1993, 2004)\n* [[Richard Cottle]] \u2013 keyboards, saxophone (1984\u20131985)\n* [[David Paton]] \u2013 bass, vocals (1975\u20131985)\n* [[Stuart Tosh]] \u2013 drums, percussion (1975\u20131978)\n* [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] \u2013 drums, percussion (1977\u20132002)\n* [[Geoff Barradale]] \u2013 vocals (1987)\n* [[Dennis Clarke]] - saxophone (1978)\n* [[Colin Blunstone]] \u2013 vocals (1978\u20131984)\n* [[Gary Brooker]] \u2013 vocals (1985)\n* [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] \u2013 vocals (1975)\n* [[Lesley Duncan]] \u2013 vocals (1979)\n* [[Graham Dye]] \u2013 vocals (1985, 1998)\n* [[Dean Ford]] \u2013 vocals (1978)\n* [[Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera|Dave Terry (\"Elmer Gantry\")]] \u2013 vocals (1980, 1982)\n* [[Jack Harris (musician)|Jack Harris]] \u2013 vocals (1976\u20131978)\n* [[The Hollies]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]] \u2013 vocals (1976, 1978, 1985, 1987)\n* [[Chris Rainbow]] \u2013 vocals (1979\u20132002)\n* [[Eric Stewart]] \u2013 vocals (1993, 1996)\n* [[Peter Straker]] \u2013 vocals (1977)\n* [[Clare Torry]] \u2013 vocals (1979)\n* [[Dave Townsend]] \u2013 vocals (1977, 1979)\n* [[Lenny Zakatek]] \u2013 vocals (1977\u20131987)\n* [[The English Chorale]] \u2013 choir (1976, 1977, 1982, 1987)\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "webarchive ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071031025040/http://www.the-alan-parsons-project.com/otherapp01.html"}, {"name": "date", "value": "31 October 2007"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": " Discography ", "paragraphs": "{{Main|The Alan Parsons Project discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n* ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[I Robot (album)|I Robot]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Pyramid]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Eve (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Eve]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[The Turn of a Friendly Card]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Eye in the Sky (album)|Eye in the Sky]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Ammonia Avenue]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Vulture Culture]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Stereotomy]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Gaudi (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Gaudi]]'' (1987)\n\n=== Compilations ===\n* ''[[The Best of The Alan Parsons Project (1983 album)|The Best of The Alan Parsons Project]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Best of The Alan Parsons Project, Vol. 2]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Instrumental Works]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[The Definitive Collection (Alan Parsons album)|The Definitive Collection]]'' (1997;
