Ibn Zallu sent his student [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] to preach Malikite Islam to the Sanhaja Berbers of the Sous and Adrar (present-day [[Mauritania]]). Hence, the name of the Almoravids comes from the followers of the Dar al-Murabitin, \"the house of those who were bound together in the cause of God.\"<ref>Messier, Ronald A. ''The Almoravids and the meanings of jihad'', Santa Barbara, CA. Praeger Publishers, 2010.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. [[al-Bakri]], writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the ''al-Murabitun'', but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, [[Ibn Abi Zar]] suggested it was chosen early on by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]<ref>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 81]].</ref> because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ''ribat'' (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly [[Tidra]] island, in the [[Bay of Arguin]]).<ref>Ibn Abi Zar's account is translated in N. Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds (2000), ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'', University of Ghana,pp. 239ff. For tentative identification of the ''ribat'', see Moraes Farias (1967).</ref> [[Ibn Idhari]] wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the \"persevering in the fight\" sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the [[Draa]] valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications.\n\nThe name might be related to the ''ribat'' of [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag ibn Zallu]] in the village of [[Tnine Aglou|Aglu]] (near present-day [[Tiznit]]), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer [[Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili]], and [[Qadi Ayyad]] before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called ''Dar al-Murabitin'' (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ibn al-Zayyat|title=\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0641|year=1220|page=89|authorlink=Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili|trans-title=Looking to know the men of Sufism}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Qadi Ayyad|title=\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643.|orig-year=12th century|pages=839\u201340|authorlink=Qadi Ayyad|trans-title=Biographies of Eminent Maliki Scholars}}</ref>\n\nContemporaries frequently referred to them as the ''al-mulathimun'' (\"the veiled ones\", from ''[[litham]]'', [[Arabic]] for \"veil\"). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a [[tagelmust]], a custom they adapted from southern [[Sanhaja]] Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern [[Tuareg people]], but it was unusual further north.) Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of \"foreignness\" in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids. Under their rule, [[sumptuary law]]s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding [[Almohads]] made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of [[effeminacy]] and decadence.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/almoravid"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Almoravid {{!}} Definition of Almoravid by Lexico"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2019-10-15"}]}, {"name": "Lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0627\u0637"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u0631\u0628\u0637"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ar"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Ibn al-Zayyat"}, {"name": "title", "value": "\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0641"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1220"}, {"name": "page", "value": "89"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili"}, {"name": "trans-title", "value": "Looking to know the men of Sufism"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Qadi Ayyad"}, {"name": "title", "value": "\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643."}, {"name": "orig-year", "value": "12th century"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "839\u201340"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Qadi Ayyad"}, {"name": "trans-title", "value": "Biographies of Eminent Maliki Scholars"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Origins", "paragraphs": "The Berbers of the [[Tamazgha]] in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the [[Zenata]] across the north, the [[Masmuda]] concentrated in central Morocco, and the Sanhaja, clustered in two areas: the western part of the [[Sahara]] and the hills of the eastern Maghreb.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u02bbAbd al-W\u0101\u1e25id Dhann\u016bn \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}})</ref><ref>Mones (1988), p. 119; (1992), p. 228.</ref> The eastern Sanhaja included the [[Kutama]] Berbers, who had been the base of the [[Fatimid]] rise in the early 10th century, and the [[Zirid dynasty]], who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western [[Sanhaja]] were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the [[Lamta]] in the [[Draa valley]] and the foothills of the [[Anti-Atlas]] range; further south, encamped in the western [[Sahara desert]], were the Massufa, the [[Lamtuna]] and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala (or Judala), in littoral [[Mauritania]] down to the borderlands of the [[Senegal River]].\n\nThe western Sanhaja had been converted to [[Islam]] some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched several campaigns against the \"[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese\" (pagan peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]).<ref>Lewicki (1988), pp. 160\u201361; (1992), pp. 308\u201309.</ref> Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of [[Awdaghust]], a critical stop on the [[trans-Saharan trade]] route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the [[Ghana empire]]; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the Zenata [[Maghrawa]] of [[Sijilmassa]]. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years.\n\nAround 1040, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. On his return, he stopped by [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]], where he met [[Abu Imran al-Fasi]], a native of [[Fes]] and a jurist and scholar of the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] ruler [[al-Muizz ibn Badis]], was openly contemplating breaking with his [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]] overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Within this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of [[Scharia|Islamic law]] among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the ''ribat'' of Waggag ibn Zelu in the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]].\n\nAbdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as \"son of [[Ya Sin]]\" (the title of the 36th [[Sura]] of the [[Qur'an]]), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was \"re-born\" of the Holy Book.<ref>M. Brett and E. Fentress (1996), ''The Berbers'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 100. Revealingly, the 36th Sura begins the salutation \"You are one of messengers\" and the imperative duty to set people \"on the straight path\". Ibn Yasin's choice of name was probably not a coincidence.</ref> Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]].<ref name=\"shilling88\" /> (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s.\n\nIbn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people.<ref name=\"shilling88\">{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-333-59957-0|page=88}}</ref> Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni]] invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as \"opposition\". He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin\u2014soon calling themselves the ''al-Murabitin'' (Almoravids)\u2014set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "\u02bbAbd al-W\u0101\u1e25id Dhann\u016bn \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Routledge"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-415-00474-8"}]}, {"name": "google books", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "TgcOAAAAQAAJ"}, {"name": "2", "value": "online"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Shillington"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Kevin"}, {"name": "title", "value": "History of Africa"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Palgrave Macmillan"}, {"name": "location", "value": "New York"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-333-59957-0"}, {"name": "page", "value": "88"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Conquests", "paragraphs": "{{Campaignbox Almoravid Empire battles}}\n\n===Northern Africa===\nFrom the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert.
