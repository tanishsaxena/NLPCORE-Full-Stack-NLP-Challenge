It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, [[fish pond]]s, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]]. Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are, in order, [[carp]], [[salmon]], [[tilapia]], and [[catfish]].<ref name=\"faostat\" />\n\nIn the Mediterranean, young [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore.

Southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow-out sea cages in southern [[Spencer Gulf]], [[South Australia]].\n\nA similar process is used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Farming the Sea|first=Frank|last=Asche|journal=Marine Resource Economics|volume=23|issue=4|year=2008|pages=527\u2013547 |jstor=42629678|doi=10.1086/mre.23.4.42629678}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Future Seascapes, Fishing, and Fish Farming|first=Rebecca |last=Goldburg |first2=Rosamond |last2=Naylor|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|date=February 2005|pages=21\u201328|doi=10.2307/3868441|jstor=3868441}}</ref> An additional method, known sometimes as sea ranching, has also been used within the industry.

Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about [[United States dollar|US$]]9 billion. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.\n\nShrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[nongovernmental organization]]s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices through the [[Seafood Watch]] program.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Seafood Watch|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium|access-date=2013-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511232001/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|archive-date=2013-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Freshwater prawn farm]]ing shares many characteristics with, including many problems with, marine shrimp farming.

For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth.

Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about [[United States dollar|US$]]9 billion. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.\n\nShrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[nongovernmental organization]]s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices through the [[Seafood Watch]] program.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Seafood Watch|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium|access-date=2013-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511232001/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|archive-date=2013-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Freshwater prawn farm]]ing shares many characteristics with, including many problems with, marine shrimp farming.

This results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish. Flushing times, current speeds, distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems.\n\nThe extent of the effects of pollution from sea-cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located, which species are kept, how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed.

Attempts to minimise stress can occur throughout the culture process. During grow out it is important to keep stocking densities at appropriate levels specific to each species, as well as separating size classes and grading to reduce aggressive behavioural interactions. Keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation.\n\nNot surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures. However, prevention methods, such as vaccination, can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection.<ref name=\"Ashley\" /> Other methods include adding antibiotics to feed, adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control, such as using [[cleaner fish|cleaner wrasse]] to remove lice from farmed salmon.<ref name=\"Ashley\" />\n\nMany steps are involved in transport, including capture, food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water, transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps, plus transport and transfer to the delivery location. During transport water needs to be maintained to a high quality, with regulated temperature, sufficient oxygen and minimal waste products.<ref name=\"Conte\" /><ref name=\"Ashley\" /> In some cases [[anaesthetics]] may be used in small doses to calm fish before transport.<ref name=\"Ashley\" />\n\nAquaculture is sometimes part of an environmental rehabilitation program or as an aid in conserving endangered species.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mZ0eOg8ld5QC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=aquaculture+and+rehabilitation+and+ex-situ&q=aquaculture%20and%20rehabilitation%20and%20ex-situ|title=Aquaculture Development|work=google.be|isbn=9789251039717|last1=Nations|first1=Food Agriculture Organization of the United|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "see also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pain in fish"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Pain in invertebrates"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "pmid", "value": "16358506"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "H\u00e5stein"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "T."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Science-based assessment of welfare: Aquatic animals"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Revue Scientifique et Technique (International Office of Epizootics)"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "24"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "529\u201347"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Scarfe"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "A.

This saves water and the waste gathered can be used in [[compost]] or, in some cases, could even be treated and used on land. While RAS was developed with freshwater fish in mind, scientist associated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have found a way to rear saltwater fish using RAS in low-salinity waters.<ref name=\"Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/feb09/seafood0209.htm\n|title=Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!\n|publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service\n|date=February 2009}}</ref> Although saltwater fish are raised in off-shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt), scientists were able to produce healthy pompano, a saltwater fish, in tanks with a salinity of only 5 ppt. Commercializing low-salinity RAS are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects. Unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm-raised fish would greatly be reduced. The price of expensive saltwater fish, such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments, would be reduced. However, before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish's lifecycle, including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water, what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle, the [[stocking rate]] that will produce the healthiest fish, etc.<ref name=\"Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!\"/>\n\nSome 16 countries now use [[geothermal energy]] for aquaculture, including China, [[Israel]], and the United States.<ref name=\"earth-policy\">[http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB2/pb2ch10.pdf \"Stabilizing Climate\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235731/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB2/pb2ch10.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} in Lester R.
