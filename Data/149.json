Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]].\n\nTarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956 Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the [[screenplay]] ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.\n\nAn important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigory Chukhray]], who was teaching at the VGIK. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhray offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''.

Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]].\n\nTarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors.

The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the [[screenplay]] ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.\n\nAn important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigory Chukhray]], who was teaching at the VGIK.

From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. In this film Tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the \"third category,\" a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.<ref>Marshall, Herbert.

T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.\n\nThe last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c ''Pervyj Dyen'''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors.

The inscription on his gravestone, which was conceived by Tarkovsky's wife, Larisa Tarkovskaya, reads: ''To the man who saw the Angel''.\n\nA conspiracy theory emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the [[KGB]]. Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1991 coup]] and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.<ref>Komsolmoskaya Pravda, \"New Tarkovsky documents surface\", 15.

''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities.

From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. In this film Tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the \"third category,\" a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.<ref>Marshall, Herbert.

T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.\n\nThe last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c ''Pervyj Dyen'''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]].

He said of Dovzhenko's ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]'': \"I have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people. They spread calmness, had such tact, they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that I have seldom come across on such a scale.

By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.\n\nUp to, and including, his film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.\n\nSeveral of Tarkovsky's films have color or black-and-white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Photographic print toning|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a \"commercial gimmick\" and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema \u2013 Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527083703/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |archive-date=27 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n; Bergman on Tarkovsky\n\n[[Ingmar Bergman]], a renowned director, commented on Tarkovsky:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nostalghia.com/ |title=An Andrei Tarkovsky Information Site |last=Bielawski |first=Trond Trondsen and Jan |website=nostalghia.com |access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|text=My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle.

During his career he directed seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at VGIK. His features are:\n* ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' (1986)\n\nHe also wrote several screenplays. Furthermore, he directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory.\n\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804052531/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |archive-date=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiaj\u0105 Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137\u2013160 |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html |access-date=16 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116155850/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html |archive-date=16 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Andrei Tarkovsky filmography"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Tarkovsky"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Andrei"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography)"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Iskusstvo Kino"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1990"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "14 January 2008"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080804052531/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "4 August 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Illg"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Jerzy"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiaj\u0105 Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Res Publica"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "137\u2013160"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1987"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "16 January 2008"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080116155850/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "16 January 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}], "id": 16}, {"title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": "\nBooks written by Tarkovsky\n#''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', published in 1986\n#''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970\u20131986|Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970'''''\u2013'''''1986]]'', published in 1989\n\nA book of 60 photos, ''Instant Light, Tarkovsky Polaroids'', taken by Tarkovsky in Russia and Italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006.
