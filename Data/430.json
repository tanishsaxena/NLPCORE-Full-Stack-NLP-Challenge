Light's design, now [[Australian National Heritage List|listed as national heritage]], set out the city centre in a [[grid plan|grid layout]], interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by [[Adelaide Parklands|parklands]].\n\nEarly colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. Until the [[post-war]] era, it was Australia's third-largest city. It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the \"City of Churches\" due to its diversity of faiths. Today, Adelaide is noted for [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its [[South Australian wine|food and wine]], its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. Adelaide's [[quality of life]] has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century.\n\nAs South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] along the cultural boulevards of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] and [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William

Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.\n[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|left|upright|1888 map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]\n[[George Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a [[Customs House Port Adelaide|customs house]] and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.\n\nTrade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the [[Murray River]] was successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament.

The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.\n[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|left|upright|1888 map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]\n[[George Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a [[Customs House Port Adelaide|customs house]] and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.\n\nTrade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the [[Murray River]] was successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament.

In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed.

His plan, sometimes referred to as \"Light's Vision\" (also the name of a statue of him on [[Montefiore Hill]]), arranged Adelaide in a [[Grid plan|grid]], with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.<ref>Page, M. (1981): ''Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851\u20131979.'' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17\u201320. {{ISBN|0-7270-1510-9}}</ref> Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to [[Ancient Greece]], including [[Italian Renaissance]] designs and the layouts of the American cities [[Philadelphia]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Adelaide|first=Kerryn|last=Goldsworthy|year=2011|publisher=NewSouth|isbn=9-7817-4224092-3|pp=83}}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306220115/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=6 March 2014 }}, 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.</ref>\n\n[[File:Adelaide nth tce1.8.jpg|thumb|left|The corner of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] (right) and [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] (left), looking south-west from [[Bonython Hall]].]]\n\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and \"country towns\", as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].\n\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth.

The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 \"Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village\"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.<ref>Gibbs, R.M.

After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated (iron) steel or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and Colorbond(R) corrugated (and other types of) steel have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of \"double brick\" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by \"dwarf walls\".

In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&nbsp;mm. [[Frosts]] are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city with significant [[wind chill]] in winter, which makes the temperature [[apparent temperature|seem colder than it actually is]]. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon, although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at [[Mount Lofty]] occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from {{convert|8|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.

Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, sometimes referred to as \"Light's Vision\" (also the name of a statue of him on [[Montefiore Hill]]), arranged Adelaide in a [[Grid plan|grid]], with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.<ref>Page, M. (1981): ''Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851\u20131979.'' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17\u201320. {{ISBN|0-7270-1510-9}}</ref> Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to [[Ancient Greece]], including [[Italian Renaissance]] designs and the layouts of the American cities [[Philadelphia]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Adelaide|first=Kerryn|last=Goldsworthy|year=2011|publisher=NewSouth|isbn=9-7817-4224092-3|pp=83}}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306220115/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=6 March 2014 }}, 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.</ref>\n\n[[File:Adelaide nth tce1.8.jpg|thumb|left|The corner of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] (right) and [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] (left), looking south-west from [[Bonython Hall]].]]\n\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and \"country towns\", as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].\n\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways \u2013 A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Co1srti?url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm |archive-date=25 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.\n\n[[File:Transformers - Victoria Square Adelaide SA - panoramio.jpg|thumb|270px|Aerial view of [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]], one of the four main squares in the city centre and considered the heart of Adelaide's [[Grid plan|grid layout]].]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 \"Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village\"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838<ref>Monteath, P., Paul, M., & Martin, R.

The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] was established in 1960 under Thomas Playford, which in the same year spawned an unofficial uncurated series of performances and exhibits which grew into the [[Adelaide Fringe]]. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] in 1972 and the [[State Opera of South Australia]] in 1976.\n\nOver time, the Adelaide Festival expanded to include [[Adelaide Writers' Week]] and [[WOMADelaide]], and other separate festivals were established, such as the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] (2002), the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]] (1999), the [[Adelaide Film Festival]] (2013), [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (1999, a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]]) and [[Tasting Australia]] (1997, a food and wine affair). With the Festival, the Fringe, WOMADelaide, Writers' Week and the [[Adelaide 500]] street motor racing event (along with evening music concerts) all happening in early March, the period has become known colloquially as \"Mad March\".\n\n[[File:ACC - NYE low res-69.jpg|thumb|NYE celebrations in 2016 in [[Elder Park]] on the River Torrens, with Adelaide Oval and Adelaide Festival Centre also in view.]]\n\nIn 2014, [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] founded the [[Adelaide Language Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/alf/|title=Adelaide Language Festival 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310023446/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/alf/|archive-date=2015-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lcnau2017.org/adelaide-languages-festival|title=Adelaide Language Festival, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142218/https://www.lcnau2017.org/adelaide-languages-festival|archive-date=9 September 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere are many international cultural fairs, most notably the German [[Sch\u00fctzenfest]] and Greek [[Glendi]].

However, such arterial roads often experience traffic congestion as the city grows.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Malcontent \u2013 The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\\document_677.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115022910/http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents%5Cdocument_677.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df=dmy }} (1.18MB)</ref>\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:\n* The [[South Eastern Freeway]] (M1), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]] and [[Tailem Bend]], where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.\n* The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] (M2), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of [[South Road]].\n* The [[North-South Motorway]] (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north-south corridor, replacing most of what is now [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], connecting the [[Southern Expressway (Adelaide)|Southern Expressway]] and the [[Northern Expressway]] via an expressway with no traffic lights. Currently, the motorway runs as an elevated freeway from its junction with the Port River Expressway to Regency Road, in Adelaide's inner north-west. Continuation of the motorway is currently under construction in form of the [[Northern Connector]] project, the Darlington Upgrade project and the [[Torrens Road]] to [[River Torrens]] project.\n* The [[Port River Expressway]] (A9), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern \"entrance\" to the metropolitan area.\n* The [[Northern Expressway]] (Max Fatchen Expressway) (M20), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler Bypass]] to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.\n* The [[Northern Connector]] (proposed route M20) commenced construction in 2016, to connect the North-South Motorway with the Northern Expressway. The road will not be subject to direct tolls, but South Australia will become a testing ground for a \"network fee\" that involves charging trucks based on road use and impact in place of high registration fees.\n\n==== Airports ====\n[[File:Adelaide Airport, 2008.jpg|thumb|A [[Qantas]] plane leaving [[Adelaide Airport]].]]\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, [[Adelaide Airport|Adelaide International Airport]] and [[Parafield Airport]].
