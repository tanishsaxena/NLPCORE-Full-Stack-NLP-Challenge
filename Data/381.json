He invented the first [[perfusion pump]] with [[Charles A. Lindbergh]] opening the way to [[organ transplantation]].

In 1903 he emigrated to Montreal, Canada, but soon relocated to Chicago, Illinois, to work for Hull Laboratory. While there he collaborated with American physician [[Charles Claude Guthrie]] in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the [[head transplant|head]], and Carrel was awarded the 1912 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for these efforts.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1912/index.html Nobelprize.org]</ref>\n\nIn 1906 he joined the newly formed [[Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research]] in New York where he spent the rest of his career.<ref name=\"Reggiani\">Reggiani{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2019}}<!--is this the book God's Eugenicist or the 2002 journal article--> </ref> There he did significant work on tissue cultures with pathologist [[Montrose Thomas Burrows]]. In the 1930s, Carrel and [[Charles Lindbergh]] became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal, political, and social views. Lindbergh initially sought out Carrel to see if his sister-in-law's heart, damaged by [[rheumatic fever]], could be repaired. When Lindbergh saw the crudeness of Carrel's machinery, he offered to build new equipment for the scientist. Eventually they built the first perfusion pump, an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery. Lindbergh considered Carrel his closest friend, and said he would preserve and promote Carrel's ideals after his death.<ref name=\"Reggiani\"/>\n\nDue to his close proximity with [[Jacques Doriot]]'s fascist [[Parti Populaire Fran\u00e7ais]] (PPF) during the 1930s and his role in implementing eugenics policies during Vichy France, he was accused after the Liberation of collaboration, but died before the trial.\n\nIn his later life he returned to his Catholic roots. In 1939 he met with [[Trappist monk]] Alexis Presse on a recommendation. Although Carrel was skeptical about meeting with a priest,<ref name=\"Jaki\"/> Presse ended up having a profound influence on the rest of Carrel's life.<ref name=\"Reggiani\"/> In 1942, he said \"I believe in the existence of God, in the immortality of the soul, in Revelation and in all the Catholic Church teaches.\" He summoned Presse to administer the Catholic [[Sacrament]]s on his death bed in November 1944.<ref name=\"Jaki\"/>\n\nFor much of his life, Carrel and his wife spent their summers on the {{ill|\u00cele Saint-Gildas|fr}}, which they owned.

The technique of \"triangulation\", using three stay-sutures as traction points in order to minimize damage to the vascular wall during suturing, was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroideress and is still used today. Julius Comroe wrote: \"Between 1901 and 1910, Alexis Carrel, using experimental animals, performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today.\" He had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins, and performing surgical grafts, and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912.<ref name=\"simmons\">{{Cite book | title = Doctors and discoveries: lives that created today's medicine | author1=John G.

For this, Carrel was awarded the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].  Carrel also advocated the use of wound debridement (cutting away necrotic or otherwise damaged tissue) and irrigation of wounds.  His method of wound irrigation involved flushing the tissues with a high volume of antiseptic fluid so that dirt and other contaminants would be washed away (this is known today as \"mechanical irrigation.\")\n\n=== Organ transplants ===\nCarrel co-authored a book with famed pilot [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], ''The Culture of Organs'', and worked with Lindbergh in the mid-1930s to create the \"perfusion pump,\" which allowed living organs to exist outside the body during surgery. The advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of [[open-heart surgery]] and [[organ transplants]], and to have laid the groundwork for the [[artificial heart]], which became a reality decades later.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/innovators/bio_carrel2.html Red Gold .

This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]], and is now a pillar of biology.<ref name=\"Fossel2004\"/>\n\nL. Hayflick has shown that a cell has a limited number of divisions, equal to the so called \"Hayflick's Limit.\" However, L. Franks and others (Loo et al. 1987; Nooden and Tompson 1995; Frolkis 1988a), have shown that the number of cell divisions can be considerably greater than that stipulated by the \"Hayflick Limit\", having practically no limit at all.\n\nIt is not certain how Carrel obtained his anomalous results.

After the first six months, Carrel's colleague Albert Ebeling had actually taken charge of the cultures and published several papers about their development, until they were eventually discarded in 1946. Witkowski, in \"Dr. Carrel's immortal cells\", op. cit., quotes Buchbaum's account. At the end Buchbaum writes that \"I told this story, of my visit to Carrel's laboratory, to various people. Dr. Bloom (''Buchbaum's director of research in Chicago'')refused to believe it. Others chuckled gleefully. Dr. Carrel was to blame only in that he did not keep on top of what was really going on in the laboratory (mostly, he wrote the papers). Dr. Parker and Dr. Ebeling probably suspected something, hence the \"retirement\". In the interest of truth and science, the incident should have been thoroughly investigated. If it had been, some heads might have rolled, sacrificed to devotion to a wrong hypothesis - immortality of cell strains.\". Witkowski also reports Dr. Margaret Murray, an early tissue culturist, telling him that \"one of Carrel's technicians of that time was passionately anti-fascist and detested Carrel's political and social ideas\" and expressing her belief that \"this technician would willingly have discredited Carrel scientifically if possible.\"}}\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html The Nobel Stamps of 1972<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205201406/http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html |date=February 5, 2006 }}</ref> In 1979, the [[lunar crater]] [[Carrel (crater)|Carrel]] was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.\n\nIn February 2002, as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's birth, the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize, given to major contributors to \"development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth\".<ref name=\"Lindbergh Symposium\">{{cite web|url=http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/laureates.htm|title=Charles Lindbergh Symposium<!-- Bot generated title -->|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207000237/http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/laureates.htm |archivedate=2012-02-07}}</ref> [[Michael DeBakey]] and nine other scientists received the prize, a bronze statuette [http://www.fondazionecarrel.org/carrel/1.htm] created for the event by the Italian artist C.

They have been fascinated by the beauty of the sciences of inert matter. They have not understood that their body and consciousness are subjected to natural laws, more obscure than, but as inexorable as, the laws of the sidereal world. Neither have they understood that they cannot transgress these laws without being punished. They must,  therefore, learn the necessary relations of the cosmic universe, of their fellow men, and of their inner selves, and also those of their tissues and their mind. Indeed, man stands above all things. Should he degenerate, the beauty of civilization, and even the grandeur of the physical universe, would vanish. ... Humanity's attention must turn from the machines of the world of inanimate matter to the body and the soul of man, to the organic and mental processes which have created the machines and the universe of Newton and Einstein.<ref name=\"Carrel\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://communication.ucsd.edu/_files/Korzybski_The-Science-of-Man.pdf |first=Alfred |last=Korzybski |author-link=Alfred Korzybski |title=The Science of Man }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCarrell advocated, in part, that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals, and by incorporating eugenics into the social framework. He argued for an aristocracy springing from individuals of potential, writing:\n\n<blockquote>We must single out the children who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.<ref name=\"Carrel\" /> </blockquote>\n\nCarrel advocated the use of [[gas chambers|gasses]] to rid humanity of \"defectives\", thus endorsing the [[scientific racism]] [[discourse]]. His endorsement of this idea began in the mid-1930s, prior to the [[Nazi]] implementation of such practices in Germany. In the 1936 German introduction of his book, at the publisher's request, he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages:\n\n<blockquote>(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous.<ref>As quoted by Andr\u00e9s Horacio Reggiani: ''God's eugenicist. Alexis Carrel and the sociobiology of decline.'' Berghahn Books, Oxford 2007, p. 71. See ''Der Mensch, das unbekannte Wesen''. DVA, Stuttgart 1937.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor the insane and the criminal, he endorsed the use of gassing for euthanasia:\n\n<blockquote>(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts.<ref name=\"Carrel\" /> </blockquote>\n\nOtherwise he endorsed voluntary positive eugenics. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We have mentioned that natural selection has not played its part for a long while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved through the efforts of hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.<ref name=\"Carrel\" /> </blockquote>\n\nHe continued:\n\n{{quote|The progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. Children must be reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents. It is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of [[industrial civilization]]. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.\n\nThe free practice of eugenics could lead not only to the development of stronger individuals, but also of strains endowed with more endurance, intelligence, and courage. These strains should constitute an aristocracy, from which great men would probably appear. Modern society must promote, by all possible means, the formation of better human stock. No financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who, through the wisdom of their marriage, would engender geniuses. The complexity of our civilization is immense. No one can master all its mechanisms. However, these mechanisms have to be mastered. There is need today of men of larger mental and moral size, capable of accomplishing such a task. The establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eugenics would be an important step toward the solution of our present problems.<ref name=\"Carrel\" /> }}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Man, the Unknown"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Carrel"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Alexis"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Man, The Unknown"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1939"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Harper & Brothers"}, {"name": "location", "value": "New York"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://hpaba.com/pages/en/ALEXIS%20CARREL%20Man%20the%20Unknown%201935.pdf"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "28 June 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://communication.ucsd.edu/_files/Korzybski_The-Science-of-Man.pdf"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Alfred"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Korzybski"}, {"name": "author-link", "value": "Alfred Korzybski"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Science of Man"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "The progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence.
