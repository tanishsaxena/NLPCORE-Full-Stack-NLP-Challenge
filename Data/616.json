He composed many instrumental [[concerto]]s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty [[opera]]s. His best-known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]''.\n\nMany of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the ''[[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]'', a home for abandoned children.

It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedelt\u00e0 sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi\u2014the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.<ref>Heller, p. 40</ref>\n\nVivaldi's health was problematic.

Vivaldi said Mass as a priest only a few times, and appeared to have withdrawn from liturgical duties, though he formally remained a member of the priesthood.

The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as \"the famous composer and violinist\" and said that \"Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.\"<ref>Landon, p. 49</ref>\n\n[[File:8106 - Venezia - Calle della Piet\u00e0 - Lapide Vivaldi - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 8-Aug-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Commemorative plaque beside the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]\nVivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the orphanage.

The girls received a musical education, and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.\n\nShortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them.<ref>Heller, p. 77</ref> These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra.<ref>Heller, p. 78</ref> In 1704, the position of teacher of ''[[lyra viol|viola all'inglese]]'' was added to his duties as violin instructor.<ref name=Landon26>Landon, p. 26</ref> The position of ''maestro di coro'', which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work.

The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.\n\nDespite his frequent travels from 1718, the Ospedale paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The orphanage's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.\n\n===Opera impresario===\n[[File:Vivaldis first edition of Juditha triumphnas.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Juditha triumphans''<ref>[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html \"Vivaldi's Venice\"], baroquemusic.org. \"As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 perform his first great oratorio, ''Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric''. {{sic}} This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks in August 1716.\"</ref>]]\n\nIn early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.<ref>Heller, p. 98</ref> The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.\n\nDuring this period, the ''Piet\u00e0'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s. ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is now lost. The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|victory of the Republic of Venice]] against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage, both the female and male roles. Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments\u2014recorders, oboes, [[Viola d'amore|violas d'amore]], and mandolins\u2014that showcased the range of talents of the girls.<ref>Landon, p. 52</ref>\n\nAlso in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the years that followed, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.\n\n[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]\nHis progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing Vivaldi and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks the composer even as it does not mention him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure text under the engraving mentions non-existent places and names: for example, ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of \"A. Vivaldi\".\n\nIn a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his \"94 operas\". Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have been exaggerating, it is plausible that, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'', he may have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas\u2014given that his career had by then spanned almost 25 years.<ref>Heller, p. 97</ref> While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house.<ref name=Heller114>Heller, p. 114</ref>\n\n===Mantua and the'' Four Seasons''===\n{{Further|The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)}}\nIn 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]], in the northwest of Italy.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.</ref> He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Ges\u00f9'' (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.\n\nDuring this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera ''Il Giustino''. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le C\u00e8ne]] in 1725.\n\nDuring his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Gir\u00f2|Anna Tessieri Gir\u00f2]], who would become his student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and favorite ''[[prima donna]]''.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.</ref> Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, moved in with Vivaldi and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation as to the nature of Vivaldi's and Gir\u00f2's relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Vivaldi, in fact, adamantly denied any romantic relationship with Gir\u00f2 in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 67.</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\nAt the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The ''serenata'' (cantata) ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French [[ambassador]] to Venice in celebration of the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La cetra (Vivaldi)|La cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.\n\nAccompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented;<ref>Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E. Freeman, ''The Opera Theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).</ref> it garnered six revivals.<ref name=\"Heller114\" /> Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. ''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna. ''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].\n\nLike many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once had been in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]].<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179.</ref> The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Gir\u00f2.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180.</ref>\n\n[[File:Vivaldi caricature.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Caricature]] by P.

The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.\n\nDespite his frequent travels from 1718, the Ospedale paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice.

It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.<ref>Heller, p. 98</ref> The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.\n\nDuring this period, the ''Piet\u00e0'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s. ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is now lost. The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|victory of the Republic of Venice]] against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage, both the female and male roles. Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments\u2014recorders, oboes, [[Viola d'amore|violas d'amore]], and mandolins\u2014that showcased the range of talents of the girls.<ref>Landon, p. 52</ref>\n\nAlso in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the years that followed, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.\n\n[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]\nHis progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing Vivaldi and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks the composer even as it does not mention him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure text under the engraving mentions non-existent places and names: for example, ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of \"A. Vivaldi\".\n\nIn a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his \"94 operas\". Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have been exaggerating, it is plausible that, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'', he may have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas\u2014given that his career had by then spanned almost 25 years.<ref>Heller, p. 97</ref> While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house.<ref name=Heller114>Heller, p. 114</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 4}, {"title": "Mantua and the'' Four Seasons''", "paragraphs": "{{Further|The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)}}\nIn 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]], in the northwest of Italy.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.</ref> He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Ges\u00f9'' (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.\n\nDuring this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera ''Il Giustino''. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le C\u00e8ne]] in 1725.\n\nDuring his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Gir\u00f2|Anna Tessieri Gir\u00f2]], who would become his student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and favorite ''[[prima donna]]''.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.</ref> Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, moved in with Vivaldi and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation as to the nature of Vivaldi's and Gir\u00f2's relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Vivaldi, in fact, adamantly denied any romantic relationship with Gir\u00f2 in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M.

The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La cetra (Vivaldi)|La cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9.

''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].\n\nLike many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years.

The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced later by other artists, was made in 1725 by [[Fran\u00e7ois Morellon de La Cave]] for the first edition of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 147\u201348.</ref> The ink sketch, a [[caricature]], was done by [[Pier Leone Ghezzi|Ghezzi]] in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile. It exists in two versions: a first jotting kept at the [[Vatican Library]], and a much lesser-known, slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in Moscow.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 87.</ref> The oil painting, which can be seen in the [[International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna]], is anonymous and is thought to depict Vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the La Cave engraving.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 148.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Full citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "March 2019"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2017"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Style and influence", "paragraphs": "{{listen|type=music\n| filename     = 01 - Vivaldi Spring mvt 1 Allegro - John Harrison violin.ogg\n| title        = \"La primavera\" (Spring) \u2013 Movement 1: Allegro from the ''Four Seasons''\n| description  = A 2000 live performance by [[Wichita State University]] Chamber Players.\n}}\nVivaldi's music was innovative. He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes. Many of his compositions are flamboyantly exuberant.<!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? -->{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]]). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard: three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 580).<!-- That's four; what were the other two? --><ref name=\"TalbotGrove\" /><ref>Wolff and Emery.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "listen", "values": [{"name": "type", "value": "music"}, {"name": "filename", "value": "01 - Vivaldi Spring mvt 1 Allegro - John Harrison violin.ogg"}, {"name": "title", "value": "\"La primavera\" (Spring) \u2013 Movement 1: Allegro from the ''Four Seasons''"}, {"name": "description", "value": "A 2000 live performance by [[Wichita State University]] Chamber Players."}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2019"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Posthumous reputation", "paragraphs": "During his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries throughout Europe, including France, but after his death his popularity dwindled. After the end of the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown, and were largely ignored. Even his most famous work, ''The Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods.\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar [[Marc Pincherle]] to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the [[Turin National University Library]] as a result of the generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]] and [[Louis Kaufman]], all of whom were instrumental in the revival of Vivaldi throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn 1926, in a monastery in [[Piedmont]], researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.<ref>Antonio Vivaldi biography by Alexander Kuznetsov and Louise Thomas, a booklet attached to the CD \"The best of Vivaldi\", published and recorded by Madacy Entertainment Group Inc, St. Laurent Quebec Canada</ref>\n\nThe resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]] (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since [[World War II]], Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. [[Historically informed performance]]s, often on \"original instruments\", have increased Vivaldi's fame still further.\n\nRecent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and [[Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi)|Dixit Dominus]] (RV 807, in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] described RV 807 as \"arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since [\u2026] the 1920s\".<ref>Michael Talbot, liner notes to the CD ''Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus'', K\u00f6rnerscher Sing-Verein Dresden (Dresdner Instrumental-Concert), Peter Kopp, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] 2006, catalogue number 4776145</ref> Vivaldi's 1730 opera ''[[Argippo]]'' (RV 697), which had been considered lost, was rediscovered in 2006 by the [[harpsichordist]] and conductor Ond\u0159ej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at [[Prague Castle]] on 3 May 2008\u2014its first performance since 1730.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 8}, {"title": "Works", "paragraphs": "{{Main|List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi|List of operas by Antonio Vivaldi}}\n\nA composition by Vivaldi is identified by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], which refers to its place in the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\", a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist [[Peter Ryom]].\n\n[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work. Part of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'' (\"The Contest between Harmony and Invention\"), it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons.

About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[viola d'amore]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[lute]], or [[mandolin]]. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings, and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.\n\nAs well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music, such as [[Magnificat (Vivaldi)|Magnificat]]. Other works include [[sinfonia]]s, about 90 [[sonata]]s and chamber music.\n\nSome sonatas for flute, published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Ch\u00e9deville]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi"}, {"name": "2", "value": "List of operas by Antonio Vivaldi"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": "Catalogs of Vivaldi works", "paragraphs": "Vivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|here]]).\n\nBecause the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, Fanna numbers{{Clarify|reason=\"Fanna\" is not defined \u2013 was this a person?|date=November 2017}} were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B{{music|flat}} major, \"La Notte\" RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1\n\nDespite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older [[Marc Pincherle|Pincherle]] numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.\n\nThis cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] was both the director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.\n\nCompositions by Vivaldi are identified today by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], the number assigned by Danish musicologist [[Peter Ryom]] in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\". Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to \"adjacent\" works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works.{{Efn|These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at [http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php classical.net].}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Clarify", "values": [{"name": "reason", "value": "\"Fanna\" is not defined \u2013 was this a person?"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 2017"}]}, {"name": "music", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "flat"}]}, {"name": "Efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at [http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php classical.net]."}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "In popular culture", "paragraphs": "The movie ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vivaldi, a Prince in Venice|fr|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}'' was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Guillermou|fr|Jean-Louis Guillermou}}.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0463283|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}</ref> In 2005, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] commissioned a [[radio play]] about Vivaldi, which was written by [[Sean Riley (playwright)|Sean Riley]].
