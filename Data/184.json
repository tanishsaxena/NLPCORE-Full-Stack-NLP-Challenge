Occupying {{convert|652000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest. [[Kabul]] is the capital and largest city.  The population is 32 million, mostly composed of ethnic [[Pashtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]] and [[Uzbeks]].\n\nHuman habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] Era, and the country's strategic location along the [[Silk Road]] connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed [[Invasions of Afghanistan|numerous military campaigns]], including those by Alexander the Great, [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], Muslim Arabs, Mongols, British, Soviets, and by the United States with allied countries. The land also served as the source from which the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]], [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], [[Saffarid Empire|Saffarids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghorids]], [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Hotak Empire|Hotaks]], [[Durrani dynasty|Durranis]], and others have risen to form major empires.\n\nThe political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the \"[[The Great Game|Great Game]]\" between British India and the Russian Empire. Its border with British India, the [[Durand Line]], was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under [[Amanullah Khan]], until almost 50 years later when [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] was overthrown and a republic was established. In 1978, after a second coup Afghanistan first became a socialist state and then a Soviet protectorate. This evoked the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in the 1980s against [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|mujahideen]] rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist group the [[Taliban]], who ruled as a totalitarian regime for over five years. Following the 9/11 attacks, an intervention by the US and its allies forcibly removed the Taliban from power, and a new democratically-elected government was formed, but the Taliban still control a significant portion of the country.\n\nAfghanistan is a unitary presidential [[Islamic republic]]. The country has high levels of terrorism, poverty, child malnutrition, and corruption. It is a member of the United Nations, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[Group of 77]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by [[purchasing power parity]]; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "A landlocked south-central Asian country"}]}, {"name": "about", "values": [{"name": "2", "value": "the Japanese manga"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Afghanis-tan"}]}, {"name": "Use American English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2017"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox country\n", "values": [{"name": "conventional_long_name", "value": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, {"name": "common_name", "value": "Afghanistan"}, {"name": "native_name", "value": "{{vunblist\n |{{nobold|{{native name|ps|\u062f \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a \u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u062a|italic=no}}}}\n |{{small|''Da Af\u0121\u0101nist\u0101n Isl\u0101m\u012b Jumhoryat''}}\n |{{nobold|{{native name|prs|\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646|italic=no}}}}\n |{{small|''Jomh\u016br\u012b-ye Esl\u0101m\u012b-ye Af\u0121\u0101nest\u0101n''}}}}"}, {"name": "image_flag", "value": "File:Flag of Afghanistan.svg"}, {"name": "image_coat", "value": "National emblem of Afghanistan.svg"}, {"name": "symbol_type", "value": "National emblem"}, {"name": "symbol_type_article", "value": "Emblem of Afghanistan"}, {"name": "national_motto", "value": "{{nowrap|{{big|{{lang|ar|\u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}}}}}}<br />\"{{transl|ar|L\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h, Muhammadun ras\u016blu ll\u0101h}}\" <br />{{small|\"There is no God but [[Allah]]; [[Muhammad]] is the messenger of Allah.

In 1878, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] was fought over perceived Russian influence, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] replaced [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]], and Britain gained control of Afghanistan's [[foreign policy|foreign relations]] as part of the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] of 1879. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.

He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927\u201328 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory.

century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilization today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest [[Pakistan]] to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.<ref name=\"The Ancient Indus pp.1\">{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society|page=1|author=Rita Wright|date=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAgFPQAACAAJ|isbn=978-0521576529|access-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628065355/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAgFPQAACAAJ|archive-date=28 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998).

These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].<ref name=\"JFS\" /><ref>Bryant, Edwin F.

Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries.

Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].

In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]]s who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. They were replaced by the [[Turk Shahi]] in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called [[Hindu Shahi]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wink|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7Th-11th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&pg=PA125|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=0-391-04173-8|page=125|access-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201142728/https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&pg=PA125|archive-date=1 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by [[Buddhist]] culture.<ref name=\"Habibi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023100306/http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|archivedate=23 October 2008 |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Higham|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&pg=PA141|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|page=141}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society"}, {"name": "page", "value": "1"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Rita Wright"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=gAgFPQAACAAJ"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0521576529"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "11 December 2019"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160628065355/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAgFPQAACAAJ"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "28 June 2016"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "multiple image\n", "values": [{"name": "align", "value": "right"}, {"name": "direction", "value": "vertical"}, {"name": "image1", "value": "Buddha of Bamiyan.jpg"}, {"name": "width1", "value": "200"}, {"name": "caption1", "value": "The taller [[Buddha of Bamiyan]].

In 1878, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] was fought over perceived Russian influence, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] replaced [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]], and Britain gained control of Afghanistan's [[foreign policy|foreign relations]] as part of the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] of 1879. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.

He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927\u201328 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory.

In March 1989, mujahideen groups launched an attack on [[Jalalabad]], instigated by the Pakistani ISI, but the attack failed.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=241}} With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 and the ending of [[Russia]]n support, President Najibullah was left without foreign aid. In March 1991, mujahideen forces attacked and conquered the city of [[Khost]].\n\nIn March 1992, President Najibullah agreed to step aside and make way for a mujahideen coalition government. At this time there were seven main mujahideen groups: [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin|Hezb-e Islami (Gulbuddin faction)]], [[Hezb-i Islami Khalis|Hezb-e Islami (Khalis faction)]], [[Jamiat-e Islami]], [[Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan]], the [[National Islamic Front (Afghanistan)|National Islamic Front for Afghanistan]], the [[Jebh-e-Nejat-e Melli|National Liberation Front]], and the [[Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami|Islamic Revolution Movement]] . Their leaders [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|came together]] in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, to negotiate a coalition government, but Hezbi Islami's leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] refused to confer and instead invaded Kabul. This kicked off a civil war, starting 25 April 1992, between initially three, but within weeks five or six mujahideen groups.<ref name=\"Amin Saikal\">{{cite book |last=Amin Saikal |authorlink=Amin Saikal |title=Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival |edition=2006 1st |page=352 |publisher=I.B.
