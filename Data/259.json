War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|\"slave states\"]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years. Intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead, more than the number of U.S. military deaths in all other wars combined.{{Efn|At least until approximately the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts\n | title =Civil War Facts\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =August 16, 2011\n | website =American Battlefield Trust\n | publisher = American Battlefield Trust\n | access-date = October 7, 2018\n | quote =}}</ref>}}\n\nThe war [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|effectively ended]] April 9, 1865, when General [[Robert E.

The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

Later, in September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.<ref name=\"proclamation\" /> To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865.

It was also fading in the border states and in Southern cities, but it was expanding in the highly profitable cotton districts of the rural South and Southwest. Subsequent writers on the American Civil War looked to several factors explaining the geographic divide.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Territorial crisis===\n{{Further|Slave states and free states}}\nBetween 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest. At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49\u201350}}\n\nWith the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190\u201393}}\nNorthern \"free soil\" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the Southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13\u201314}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: \"The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.\"{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| width =\n| image1 = Stephen Arnold Douglas.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| caption1 = Sen.

The [[Crittenden Compromise]] of 1860 was an expression of this view.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=20}}\n\nThe second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance\u2014that slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 at the discretion of Congress;{{sfn|Russell|1966|p=468\u201369}} thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it.

Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648\u2013649}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war.

The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Origins of the American Civil War"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w_2odcYG-swC|page=99}}"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Road to Disunion: Volume II: Secessionists Triumphant, 1854\u20131861"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Freehling"}, {"name": "first", "value": "William W."}, {"name": "date", "value": "October 1, 2008"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford University Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780199839919"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "9\u201324"}]}, {"name": "google books ", "values": [{"name": "plainurl", "value": "y"}, {"name": "id", "value": "w_2odcYG-swC"}, {"name": "page", "value": "99"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "{{google books |plainurl=y |id=X_JGtAEACAAJ|page=111}}"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress: 1789-1988"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Martis"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Kenneth C."}, {"name": "date", "value": "1989"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780029201701"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "111\u2013115"}]}, {"name": "google books ", "values": [{"name": "plainurl", "value": "y"}, {"name": "id", "value": "X_JGtAEACAAJ"}, {"name": "page", "value": "111"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "{{google books |plainurl=y |id=rQSYk-LWTxcC|page=18}}"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Foner"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Eric"}, {"name": "date", "value": "October 2, 1980"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford University Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780199727087"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "18\u201320, 21\u201324"}]}, {"name": "google books ", "values": [{"name": "plainurl", "value": "y"}, {"name": "id", "value": "rQSYk-LWTxcC"}, {"name": "page", "value": "18"}]}, {"name": "cite magazine", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Coates"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Ta-Nehisi"}, {"name": "title", "value": "What This Cruel War Was Over"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "December 21, 2016"}, {"name": "magazine", "value": "The Atlantic"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 22, 2015"}]}, {"name": "center", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "'''Status of the states, 1861'''"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#A40000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "States that seceded before April 15, 1861"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#EF2929"}, {"name": "2", "value": "States that seceded after April 15, 1861"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#FCE94F"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Union states that permitted slavery"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#204A87"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Union states that banned slavery"}]}, {"name": "legend", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "#D3D7CF"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Territories"}]}, {"name": "cite speech", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Gallagher"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Gary"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Remembering the Civil War"}, {"name": "event", "value": "Sesquicentennial of the Start of the Civil War"}, {"name": "date", "value": "February 21, 2011"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Miller Center of Public Affairs UV"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "C-Span"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.c-span.org/video/?298125-1/remembering-civil-war"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "August 29, 2017"}, {"name": "language", "value": "English"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "Issues related to the institution of slavery precipitated secession...

Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas.

In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work.

Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed.

The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats.

In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States.

Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464\u2013519}}<ref name=\"terrible\" />{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424\u201327}}\n\nAlso in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}\n\n;Second Bull Run\nThe [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528\u201333}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.\n\n;Antietam\n[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]\n\nEmboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543\u201345}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it.

Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=571\u201374}} on December 13, 1862, when more than 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].\n[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Confederate dead overrun at Marye's Heights, reoccupied next day May 4, 1863]]\n;Chancellorsville\nHooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, his Chancellorsville Campaign proved ineffective and he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=639\u201345}} Chancellorsville is known as Lee's \"perfect battle\" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory.

That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west. The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the [[Battle of Salem Church]].\n\n;Gettysburg\n[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L.

The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect.

Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J.

Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}\n\n;Second Bull Run\nThe [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528\u201333}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.\n\n;Antietam\n[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]\n\nEmboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543\u201345}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it.

That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west.

Ewell|Ewell]]'s May 1864 attack at [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]]\u2014delayed Grant's advance on Richmond in the [[Overland Campaign]].]]\n\n=== Grant's Overland Campaign ===\nGrant's army set out on the [[Overland Campaign]] with the goal of drawing Lee into a defense of Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778\u201379}}\n\n=== Sherman's March to the Sea ===\nMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=773\u201376}} Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin\u2013Nashville Campaign]]. Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=812\u201315}}[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|thumb|''[[The Peacemakers]]'' by [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] portrays [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]], [[Ulysses S.

He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825\u201330}}\n\n=== The Waterloo of the Confederacy ===\nLee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called \"the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy\") on April 1.

The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France.

Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly.

See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.

Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves.

The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly.

Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L. Livermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths at 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a total of 260,000 deaths.<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\" /> However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.\n\nThe United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses:<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/>\n\n'''Union: 853,838'''\n* 110,100 killed in action\n* 224,580 disease deaths\n* 275,154 wounded in action\n* 211,411 captured (including 30,192 who died as POWs)\n\n'''Confederate: 914,660'''\n* 94,000 killed in action\n* 164,000 disease deaths\n* 194,026 wounded in action\n* 462,634 captured (including 31,000 who died as POWs)\n\n[[File:Burial of the dead on the Antietam battlefield army.mil-2008-09-10-145638.jpg|thumb|Burying Union dead on the [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] battlefield, 1862]]\n\nWhile the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. [[Francis Amasa Walker]], superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.<ref name=\"recounting\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307\u201348}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.\n\nDeaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1 million.<ref>Professor James Downs. \"Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction\".

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]s, and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open.

By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves \"...&nbsp;cannot be neutral.

From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, \"If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat.

They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army.

There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections.

Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and who write for the general public, rather than the scholarly community.

Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black [[Baptists|Baptist]] preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:\n{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission\u2014to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\nIn sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:\n{{quote|God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\n===Lost Cause===\n{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.<ref name=\"confederacy84\" /> Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.</ref>}}\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=9780307809605}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield preservation===\n[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[Commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]\n\nThe first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga. Soldiers began erecting markers on battlefields beginning with the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but the oldest surviving monument is the Hazen monument, erected at Stones River near [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], in the summer of 1863 by soldiers in Union Col.

The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899. In 1933, these five parks and other national monuments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.<ref>Timothy B. Smith, \"The Golden Age of Battlefield Preservation\" (2008; The University of Tennessee Press).</ref>\n\nThe modern Civil War battlefield preservation movement began in 1987 with the founding of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), a grassroots organization created by Civil War historians and others to preserve battlefield land by acquiring it. In 1991, the original Civil War Trust was created in the mold of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of U.S. Mint Civil War commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation. Although the two non-profit organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions, ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger, which happened in 1999 with the creation of the Civil War Preservation Trust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behind-the-bitter-war-to-preserve-the-civil-war-battlefields/2017/07/21/6a1c8dd4-6591-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html] The Washington Post, July 21, 2007, \"\"Behind the bitter war to preserve Civil War battlefields.\" Accessed May 30, 2018.</ref> In 2011, the organization was renamed, again becoming the [[Civil War Trust]].
