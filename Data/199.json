What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues.|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOnly limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction.<ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/> Unlike D&E, labor-induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth.

What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues."}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "25 September 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "2015 Clinical Policy Guidelines"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "National Abortion Federation"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2015"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2015_NAF_CPGs.pdf"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "30 October 2015"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "Policy Statement: Medical induction abortion is a safe and effective method for termination of pregnancies beyond the first trimester when performed by trained clinicians in medical offices, freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and hospitals.

aspiration'' (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques can both be used very early in pregnancy. MVA can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the U.S. EVA can be used later.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMVA, also known as \"mini-suction\" and \"[[menstrual extraction]]\" or EVA can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&C) refers to opening the cervix (dilation) and removing tissue (curettage) via suction or sharp instruments. D&C is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends ''sharp curettage'' only when suction aspiration is unavailable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors|author=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2017|isbn=978-92-4-154587-7|location=Geneva|chapter=Dilatation and curettage|oclc=181845530|accessdate=30 July 2019|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&E), used after 12 to 16 weeks, consists of opening the [[cervix]] and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction. D&E is performed vaginally and does not require an incision. [[Intact dilation and extraction]](D&X) refers to a variant of D&E sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dilation and evacuation.

[[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy.  Gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy.  Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&E or induction abortion.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 2013|title=Practice Bulletin No. 135: Second-Trimester Abortion|journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology|language=en|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1394\u20131406|doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000431056.79334.cc|pmid=23812485|issn=0029-7844|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ace83a00d019d5dac64fd15e50a474b1e313e20a}}</ref>\n\nFirst-trimester procedures can generally be performed using [[local anesthesia]], while second-trimester methods may require [[Sedation#Levels of sedation|deep sedation]] or [[general anesthesia]].<ref name=\"NEJMDec2011\">{{Cite journal |last1=Templeton |first1=A. |last2=Grimes |first2=D.A. |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp1103639 |pmid=22150038 |title=A Request for Abortion |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=365 |issue=23 |pages=2198\u20132204 |year=2011 |doi-access=free  }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Healthwise"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "website", "value": "WebMD"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "5 December 2008"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070211155626/http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "11 February 2007"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors"}, {"name": "author", "value": "World Health Organization"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "World Health Organization"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2017"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-92-4-154587-7"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Geneva"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Dilatation and curettage"}, {"name": "oclc", "value": "181845530"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "30 July 2019"}, {"name": "chapterurl", "value": "http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Dilation and evacuation.

The [[right to life]], the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.\n\nIn jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered [[feticide]]). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' [[Fetal viability|viability]].

These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.\n\nFar more common than physical violence is psychological pressure. In 2003, Chris Danze organized anti-abortion organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a [[Planned Parenthood]] facility in Austin. The organizations [[doxing|released the personal information]] online, of those involved with construction, sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacting their churches.<ref name=Doan>{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation:The abortion wars and strategies of political harassment|author=Alesha E.
