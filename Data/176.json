Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to [[dairy farming]], with [[mixed farming]] more common in the north and centre, while [[ranch]]ing and [[Irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] predominate in the south.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Alberta|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada|year=2008|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alberta|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Alberta [[badlands]] are located in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlberta has a [[humid continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from {{convert|-54|C|sigfig=2}} in northern Alberta to {{convert|-46|C|sigfig=2}} in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare.\n[[File:Alberta K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in Alberta]]\nIn the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from {{convert|32|C}} in the mountains to over {{convert|40|C}} in southeastern Alberta.<ref name=\"climatlas\">{{cite web|title=Climate of Alberta|work=Agroclimatic Atlas of Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|year=2003|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sag6299|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}</ref> Alberta is a sunny province.

Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.<ref name=\"climatlas\"/>\n\nAlberta extends for over {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from {{convert|0|C|sigfig=2}} in the southwest to {{convert|-24|C|sigfig=2}} in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[Westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} in the southeast to {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach {{convert|600|mm|abbr=on}} annually.<ref name=\"aboutab\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Weather and Climate Data|publisher=Government of Alberta, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development|year=2012|url=http://agriculture.alberta.ca/acis|accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe province is the namesake of the [[Alberta clipper]], a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar [[Jet stream|jetstream]] descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.<ref name=\"Alberta Clipper\">{{cite web|title=Alberta Clipper|url=http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219182706/http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archivedate=2015-02-19|publisher=The Weather Notebook|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around {{convert|21|C}} in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around {{convert|28|C}} in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding.\n\nIn southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry [[chinook wind]]s blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at [[Pincher Creek]], temperatures soared from {{convert|-19|to|22|C|sigfig=2}} in just one hour.<ref name=\"aboutab\"/> The region around [[Lethbridge]] has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year.

These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres.

Bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta.]]\nThe four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[Taiga|boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.\n\n[[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tailed deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]].\n\nAlberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], fox, [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[Cougar|mountain lion]] (cougar).\n[[File:Bear-Proof Garbage Can Lake Louise.jpg|thumb|A bear proof garbage can in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]]. Bears are found in the province's wooded and mountainous areas.]]\nCentral and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[Esox|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. [[Bull trout]], native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province.

Other [[Geological formation|formations]] have been recorded as well, like the [[Milk River Formation|Milk River]] and Foremost Formations. However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops. Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites. Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the [[Belly River Group]] and [[St. Mary River Formation]]s of the southwest and the northwestern [[Wapiti Formation]]. The Wapiti Formation contains two ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however. The [[Bearpaw Formation]] represents strata deposited during a [[marine transgression]].

Average high temperatures in January range from {{convert|0|C|sigfig=2}} in the southwest to {{convert|-24|C|sigfig=2}} in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[Westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} in the southeast to {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach {{convert|600|mm|abbr=on}} annually.<ref name=\"aboutab\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Weather and Climate Data|publisher=Government of Alberta, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development|year=2012|url=http://agriculture.alberta.ca/acis|accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe province is the namesake of the [[Alberta clipper]], a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar [[Jet stream|jetstream]] descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.<ref name=\"Alberta Clipper\">{{cite web|title=Alberta Clipper|url=http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219182706/http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archivedate=2015-02-19|publisher=The Weather Notebook|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around {{convert|21|C}} in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around {{convert|28|C}} in the dry prairie of the southeast.

The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding.\n\nIn southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry [[chinook wind]]s blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period.

Both yellow and white [[Melilotus|sweet clover]] can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.\n\nThe trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] (or in some parts [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]]), and [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Pinophyta|Conifers]] include [[jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[Larix laricina|tamarack]].\n\n==== Fauna ====\n[[File:Bighorn Sheep - Kananaskis.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bighorn sheep]] in [[Kananaskis Country]]. Bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta.]]\nThe four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[Taiga|boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.\n\n[[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tailed deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]].\n\nAlberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], fox, [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[Cougar|mountain lion]] (cougar).\n[[File:Bear-Proof Garbage Can Lake Louise.jpg|thumb|A bear proof garbage can in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]]. Bears are found in the province's wooded and mountainous areas.]]\nCentral and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[Esox|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. [[Bull trout]], native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.\n\nAlberta is the only province in Canada\u2014as well as one of the few places in the world\u2014that is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument | title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta| publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=January 11, 2007}}</ref> Since the early 1950s, the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.

Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of [[Franco-Albertans|Alberta's French-speaking residents]] live in the central and northwestern regions of the province, after migration from other areas of Canada or descending from M\u00e9tis.\n\nAs reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic [[Chinatown]]s, and Calgary has Canada's third-largest Chinese community.

The [[Wildrose Party]], a more conservative party formed in early 2008, gained much support in the [[2012 Alberta General Election|2012 election]] and became the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|official opposition]], a role it held until 2017 when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new [[United Conservative Party]] created by the merger of Wildrose and the Progressive Conservatives.

In 1917, due to pressures of [[World War&nbsp;I]], the [[Alberta Provincial Police]] was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a [[Great Depression]] era cost cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the now renamed [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP \"K\" Division. With the advent of the [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], the distribution of duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforcement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the Premier of Alberta have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the [[Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams]] (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it.

In 1917, due to pressures of [[World War&nbsp;I]], the [[Alberta Provincial Police]] was created.

The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K\u201312 education provided by school boards.
