It is a [[brand]] marketed by [[Verizon Media]].\n\nThe service traces its history to an [[online service]] known as [[PlayNET]], which hosted [[Game#Multiplayer_games|multi-player games]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, [[Quantum Link]] (Q-Link), who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter. The initial Q-Link service was similar to the original PlayNET, but over time Q-Link added many new services. When a new [[IBM PC]] client was released, the company focussed on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name America Online. The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like [[CompuServe]] and [[The Source (online service)|The Source]]. By 1995, AOL had about 3 million active users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/1995/09/aol-2/|title=America, Online!|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAOL was one of the early pioneers of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States.

In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate [[Time Warner]] in the largest merger in U.S. history.

AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers]] dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link]] service in 1985.  Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.  Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN.  Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help.  During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.\n\nTwo former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]] against AOL, citing violations of [[United States labor law|U.S. labor laws]] in its use of community leaders.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001.<ref name=\"cisn\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Postigo  | first = Hector\n  | title = America Online volunteers\n  | journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 5\n  | pages = 451\u2013469\n  | year = 2009\n  | doi = 10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>  AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005.  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.\n\nWithin one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.\n\nIn February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a US$15&nbsp;million payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of US$1.2&nbsp;million for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.\n\nPrior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual \"strike\" or \"sit-in\" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).\n\n=== Billing disputes ===\nAOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Account cancellation ===\nMany customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or \"save\" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or \"save\" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or \"save\" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum \"save\" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\"/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name=\"pcworld.com\">{{cite magazine| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |magazine= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13447232 |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.<ref>Popken, Ben.

The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15&nbsp;million, without admission of wrongdoing.<ref>[http://www.gardencitygroup.com/cases/pdf/AOL/AOLNotice.pdf Gardencitygroup.com] (PDF).

AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to \"Flames and complaints about America Online\". With AOL clients swarming [[Usenet]] newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as [[Eternal September]].<ref>[http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/pages/chapter03/ch03_.html \"The Making of an Underclass: AOL\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505003755/http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/pages/chapter03/ch03_.html |date=May 5, 2011}} ''[[net.wars]]'' Chapter 3, Wendy M.

During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.\n\nThere have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.<ref>[http://www.aolwatch.org/censory.htm Aolwatch.org].

AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers]] dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link]] service in 1985.  Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.  Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN.  Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help.  During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.\n\nTwo former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]] against AOL, citing violations of [[United States labor law|U.S. labor laws]] in its use of community leaders.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001.<ref name=\"cisn\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Postigo  | first = Hector\n  | title = America Online volunteers\n  | journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies\n  | volume = 12\n  | issue = 5\n  | pages = 451\u2013469\n  | year = 2009\n  | doi = 10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>  AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005.  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.\n\nWithin one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.\n\nIn February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a US$15&nbsp;million payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of US$1.2&nbsp;million for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.\n\nPrior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual \"strike\" or \"sit-in\" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite journal\n  ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Postigo"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Hector"}, {"name": "title", "value": "America Online volunteers"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "International Journal of Cultural Studies"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "12"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "5"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "451\u2013469"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1177/1367877909337858"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": " Billing disputes ", "paragraphs": "AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user.

Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices.

After the shutdown of Lifestream, clicking \"Buddy Info\" does something that provides no information whatsoever about the selected buddy:  it causes the [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] home page (www.aim.com) to be displayed.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "AOL Lifestream Sunset Notification"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://help.aol.com/articles/aol-lifestream-sunset-notification"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "April 13, 2017"}]}], "id": 25}, {"title": " See also ", "paragraphs": "{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[List of S&P 400 companies]]\n* [[Adrian Lamo]] \u2013 Inside-AOL.com\n* [[AOL Explorer]]\n* [[AOL Radio]]\n* [[AOL RED]]\n* [[AOHell]]\n* [[ART image file format]] .art\n* [[Comparison of webmail providers]]\n* [[Dot-com bubble]]\n* [[List of acquisitions by AOL]]\n* [[Live365]]\n* [[Sessions@AOL]]\n* [[Truveo]]\n* [[David Shing]]\n{{colend}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cols", "values": [{"name": "colwidth", "value": "16em"}]}], "id": 26}, {"title": " References ", "paragraphs": "{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Reflist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "30em"}]}], "id": 27}, {"title": " External links ", "paragraphs": "<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n{{Commons category|AOL}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Coord|40.7308|-73.9914|type:landmark_region:US-NY|display=title}}\n{{AOL Inc.}}\n{{Verizon Media}}\n{{Portal bar|Companies|Business and economics|Internet|New York City|United States}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:AOL| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Dulles, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 2009]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Internet services supporting OpenID]]\n[[Category:Former Time Warner subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Web service providers]]\n[[Category:Pre\u2013World Wide Web online services]]\n[[Category:Companies in the PRISM network]]\n[[Category:1983 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Web portals]]\n[[Category:Verizon Media]]\n[[Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions]]", "attributes": [{"name": "Commons category", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "AOL"}]}, {"name": "Coord", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "40.7308"}, {"name": "2", "value": "-73.9914"}, {"name": "3", "value": "type:landmark_region:US-NY"}, {"name": "display", "value": "title"}]}, {"name": "Portal bar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Companies"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Business and economics"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Internet"}, {"name": "4", "value": "New York City"}, {"name": "5", "value": "United States"}]}], "id": 28}]}
