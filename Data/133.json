Today, abacuses are often constructed as a [[bamboo]] frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves of sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.\n\nAbacuses come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach [[arithmetic]], although they remain popular in the [[post-Soviet states]] as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese [[soroban]], have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there are usually numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating [[square root]]s. Some of these methods may work with non-[[Natural number|natural]] numbers (numbers such as {{Math|1.5}} and {{Math|{{Frac|3|4}}}}).\n\nAlthough today many use [[calculator]]s and [[computer]]s instead of abacuses to calculate, abacuses still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[Africa]] use abacuses, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children.<ref name=\"Boyer253\" /> Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Redirect2", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Abaci"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Abacuses"}, {"name": "3", "value": "the Turkish Surname"}, {"name": "4", "value": "Abac\u0131 (disambiguation){{!}}Abac\u0131"}, {"name": "5", "value": "the medieval book"}, {"name": "6", "value": "Liber Abaci"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Calculating tool"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2013"}]}, {"name": "EngvarA", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2016"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Boyer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Merzbach"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "252\u2013253"}]}, {"name": "Math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1.5"}]}, {"name": "Math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{Frac|3|4}}"}]}, {"name": "Frac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3"}, {"name": "2", "value": "4"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Etymology", "paragraphs": "The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus.

It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam; beads moved toward the beam are counted, while those moved away from it are not.<ref name=\"ryerson\">{{harvnb|Fernandes|2003}}</ref> The ''suanpan'' can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.\n\nThe prototype of the Chinese abacus appeared during the [[Han Dynasty]], and the beads are oval. The [[Song Dynasty]] and earlier used the 1:4 type or four-beads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as Japanese-style abacus.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn the early [[Ming Dynasty]], the abacus began to appear in the form of 1:5 abacus. The upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn the late Ming Dynasty, the abacus styles appeared in the form of 2:5.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}  The upper deck had two beads, and the bottom had five beads.\n\nVarious calculation techniques were devised for ''Suanpan'' enabling efficient calculations. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.\n\nIn the long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131297), a ''suanpan'' is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).\n\nThe similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard ''suanpan'' has 5 plus 2. Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system (or any [[Radix|base]] up to 18) which may have been used for traditional Chinese measures of weight. (Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.\n\nAnother possible source of the ''suanpan'' is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.\n\n===Roman===\n{{Main|Roman abacus}}\n[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]\nThe normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=18}}</ref> Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2010|pp=81\u201382}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2011}}</ref> This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.<ref>{{harvnb|Huff|1993|p=50}}</ref>\n\nWriting in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.<ref name=rome>{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=18}}</ref>\n\nOne example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives \u2013five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman \"ounces\" (i.e. fractions).\n\n===Indian===\n\n\nThe ''[[Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher [[Vasumitra]] said that \"placing a wick (Sanskrit ''vartik\u0101'') on the number one (''ek\u0101\u1e45ka'') means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand\".  It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been. Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.<ref>{{harvnb|K\u00f6rner|1996|p=232}}</ref> Hindu texts used the term ''\u015b\u016bnya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.<ref>{{harvnb|Mollin|1998|p=3}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese===\n{{Main|Soroban}}\n[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|Japanese [[soroban]]]]\nIn Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7b97\u76e4, \u305d\u308d\u3070\u3093}}, lit. \"Counting tray\"), imported from China in the 14th century.<ref name=Gul>{{harvnb|Gullberg|1997|p=169}}</ref> It was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started, as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=65}}</ref> The 1/4 abacus, which removes the seldom used second and fifth bead became popular in the 1940s.\n\nToday's Japanese abacus is a 1:4 type, four-bead abacus was introduced from China in the Muromachi era. It adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads. The top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the Chinese or Korean abacus, and the decimal number can be expressed, so the abacus is designed as one four abacus. The beads are always in the shape of a diamond. The quotient division is generally used instead of the division method; at the same time, in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication. Later, Japan had a 3:5 abacus called\u5929\u4e09\u7b97\u76e4, which is now the Ize Rongji collection of Shansi Village in Yamagata City. There were also had 2:5 beads abacus.\nWith the four-bead abacus spread, it is also common to use Japanese abacus around the world. There are also improved Japanese abacus in various places. One of the Japanese-made abacus made in China is an aluminum frame plastic bead abacus. The file is next to the four beads, and the \"clearing\" button, press the clearing button, immediately put the upper bead to the upper position, the lower bead is dialed to the lower position, immediately clearing, easy to use.\n\nThe abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1982}}</ref>\n\n===Korean===\nThe Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.<ref name=Will>{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=55}}</ref><ref name=\"thocp\">{{harvnb|Anon|2002}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jami|1998|p=4}}</ref> Koreans call it ''jupan'' (\uc8fc\ud310), ''supan'' (\uc218\ud310) or ''jusan'' (\uc8fc\uc0b0).<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}</ref>\nThe four beads abacus( 1:4 ) was introduced to Korea Goryeo Dynasty from the China during Song Dynasty, later the five beads abacus (5:1) abacus was introduced to Korean from China during the Ming Dynasty.\n\n===Native American===\n[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Inca]] [[quipu]]]]\n[[File:Yupana 1.png|thumb|A [[yupana]] as used by the Incas.]]\nSome sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Aztec]] culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Sanyal|2008}}</ref> This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}</ref>\nThe word Nep\u014dhualtzintzin {{IPA-nah|nepo\u02d0wa\u026c\u02c8t\u0361sint\u0361sin|}} comes from [[Nahuatl]] and it is formed by the roots; ''Ne'' \u2013 personal -; ''p\u014dhual'' or ''p\u014dhualli'' {{IPA-nah|\u02c8po\u02d0wal\u02d0i|}} \u2013 the account -; and ''tzintzin'' {{IPA-nah|\u02c8t\u0361sint\u0361sin|}} \u2013 small similar elements. Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the [[Calmecac]] to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|tema\u026c\u02c8po\u028dke\u0294|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.\n\nThe Nep\u014dhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.\n\nAltogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nep\u014dhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nep\u014dhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{sfrac|1|4}} days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nep\u014dhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in [[floating point]], which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Nep\u014dhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,<ref>{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|p=94}}</ref> who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.<ref>{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|pp=94\u2013101}}</ref> There have also been found very old Nep\u014dhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]] culture, and even some bracelets of [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.\n\nGeorge I. Sanchez, \"Arithmetic in Maya\", Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.\n\nThe [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data,<ref>{{harvnb|Albree|2000|p=42}}</ref> like advanced [[tally stick]]s \u2013 but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for \"counting tool\"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.<ref>{{harvnb|Aimi|De Pasquale|2005}}</ref>\n\n===Russian===\n[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]\nThe Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' ({{Lang-ru|\u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442\u044b}}, plural from {{Lang-ru|\u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442}}, counting), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.\n\nAs a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.<ref>{{harvnb|Burnett|Ryan|1998|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hudgins|2004|p=219}}</ref> Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{harvnb|Leushina|1991|p=427}}</ref> The Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.\n\nThe Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Trogeman|Ernst|2001|p=24}}</ref> The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods.

It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam; beads moved toward the beam are counted, while those moved away from it are not.<ref name=\"ryerson\">{{harvnb|Fernandes|2003}}</ref> The ''suanpan'' can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.\n\nThe prototype of the Chinese abacus appeared during the [[Han Dynasty]], and the beads are oval. The [[Song Dynasty]] and earlier used the 1:4 type or four-beads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as Japanese-style abacus.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn the early [[Ming Dynasty]], the abacus began to appear in the form of 1:5 abacus.

There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.\n\nIn the long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131297), a ''suanpan'' is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).\n\nThe similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard ''suanpan'' has 5 plus 2. Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system (or any [[Radix|base]] up to 18) which may have been used for traditional Chinese measures of weight. (Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.\n\nAnother possible source of the ''suanpan'' is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder.

It adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads. The top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the Chinese or Korean abacus, and the decimal number can be expressed, so the abacus is designed as one four abacus. The beads are always in the shape of a diamond. The quotient division is generally used instead of the division method; at the same time, in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication. Later, Japan had a 3:5 abacus called\u5929\u4e09\u7b97\u76e4, which is now the Ize Rongji collection of Shansi Village in Yamagata City. There were also had 2:5 beads abacus.\nWith the four-bead abacus spread, it is also common to use Japanese abacus around the world. There are also improved Japanese abacus in various places.

The file is next to the four beads, and the \"clearing\" button, press the clearing button, immediately put the upper bead to the upper position, the lower bead is dialed to the lower position, immediately clearing, easy to use.\n\nThe abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation.

In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.\n\nAltogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nep\u014dhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nep\u014dhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{sfrac|1|4}} days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nep\u014dhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in [[floating point]], which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Nep\u014dhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,<ref>{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|p=94}}</ref> who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.<ref>{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|pp=94\u2013101}}</ref> There have also been found very old Nep\u014dhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]] culture, and even some bracelets of [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.\n\nGeorge I.

This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles.

Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for \"counting tool\"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument.

During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads.
