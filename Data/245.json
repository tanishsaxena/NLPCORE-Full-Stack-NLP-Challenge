Alex's friends (\"droogs\" in the novel's Anglo-Russian [[slang]], \"[[Nadsat]]\") are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser, who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. Characterised as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] and hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex also displays intelligence, quick wit, and a predilection for classical music; he is particularly fond of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], referred to as \"Lovely Ludwig Van\".\n\nThe novella begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, and drinking \"milk-plus\" \u2013 a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice \u2013 to prepare for a night of mayhem. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. [[Joyride (crime)|Joyriding]] through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and [[rape|raping]] his wife. In a [[metafiction]]al touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called \"''A Clockwork Orange''\", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him [[orgasm]]ic bliss before falling asleep.\n\nAlex coyly feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid, his \"post-corrective adviser\", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. That night after a nap, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a \"man-sized\" job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie. Then, in a show of generosity, he takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious; but, when he opens the door to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.\n\n===Part 2: The Ludovico Technique===\nAlex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in [[Wandsworth Prison]]. His parents visit one day to inform him that Georgie has been killed in a botched robbery. Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels, playing [[Christian music]] on the stereo to accompany the Sunday Christian services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's [[Bible]] studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental [[behaviour modification]] treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of [[aversion therapy]], in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an [[unintended consequence]], the soundtrack to one of the films, [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]], renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.\n\nThe effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of [[VIP]]s, who watch as Alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations. Although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released from prison.\n\n===Part 3: After prison===\nAlex returns to his parents' flat, only to find that they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but they turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the [[gang rape]]. He does not recognise Alex but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.\n\nAlex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. Placed in a [[mental institution]], Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government. A round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects, \"I was cured all right.\"\n\nIn the final chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick, Bully). After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children could possibly end up being just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Part 1: Alex's world", "paragraphs": "[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] is a 15-year-old living in a near-future dystopian city who leads his gang on a night of opportunistic, random \"ultra-violence\".

He often refers to himself as \"Your Humble Narrator\". Having coaxed two ten-year-old girls into his bedroom, Alex refers to himself as \"Alexander the Large\" while raping them; this was later the basis for Alex's claimed surname ''DeLarge'' in the 1971 film.\n* '''George''', '''Georgie''' or '''Georgie Boy''': Effectively Alex's greedy second-in-command. Georgie attempts to undermine Alex's status as leader of the gang and take over their gang as the new leader. He is later killed during a botched robbery while Alex is in prison.\n* '''Pete''': The only one who does not take particular sides when the droogs fight among themselves. He later meets and marries a girl named Georgina, renouncing his violent ways and even losing his former ([[Nadsat]]) speech patterns. A chance encounter with Pete in the final chapter influences Alex to realise that he has grown bored with violence and recognise that human energy is better expended on creation than destruction.<ref>[http://thefloatinglibrary.com/2009/04/20/a-clockwork-orange-resucked/ A Clockwork Orange Resucked].

He later becomes a police officer, exacting his revenge on Alex for the abuse he once suffered under his command.\n* '''P. R. Deltoid''': A criminal rehabilitation social worker assigned the task of keeping Alex on the straight and narrow. He seemingly has no clue about dealing with young people, and is devoid of empathy or understanding for his troublesome charge. Indeed, when Alex is arrested for murdering an old woman and then ferociously beaten by several police officers, Deltoid simply spits on him.\n* '''Prison Chaplain''': The character who first questions whether it is moral to turn a violent person into a behavioural automaton who can make no choice in such matters. This is the only character who is truly concerned about Alex's welfare; he is not taken seriously by Alex, though. He is nicknamed by Alex \"prison charlie\" or \"chaplin\", a pun on [[Charlie Chaplin]].\n* '''Billyboy''': A rival of Alex's. Early on in the story, Alex and his droogs battle Billyboy and his droogs, which ends abruptly when the police arrive. Later, after Alex is released from prison, Billyboy (along with Dim, who like Billyboy has become a police officer) rescues Alex from a mob, then subsequently beats him in a location out of town.\n* '''Prison Governor''': The man who decides to let Alex \"choose\" to be the first reformed by the Ludovico technique.\n* '''The Minister of the Interior''': The government high-official who determined that the Ludovico's technique will be used to cut [[recidivism]]. He is referred to as ''the Inferior'' by Alex.\n* '''Dr. Branom''': A scientist, co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He appears friendly and almost paternal towards Alex at first, before forcing him into the theatre and what Alex calls the \"chair of torture\".\n* '''Dr. Brodsky''': Branom's colleague and co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He seems much more passive than Branom and says considerably less.\n* '''F. Alexander''': An author who was in the process of typing his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]  ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his droogs broke into his house, beat him, tore up his work and then brutally gang-raped his wife, which caused her subsequent death. He is left deeply scarred by these events and when he encounters Alex two years later, he uses him as a guinea pig in a sadistic experiment intended to prove the Ludovico technique unsound. He is given the name Frank Alexander in the film.\n* '''Cat Woman''': An indirectly named woman who blocks Alex's gang's entrance scheme, and threatens to shoot Alex and set her [[cat]]s on him if he does not leave. After Alex breaks into her house, she fights with him, ordering her cats to join the melee, but reprimands Alex for fighting them off. She sustains a fatal blow to the head during the scuffle.

In ''Clockwork Marmalade'', an essay published in the ''[[The Listener (magazine)|Listener]]'' in 1972, he said that he had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from [[William K. Everson|William Everson]] on the television programme ''[[Camera Three]]'' in 1972, \"Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It's a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase \"as queer as a clockwork orange\" is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I have to give it an extra meaning.

To induce this conditioning, Alex is forced to watch scenes of violence on a screen that are [[Operant conditioning|systematically paired]] with negative physical stimulation. The negative physical stimulation takes the form of [[nausea]] and \"feelings of terror,\" which are caused by an [[emesis|emetic]] medicine administered just before the presentation of the films.\n\n===Use of slang===<!--\"Ultra-violence\" redirects here, please update if renamed -->\n{{Main|Nadsat}}\nThe book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang argot which Burgess invented for the book, called [[Nadsat]]. It is a mix of modified [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] words, [[rhyming slang]] and derived Russian (like ''baboochka''). For instance, these terms have the following meanings in Nadsat: ''droog'' = friend; ''moloko'' = milk; ''gulliver'' (\"golova\") = head; ''malchick'' or ''malchickiwick'' = boy; ''soomka'' = sack or bag; ''Bog'' = God; ''horrorshow'' (\"khorosho\") = good; ''prestoopnick'' = criminal; ''rooker'' (\"rooka\") = hand; ''cal'' = crap; ''veck'' (\"chelloveck\") = man or guy; ''litso'' = face; ''malenky'' = little; and so on. Some words Burgess invented himself or just adapted from pre-existing languages. Compare [[Polari]].\n\nOne of Alex's doctors explains the language to a colleague as \"odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of [[Romani people|gypsy]] talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. [[Subliminal message|Subliminal]] penetration.\" Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g. \"in-out, in-out\" or \"the old in-out\" means sexual intercourse. ''Cutter'', however, means \"money\", because \"cutter\" rhymes with \"bread-and-butter\"; this is [[rhyming slang]], which is intended to be impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen). Additionally, slang like ''appypolly loggy'' (\"apology\") seems to derive from school boy slang. This reflects Alex's age of 15.\n\nIn the first edition of the book, no key was provided, and the reader was left to interpret the meaning from the context. In his appendix to the restored edition, Burgess explained that the slang would keep the book from seeming dated, and served to muffle \"the raw response of pornography\" from the acts of violence.\n\nThe term {{anchor|Ultraviolence}}\"ultraviolence\", referring to excessive or unjustified violence, was [[Neologism|coined]] by Burgess in the book, which includes the phrase \"do the ultra-violent\". The term's association with [[Aestheticization of violence|aesthetic violence]] has led to its use in the media.<ref>{{cite news |author=AFP |title=Gruesome 'Saw 4' slashes through North American box-office |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116054923/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |archivedate=16 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Q&A With 'Hostel' Director Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino - New York Magazine |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/ |accessdate=2008-01-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080109171639/http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/| archivedate= 9 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ADV Announces New Gantz Collection, Final Guyver & More: Nov 6 Releases |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases |accessdate=2008-01-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205150753/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases| archivedate= 5 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml|title=\"Manhunt 2\": Most Violent Game Yet?, Critics Say New Video Game Is Too Realistic; Players Must Torture, Kill|date=30 October 2007|author=CBS News|accessdate=2008-01-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102153252/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml|archivedate=2 January 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Banning and censorship history in the US===\nIn 1976, ''A Clockwork Orange'' was removed from an [[Aurora, Colorado]] high school because of \"objectionable language\".

The term's association with [[Aestheticization of violence|aesthetic violence]] has led to its use in the media.<ref>{{cite news |author=AFP |title=Gruesome 'Saw 4' slashes through North American box-office |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116054923/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |archivedate=16 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Q&A With 'Hostel' Director Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino - New York Magazine |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/ |accessdate=2008-01-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080109171639/http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/| archivedate= 9 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ADV Announces New Gantz Collection, Final Guyver & More: Nov 6 Releases |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases |accessdate=2008-01-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205150753/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases| archivedate= 5 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml|title=\"Manhunt 2\": Most Violent Game Yet?, Critics Say New Video Game Is Too Realistic; Players Must Torture, Kill|date=30 October 2007|author=CBS News|accessdate=2008-01-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102153252/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml|archivedate=2 January 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Nadsat"}]}, {"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ultraviolence"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "AFP"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Gruesome 'Saw 4' slashes through North American box-office"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw"}, {"name": "date", "value": "29 October 2007"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2008-01-15"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080116054923/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "16 January 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "df", "value": "dmy-all"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Q&A With 'Hostel' Director Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino - New York Magazine"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2008-01-15"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080109171639/http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "9 January 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "ADV Announces New Gantz Collection, Final Guyver & More: Nov 6 Releases"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2008-01-15"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080205150753/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "5 February 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml"}, {"name": "title", "value": "\"Manhunt 2\": Most Violent Game Yet?, Critics Say New Video Game Is Too Realistic; Players Must Torture, Kill"}, {"name": "date", "value": "30 October 2007"}, {"name": "author", "value": "CBS News"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2008-01-15"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080102153252/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2 January 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "Banning and censorship history in the US", "paragraphs": "In 1976, ''A Clockwork Orange'' was removed from an [[Aurora, Colorado]] high school because of \"objectionable language\".

The track ''[[Hier kommt Alex]]'' became one of the band's signature songs.\n\n[[File:Alex and his droogies.jpg|thumb|[[Vanessa Claire Stewart|Vanessa Claire Smith]], Sterling Wolfe, Michael Holmes, and Ricky Coates in [[Brad Mays]]' multi-media stage production of ''A Clockwork Orange'', 2003, Los Angeles.

(photo: Peter Zuehlke)]]\nIn February 1990, another musical version was produced at the Barbican Theatre in London by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. Titled ''A Clockwork Orange: 2004'', it received mostly negative reviews, with [[John Peter (critic)|John Peter]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of London calling it \"only an intellectual ''[[Rocky Horror Show]]''\", and John Gross of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' calling it \"a clockwork lemon\". Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', he called the score, written by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]] of the rock group [[U2 (band)|U2]], \"neo-wallpaper.\" Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band's experimental mix of [[hip hop]], [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[gothic music]]. Lise Hand of ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' reported The Edge as saying that Burgess's original conception was \"a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter\". Calling it \"meaningless glitz\", Jane Edwardes of ''20/20 Magazine'' said that watching this production was \"like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant \u2013 and being served with a [[Big Mac]].\"\n\nIn 1994, Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater put on a production of ''A Clockwork Orange'' directed by [[Terry Kinney]].  The American premiere of novelist Anthony Burgess's own adaptation of his ''A Clockwork Orange'' starred [[K. Todd Freeman]] as Alex. In 2001, UNI Theatre (Mississauga, Ontario) presented the Canadian premiere of the play under the direction of Terry Costa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mirateca.com/projects/unitheatre/default.aspx |title=Mirateca Arts |publisher=Mirateca.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Godlight Theatre Company presented the New York Premiere adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at [[Manhattan Theatre Source]]. The production went on to play at the SoHo Playhouse (2002), Ensemble Studio Theatre (2004), 59E59 Theaters (2005) and the [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] (2005).
