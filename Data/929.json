'''Complementary medicine''' ('''CM'''), '''complementary and alternative medicine''' ('''CAM'''), '''integrated medicine''' or '''integrative medicine''' ('''IM'''), and '''holistic medicine''' are among many [[rebranding]]s of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside [[medical science]], and rely on [[pseudoscience]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional practices]] become \"alternative\" when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are '''new-age''' or '''pseudo''', with little distinction from [[quackery]].\n\nSome alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works; others resort to the [[supernatural]] or [[Superstition|superstitious]] to explain their effect. In others, the practice is plausibly effective but has too many [[side-effect]]s. Alternative medicine is distinct from [[experimental medicine]], which employs the [[scientific method]] to test plausible therapies by way of [[Research#Research ethics|responsible and ethical]] [[clinical trial]]s, producing [[evidence]] of either effect or of no effect. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as [[placebo]]-[[Scientific control|controlled]] trials, [[Blinded experiment|blind experiments]] and calculation of [[prior probability]]), providing invalid results.\n\nMuch of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective (the [[placebo effect]]), or from the treated condition resolving on its own ([[regression to the mean|the natural course of disease]]). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as [[cancer]] or [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]], multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. [[cyanide]] poisoning from [[amygdalin]], or the intentional ingestion of [[hydrogen peroxide]]) or actively interfere with effective treatments.\n\nThe alternative sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Its marketing often [[Appeal to nature|advertises the treatments as being \"natural\"]] or \"[[wikt:holistic|holistic]]\", in comparison to those offered by \"[[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|big pharma]]\". Billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine, with little to no positive results. Some of the successful practices are only considered alternative under very specific definitions, such as those which include all [[physical activity]] under the umbrella of \"alternative medicine\". \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "pp-protect", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "infobox alternative medicine\n", "values": [{"name": "synonyms", "value": "<!--Please do not remove any synonym without prior consensus, seek consensus on the talk page-->AM, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), complementary medicine, heterodox medicine, integrative medicine (IM), complementary and integrative medicine (CIM), new-age medicine, pseudomedicine, unconventional medicine, unorthodox medicine<!--Please do not remove any synonym without prior consensus, seek consensus on the talk page-->"}, {"name": "image_size", "value": "250"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Alternative therapies often make bombastic claims, and frequently include anecdotes from healthy-looking individuals claiming successful treatment."}, {"name": "claims", "value": "Alternatives to reality-based medical treatments"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Form of non-scientific healing"}]}, {"name": "Alternative medical systems", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "general"}]}, {"name": "TOC limit", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " Definitions and terminology ", "paragraphs": "{{see also|Terminology of alternative medicine}}\n\nThe terms ''alternative medicine'', ''complementary medicine'', ''integrative medicine,'' ''holistic medicine'', ''natural medicine'', ''unorthodox medicine'', ''fringe medicine'', ''unconventional medicine'', and ''[[new age]] medicine'' are used interchangeably as having the same meaning, and are almost synonymous in most contexts.<ref name=\"Shapiro 08\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1|title=Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All|last=Shapiro|first=Rose|date=2010-09-30|publisher=Random House |isbn=9781409059165}}</ref><ref name=\"Bombardieri2000\" /><ref name=\"Shuval2012\" /><ref name=\"Freedman2011\" /> Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners.<ref name=\"SBM-brand\">[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/integrative-medicine-a-brand-not-a-specialty/ \"Integrative medicine\": A brand, not a specialty].

These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=135 135\u201336]}}\n\nAlternative therapies do not \"complement\" (improve the effect of, or mitigate the side effects of) functional medical treatment.{{refn|group=n|name=FinalReport}}<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name=Ernst_1995/><ref name=Joyce_1994/><ref name=BMJ_May/> Significant [[drug interaction]]s caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively impact functional treatment by making [[prescription drug]]s less effective, such as interference by herbal preparations with [[warfarin]].<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Arye13\" />\n\nIn the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s.

There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].<ref name=\"Beyerstein\" /> Related to this are vigorous [[marketing]]<ref name=\"Weber\" /> of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.<ref name=\"Beyerstein\" /><ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" /> Alternative medicine is criticized for taking advantage of the least fortunate members of society.<ref name=\"ConsumerHealth9th\"/>\n\nThere is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies,<ref name=\"Li et al., 2018\" /> mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.<ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" /> Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.<ref name=\"Barnes2004\" /> Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.<ref name=\"Weber\" />\n\nPatients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative therapies to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.<ref name=\"Beyerstein\" /><ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" />\n\n===Prevalence of use===\n\nAccording to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=H\u00e9l\u00e8ne|last2=Debons|first2=J\u00e9r\u00f4me|title=CAM and conventional medicine in Switzerland : divided in theory, united in practice.

[[Traditional medicine|Traditional remedies]], often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.<ref name=\"WHO_tradmed_fact\" />\n\nSome have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.<ref name=\"Horrobin1986\" /> However, public funding for research exists. In the US increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM).

[[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. \"From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable.\"<ref name=\"Kellhear2003\" /> The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ [[mind-body intervention|mind-body]] interventions designed to \"reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life.\"<ref name=\"Menefee2005\" />\n\n=== Regulation ===\n{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}[[File:Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products (FDA October 16, 2008).djvu|thumb|Health campaign flyers, as in this example from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], warn the public about unsafe products.]]\n\nThe alternative medicine lobby has successfully pushed for alternative therapies to be subject to far less regulation than conventional medicine.<ref name=\"ConsumerHealth9th\" /> Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic]], have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world{{sfn|WHO|2005}} and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all.{{sfn|WHO|2005}} In some cases, promotion of alternative therapies is allowed when there is demonstrably no effect, only a tradition of use.

There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.<ref name=\"Colquhoun2012\"/>  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.\n\nAdvocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.<ref name=\"Connelly2012\"/> Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).<ref name=\"Malcolm2012\"/>\n\n====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====\n\nForms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.<ref name=CassilethDeng2004/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Arye13\" /> An example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor [[Alastair MacLennan (medicine)|Alastair MacLennan]] of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking \"natural\" potions to \"build up her strength\" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.<ref name=\"Hills1999\"/>\n\nTo ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:\n\n{{quote|And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.<ref name=\"SwanABC\"/>}}\n\n====Side-effects====\n\nConventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative therapies, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment&nbsp;\u2013 whether conventional or alternative&nbsp;\u2013 that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects.
