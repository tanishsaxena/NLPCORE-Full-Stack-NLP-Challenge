The third-century BC Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named \"Meni\" (or ''[[Menes]]'' in Greek) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 6</ref>\n[[File:NarmerPalette ROM-gamma.jpg|thumb|The [[Narmer Palette]] depicts the unification\nof the Two Lands.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 32</ref>]]\nThe transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the king [[Narmer]], who is depicted wearing [[Regalia|royal regalia]] on the ceremonial ''Narmer Palette,'' in a symbolic act of unification.<ref>Clayton (1994) pp. 12\u201313</ref> In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000&nbsp;BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], from which he could control the [[labour force]] and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical [[trade route]]s to the [[Levant]]. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate [[mastaba]] tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 70</ref> The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080304143847/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html| archivedate= 4 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC)===\n{{Main|Old Kingdom of Egypt}}\nMajor advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the [[Old Kingdom]], fueled by the increased [[agricultural productivity]] and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.<ref>James (2005) p. 40</ref> Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve [[crop yield]], drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a [[Criminal law|justice system]] to maintain peace and order.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 102</ref> [[File:Khafre statue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khafre]] Enthroned]]\n\nWith the rising importance of central administration in Egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services. Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.<ref>Shaw (2002) pp. 116\u201317</ref> As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king.

Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer\u2014which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 120</ref> In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the [[optimism]] and originality of the period.<ref name=\"Shaw146\">Shaw (2002) p. 146</ref>\n\nFree from their loyalties to the king, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and [[political power]]. By 2160&nbsp;BC, rulers in [[Herakleopolis]] controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the [[Intef I|Intef family]], took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055&nbsp;BC the northern Theban forces under [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 29</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)===\n{{Main|Middle Kingdom of Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Egypte louvre 231 visage.jpg|thumb|upright|Amenemhat III, the last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom]]\n\nThe kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's stability and prosperity, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 148</ref> Mentuhotep II and his [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier [[Amenemhat I]], upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] around 1985&nbsp;BC, shifted the kingdom's capital to the city of [[Itjtawy]], located in [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 79</ref> From Itjtawy, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted [[land reclamation]] and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in [[Nubia]] that was rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the \"[[Walls-of-the-Ruler]]\", to defend against foreign attack.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 158</ref>\n\nWith the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.<ref>Shaw (2002) pp. 179\u201382</ref> Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style.<ref name=\"Shaw146\"/> The [[relief]] and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 90</ref>\n\nThe last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, [[Amenemhat III]], allowed [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking [[Canaan]]ite settlers from the [[Near East]] into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the [[Canaan]]ite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the [[Hyksos]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 188</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period (1674\u20131549 BC) and the Hyksos===\n{{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}}\n[[File:Egypt NK edit.svg|upright|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of ancient Egypt (15th century BC)]]\nAround 1785&nbsp;BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened, a [[Western Asia]]n people called the [[Hyksos]], who had already settled in the Delta, seized control of Egypt and established their capital at [[Avaris]], forcing the former central government to retreat to Thebes. The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.<ref name=\"Ryholt310\">Ryholt (1997) p. 310</ref> The Hyksos (\"foreign rulers\") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings, thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture.

That task fell to Kamose's successor, [[Ahmose I]], who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty and, in the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the kings, who sought to expand Egypt's borders and attempted to gain mastery of the [[Near East]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 224</ref>\n\n===New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)===\n{{Main|New Kingdom of Egypt}}\n\nThe New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the [[Mitanni]] Empire, [[Assyria]], and [[Canaan]]. Military campaigns waged under [[Thutmose I|Tuthmosis I]] and his grandson [[Thutmose III|Tuthmosis III]] extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.

The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|temple of Amun]] in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.<ref>James (2005) p. 54</ref>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013653 BC)===\n{{Main|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}\n\nFollowing the death of [[Ramesses XI]] in 1078 BC, [[Smendes]] assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]]. The south was effectively controlled by the [[Theban High Priests of Amun (21st and 22nd Dynasty)|High Priests of Amun at Thebes]], who recognized Smendes in name only.<ref>Cerny (1975) p. 645</ref> During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under [[Shoshenq I]] in 945 BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200&nbsp;years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]], and [[Cushi|Kushites]] threatened from the south. Around 727&nbsp;BC the Kushite king [[Piye]] invaded northward, seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 345</ref>\n\nEgypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the [[Assyria]]n sphere of influence, and by 700&nbsp;BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667&nbsp;BC the Assyrians began their attack on Egypt. The reigns of both [[Taharqa]] and his successor, [[Tantamani|Tanutamun]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories. Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and [[Sack of Thebes|sacked the temples of Thebes]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 358</ref>\n\n===Late Period (672\u2013332 BC)===\n{{Main|Late Period of ancient Egypt|History of Achaemenid Egypt}}\n\nThe Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Sixth Dynasty]]. By 653&nbsp;BC, the Saite king [[Psamtik I]] was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek influence]] expanded greatly as the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Naucratis|Naukratis]] became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525&nbsp;BC, the powerful Persians, led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the battle of [[Pelusium]]. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 383</ref>\n\nFollowing its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with [[Cyprus]] and [[Phoenicia]] in the sixth [[satrap]]y of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh dynasty, ended in 402&nbsp;BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties, the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]], proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of [[Nectanebo II]]. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the [[Achaemenid Empire|Thirty-First Dynasty]], began in 343&nbsp;BC, but shortly after, in 332&nbsp;BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to [[Alexander the Great]] without a fight.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 385</ref>\n\n===Ptolemaic period (332\u201330 BC)===\n{{Main|History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Alexander the Great, 100 B.C.E. \u2013 100 C.E., 54.162.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Alexander the Great]], 100&nbsp;BC \u2013 100&nbsp;AD, 54.162, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn 332&nbsp;BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt with little resistance from the [[Persia]]ns and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Alexandria]]. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a [[Seat of Wisdom|seat of learning]] and culture, centered at the famous [[Library of Alexandria]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 405</ref> The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city\u2014as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 411</ref>\n\n[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian gods]] were [[Syncretic religion|syncretized]] into composite deities, such as [[Serapis]], and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 418</ref> In addition, as [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful opponents from the [[Near East]] made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.<ref>James (2005) p. 62</ref>\n\n===Roman period (30 BC\u2013641 AD)===\n{{Main|Egypt (Roman province)}}\n\n[[File:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|The [[Fayum mummy portraits]] epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures.]]\n\nEgypt became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30&nbsp;BC, following the defeat of [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] by [[Octavian]] (later [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] Augustus) in the [[Battle of Actium]]. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the [[Roman legion|Roman army]], under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.<ref>James (2005) p. 63</ref> Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 426</ref>\n\nAlthough the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.<ref name=\"Shaw422\">Shaw (2002) p. 422</ref> The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.<ref name=\"Shaw422\"/>\n\nFrom the mid-first century AD, [[Christianity]] took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian Religion]] and [[Greco-Roman]] religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of [[Diocletian]] starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.<ref>Shaw (2003) p. 431</ref> In 391 the Christian Emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.<ref>\"''The Church in Ancient Society''\", [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], p. 373, Oxford University Press US, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-924695-5}}</ref> Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.<ref>\"''Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D 100\u2013400\"'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]], p. 63, Yale University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-300-03216-1}}</ref> As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak [[Egyptian language|their language]], the ability to read [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to [[church (building)|churches]] or abandoned to the desert.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 445</ref>\n\nIn the fourth century, as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt found itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian Persian]] army (618\u2013628 AD), was recaptured by the Roman Emperor [[Heraclius]] (629\u2013639 AD), and then was finally captured by [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Rashidun army]] in 639\u2013641 AD, ending Roman rule.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ancient Egyptian

Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Cleopatra VII]] even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as [[God's Wife of Amun|Divine Wives of Amun]]. Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, served only secondary roles in the temples, and were not as likely to be as educated as men.<ref name=UCJohnson/> <!--- Moved reference about women and gender equality down to External Links -RoyGoldsmith, 4/9/12 --->\n\n===Legal system===\n[[File:Louvre-antiquites-egyptiennes-p1020372 Cropped and bg reduced.png|thumb|left|upright|[[The Seated Scribe]] from [[Saqqara]], [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]]; scribes were elite and well educated.

Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.<ref>Oakes (2003) p. 472</ref>\n\nPunishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.<ref name=\"Manuelian358\"/> Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[oracle]]s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \"yes\" or \"no\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an [[ostracon]].<ref>McDowell (1999) p. 168</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian agriculture}} {{see also|Ancient Egyptian cuisine|Gardens of ancient Egypt}}\n[[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields, harvesting the crops, and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer, painting in the tomb of [[TT52|Nakht]].]]\n[[File:Measure and Harvest005.jpg|thumb|left|Measuring and recording the harvest is shown in a wall painting in the tomb of [[TT69|Menna]], at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (Eighteenth Dynasty).]]\n\nA combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich [[fertile soil]] resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 361</ref>\n\nFarming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''Akhet'' (flooding), ''Peret'' (planting), and ''Shemu'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 514</ref> From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain. [[Winnowing]] removed the [[chaff]] from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 506</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians cultivated [[emmer]] and [[barley]], and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 510</ref> [[Flax]] plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.<ref>Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630</ref>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food.]]\nThe Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and [[animal]]s was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.<ref name=\"Strouhal117\">Strouhal (1989) p. 117</ref> Animals, both [[Domestication|domesticated]] and [[Wildlife|wild]], were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. [[Poultry]], such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.<ref name=\"Manuelian381\">Manuelian (1998) p. 381</ref> The Nile provided a plentiful source of [[fish]].

There were extensive [[Gold mining|gold mines]] in [[Nubia]], and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The [[Wadi Hammamat]] was a notable source of granite, [[greywacke]], and gold. [[Flint]] was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 28</ref> Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as [[sulfur]] as cosmetic substances.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 361</ref>\n\nFarming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''Akhet'' (flooding), ''Peret'' (planting), and ''Shemu'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 514</ref> From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain.

These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand.

Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures.

The [[Narmer Palette]], for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 21</ref> Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.<ref>Robins (2001) p. 12</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with [[gum arabic]] as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 105</ref>\n\nPharaohs used [[relief]]s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes.

The Egyptian pantheon was populated by [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Egyptian mythology|myths]] and stories into a coherent system.<ref>James (2005) p. 102</ref> These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.<ref>\"''The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology''\", edited by [[Donald B.

At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.<ref>James (2005) p. 117</ref> After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.<ref name=\"Shaw313\">Shaw (2002) p. 313</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''\u0161wt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.<ref>Allen (2000) pp. 79, 94\u201395</ref> The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the \"blessed dead\", living on as an ''akh'', or \"effective one\". For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a \"[[Maat#The afterlife|feather of truth]].\" If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.<ref>Wasserman, ''et al.'' (1994) pp. 150\u201353</ref>\n\n===Burial customs===\n<!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' -->\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}\n[[File:Anubis attending the mummy of Sennedjem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anubis]] was the ancient Egyptian god associated with mummification and burial rituals; here, he attends to a mummy.]]\n\nThe ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by [[Mummy|mummification]], performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.<ref name=\"James122\"/> Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by [[desiccation]]. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in [[canopic jar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/ok.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Old Kingdom|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}</ref>\n\nBy the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called [[natron]]. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Late Period, Ptolemaic, Roman and Christian Period |accessdate=9 March 2008 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080330041612/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html| archivedate= 30 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased.

Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from [[animal fat]] and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 405</ref> Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and [[Beauty and Cosmetics in Ancient Egypt|cosmetics]].

The Egyptian pantheon was populated by [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Egyptian mythology|myths]] and stories into a coherent system.<ref>James (2005) p. 102</ref> These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.<ref>\"''The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology''\", edited by [[Donald B.

At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.<ref>James (2005) p. 117</ref> After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.<ref name=\"Shaw313\">Shaw (2002) p. 313</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''\u0161wt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.<ref>Allen (2000) pp. 79, 94\u201395</ref> The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the \"blessed dead\", living on as an ''akh'', or \"effective one\". For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a \"[[Maat#The afterlife|feather of truth]].\" If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.<ref>Wasserman, ''et al.''

These customs involved preserving the body by [[Mummy|mummification]], performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.<ref name=\"James122\"/> Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by [[desiccation]]. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in [[canopic jar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/ok.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Old Kingdom|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}</ref>\n\nBy the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called [[natron]]. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Late Period, Ptolemaic, Roman and Christian Period |accessdate=9 March 2008 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080330041612/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html| archivedate= 30 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased.

The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of [[Buhen]] on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the [[Levant]].

Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], small amounts of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] and [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and a colorant, typically copper.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 177</ref> The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as [[Egyptian blue|Egyptian Blue]], also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or [[sintering]]) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 109</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 195</ref> It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding [[Micromineral|trace elements]] to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 215</ref>\n\n===Medicine===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}\nThe medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from [[malaria]] and debilitating [[schistosomiasis]] parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to [[abscess]]es (though [[dental caries|caries]] were rare).<ref>Filer (1995) p. 94</ref>\n\nThe diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted [[Periodontitis|periodontal disease]].<ref>Filer (1995) pp. 78\u201380</ref> Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.<ref>Filer (1995) p. 21</ref> Adult [[life expectancy]] was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.<ref>Figures are given for ''adult'' life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy ''at birth.''

[[Napoleon]], for example, arranged the first studies in [[Egyptology]] when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's [[natural history]], which was published in the ''[[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]''.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 100</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:The Sphinx and Pyramid of Khafre (8838365561).jpg|Tourists at the [[Pyramid of Khafre|pyramid complex of Khafre]] near the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]]\nFile:EgyptFrontispiece.jpg|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of ''[[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]'', published in 38 volumes between 1809 and 1829.\n</gallery>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Egyptian Revival architecture"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Tourism in Egypt"}]}], "id": 41}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "{{Portal-inline|Ancient Egypt}}\n* [[Glossary of ancient Egypt artifacts]]\n* [[Index of ancient Egypt-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n* [[List of ancient Egyptians]]\n{{clear}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Portal-inline", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Ancient Egypt"}]}], "id": 42}, {"title": "Notes", "paragraphs": "{{Reflist|22em}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Reflist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "22em"}]}], "id": 43}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |author=Aldred, Cyril |title=Akhenaten, King of Egypt |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=978-0-500-05048-4 |doi=}}\n* {{Cite book |author=Allen, James P. |title=Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-77483-3}}\n* {{Cite book | last=Badawy | first=Alexander | title=A History of Egyptian Architecture.
