In this sense, the electrons have the following properties:\n\n'''Wave-like properties:'''\n# The electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the manner of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as  [[standing wave]]s. Thus the lowest possible energy an electron can take is similar to the  [[fundamental frequency]] of a wave on a string. Higher energy states are similar to [[harmonics]] of that fundamental frequency.\n# The electrons are never in a single point location, although the probability of interacting with the electron at a single point can be found from the wave function of the electron.  The charge on the electron acts like it is smeared out in space in a continuous distribution, proportional at any point to the squared magnitude of the electron's [[wave function]].\n\n'''Particle-like properties:'''\n# The number of electrons orbiting the nucleus can only be an integer.\n# Electrons jump between orbitals like particles. For example, if a single [[photon]] strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon.\n# The electrons retain particle-like properties such as: each wave state has the same electrical charge as its electron particle. Each wave state has a single discrete spin (spin up or spin down) depending on its [[Quantum superposition|superposition]].\n\nThus, despite the popular analogy to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles. In addition, atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms. A more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly shaped \"atmosphere\" (the electron), distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the atomic nucleus). Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this \"atmosphere\" only when a single electron is present in an atom. When more electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection (sometimes termed the atom's \"electron cloud\"<ref>{{cite book| title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics -The Definitive Edition, Vol 1 lect 6| page=11| year=2006| publisher= Pearson PLC, Addison Wesley|isbn =978-0-8053-9046-9|last1= Feynman|first1= Richard|last2= Leighton|first2=Robert B.|first3=Matthew|last3=Sands}}</ref>) tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing the electron's location, because of the [[uncertainty principle]].\n\n=== Formal quantum mechanical definition ===\nAtomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] language. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e., an [[eigenstate]] of the atomic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], is approximated by an expansion (see [[configuration interaction]] expansion and [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]) into [[linear combination]]s of anti-symmetrized products ([[Slater determinant]]s) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called atomic orbitals. (When one considers also their [[spin (physics)|spin]] component, one speaks of '''atomic spin orbitals'''.) A state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated by this [[Nuclear structure#The independent-particle model|independent-particle model]] of products of single electron wave functions.<ref>[[Roger Penrose]], ''[[The Road to Reality]]''</ref> (The [[London dispersion force]], for example, depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons.)\n\nIn [[atomic physics]], the [[atomic spectral line]]s correspond to transitions ([[Atomic electron transition|quantum leaps]]) between [[quantum state]]s of an atom. These states are labeled by a set of [[quantum number]]s summarized in the [[term symbol]] and usually associated with particular electron configurations, i.e., by occupation schemes of atomic orbitals (for example, 1s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;2s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;2p<sup>6</sup> for the ground state of [[neon]]-term symbol: <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub>).\n\nThis notation means that the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the [[configuration interaction]] expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given [[Atomic electron transition|transition]]. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that electrons are [[fermion]]s ruled by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and cannot be distinguished from each other. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when [[electron correlation]] is large.\n\nFundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wave function, even though most electrons do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital visualization heavily influenced by the [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] approximation, which is one way to reduce the complexities of [[molecular orbital theory]].\n\n=== Types of orbitals ===\n[[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spdf m0.png|thumb|upright=1.5|3D views of some [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like]] atomic orbitals showing probability density and phase ('''g''' orbitals and higher are not shown)]]\nAtomic orbitals can be the hydrogen-like \"orbitals\" which are exact solutions to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for a [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like \"atom\"]] (i.e., an atom with one electron). Alternatively, atomic orbitals refer to functions that depend on the coordinates of one electron (i.e., orbitals) but are used as starting points for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of all the electrons in an atom or molecule. The [[coordinate system]]s chosen for atomic orbitals are usually [[spherical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} in atoms and [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesians]] {{math|(x,\u2009y,\u2009z)}} in polyatomic molecules.

It became clear from his analysis in 1911 that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic structure. In 1913 as Rutherford's post-doctoral student, [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a new model of the atom, wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods, but were only permitted to have discrete values of angular momentum, quantized in units [[reduced Planck constant|''h''/2\u03c0]].<ref name=\"Bohr 1913 476\" /> This constraint automatically permitted only certain values of electron energies. The [[Bohr model]] of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground state (by declaring that there was no state below this), and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines.\n\n[[File:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|The [[Bohr model|Rutherford\u2013Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom.]]\nAfter Bohr's use of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the [[Emission spectra|emission]] and [[absorption spectra]] of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the Bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom. This was, however, ''not'' achieved by Bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave-like properties, since the idea that electrons could behave as [[matter waves]] was not suggested until eleven years later. Still, the Bohr model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and also a significant step towards the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms.\n\nWith [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie]]'s suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924, and for a short time before the full 1926 [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] treatment of [[hydrogen-like atom]], a Bohr electron \"wavelength\" could be seen to be a function of its momentum, and thus a Bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half-wavelength (this physically incorrect Bohr model is still often taught to beginning students). The Bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the Bohr model was proposed.\n\nThe Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[hydrogen]]. The energies of electrons in the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such as the fact that [[helium]] (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and [[argon]] (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern [[quantum mechanics]] explains this in terms of [[electron shell]]s and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Thus the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the ''n'' = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 states are fully occupied; the same is true for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 in neon. In argon, the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.\n\n=== Modern conceptions and connections to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ===\nImmediately after [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] discovered his [[uncertainty principle]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heisenberg| first=W.|title=\u00dcber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik A]] |date=March 1927| volume=43 | pages=172\u2013198|doi=10.1007/BF01397280|bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H| issue=3\u20134}}</ref> [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] noted that the existence of any sort of [[wave packet]] implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bohr | first=Niels| title=The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory|journal=Nature |date=April 1928| volume=121 | pages=580\u2013590|doi=10.1038/121580a0 |bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B| issue=3050 }}</ref> In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.\n\nIn chemistry, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]], [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]], [[Robert S. Mulliken|Mulliken]] and others noted that the consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. [[Max Born]] suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a [[probability distribution]] which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom.\n\nIn the quantum picture of Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger and others, the Bohr atom number&nbsp;''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere''{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Atomic theory"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Mulliken"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Robert S."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Electronic Structures of Polyatomic Molecules and Valence.

Still, the Bohr model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and also a significant step towards the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms.\n\nWith [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie]]'s suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924, and for a short time before the full 1926 [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] treatment of [[hydrogen-like atom]], a Bohr electron \"wavelength\" could be seen to be a function of its momentum, and thus a Bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half-wavelength (this physically incorrect Bohr model is still often taught to beginning students). The Bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the Bohr model was proposed.\n\nThe Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[hydrogen]]. The energies of electrons in the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such as the fact that [[helium]] (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and [[argon]] (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern [[quantum mechanics]] explains this in terms of [[electron shell]]s and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Thus the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the ''n'' = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 states are fully occupied; the same is true for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 in neon. In argon, the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 6}, {"title": " Modern conceptions and connections to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ", "paragraphs": "Immediately after [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] discovered his [[uncertainty principle]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heisenberg| first=W.|title=\u00dcber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik A]] |date=March 1927| volume=43 | pages=172\u2013198|doi=10.1007/BF01397280|bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H| issue=3\u20134}}</ref> [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] noted that the existence of any sort of [[wave packet]] implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bohr | first=Niels| title=The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory|journal=Nature |date=April 1928| volume=121 | pages=580\u2013590|doi=10.1038/121580a0 |bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B| issue=3050 }}</ref> In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.\n\nIn chemistry, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]], [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]], [[Robert S. Mulliken|Mulliken]] and others noted that the consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. [[Max Born]] suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a [[probability distribution]] which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom.\n\nIn the quantum picture of Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger and others, the Bohr atom number&nbsp;''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere''{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Heisenberg"}, {"name": "first", "value": "W."}, {"name": "title", "value": "\u00dcber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik A]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "March 1927"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "43"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "172\u2013198"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1007/BF01397280"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1927ZPhy...43..172H"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "3\u20134"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Bohr"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Niels"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Nature"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 1928"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "121"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "580\u2013590"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1038/121580a0"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1928Natur.121..580B"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "3050"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "January 2013"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": " Orbital names ", "paragraphs": "===Orbital notation===\nOrbitals have been given names, which are usually given in the form:\n:<math>X \\, \\mathrm{type}^y \\ </math>\nwhere ''X'' is the energy level corresponding to the [[principal quantum number]] {{mvar|n}}; '''type''' is a lower-case letter denoting the shape or [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshell]] of the orbital, corresponding to the [[angular quantum number]]&nbsp;{{mvar|\u2113}}; and {{mvar|y}} is the number of electrons in that orbital.\n\nFor example, the orbital 1s<sup>2</sup> (pronounced as the individual numbers and letters: \"'one' 'ess' 'two'\") has two electrons and is the lowest energy level ({{math|1=''n'' = 1}}) and has an angular quantum number of {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}, denoted as s.\n\n===X-ray notation===\n{{main|X-ray notation}}\nThere is also another, less common system still used in X-ray science known as [[X-ray notation]], which is a continuation of the notations used before orbital theory was well understood.

An atom of any other element [[ion]]ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian operator]] for the energy. They can be obtained analytically, meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see [[hydrogen atom]]).\n\nFor atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation. Orbitals of multi-electron atoms are ''qualitatively'' similar to those of hydrogen, and in the simplest models, they are taken to have the same form. For more rigorous and precise analysis, numerical approximations must be used.\n\nA given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers: [[Principal quantum number|{{mvar|n|size=120%}}]], [[Azimuthal quantum number|{{mvar|\u2113|size=120%}}]], and [[magnetic quantum number|{{mvar|m<sub>\u2113</sub>|size=120%}}]].

Electron states are best represented by time-depending \"mixtures\" ([[linear combination]]s) of multiple orbitals. See [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]].\n\nThe quantum number {{mvar|n}} first appeared in the [[Bohr model]] where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, {{mvar|n}} determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of ''n'' lie at the same average distance. For this reason, orbitals with the same value of ''n'' are said to comprise a \"[[electron shell|shell]]\".

These quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values, and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex versions of the atomic orbitals are employed.\n\n=== Complex orbitals ===\nIn physics, the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom, where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic. The quantum numbers, together with the rules governing their possible values, are as follows:\n\nThe [[principal quantum number]] {{mvar|n}} describes the energy of the electron and is always a [[positive integer]]. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of ''n''; these orbitals together are sometimes called ''[[electron shells]]''.\n\nThe [[azimuthal quantum number]] {{mvar|\u2113}} describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where {{mvar|n}} is some integer {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{mvar|\u2113}} ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation <math>0 \\le \\ell \\le n_0-1</math>. For instance, the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}&nbsp;shell has only orbitals with <math>\\ell=0</math>, and the {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}&nbsp;shell has only orbitals with <math>\\ell=0</math>, and <math>\\ell=1</math>. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of&nbsp;{{mvar|\u2113}} are sometimes collectively called a ''subshell''.\n\nThe [[magnetic quantum number]], <math>m_\\ell</math>, describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where <math>\\ell</math> is some integer <math>\\ell_0</math>, <math>m_\\ell</math> ranges thus: <math>-\\ell_0 \\le m_\\ell \\le \\ell_0</math>.\n\nThe above results may be summarized in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell, and lists the values of <math>m_\\ell</math> available in that subshell.

For instance, one may speak of the subshell with <math>n=2</math> and <math>\\ell=0</math> as a '2s subshell'.\n\nEach electron also has a [[spin quantum number]], ''s'', which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The number ''s'' can be +{{sfrac|1|2}} or \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\nThe [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of all four quantum numbers. If there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three quantum numbers, ({{mvar|n}}, {{mvar|\u2113}}, {{mvar|m}}), these two electrons must differ in their spin.\n\nThe above conventions imply a preferred axis (for example, the ''z'' direction in Cartesian coordinates), and they also imply a preferred direction along this preferred axis. Otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing {{math|1=''m'' = +1}} from {{math|1=''m'' = \u22121}}. As such, the model is most useful when applied to physical systems that share these symmetries.

Complex orbitals ", "paragraphs": "In physics, the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom, where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic. The quantum numbers, together with the rules governing their possible values, are as follows:\n\nThe [[principal quantum number]] {{mvar|n}} describes the energy of the electron and is always a [[positive integer]]. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of ''n''; these orbitals together are sometimes called ''[[electron shells]]''.\n\nThe [[azimuthal quantum number]] {{mvar|\u2113}} describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where {{mvar|n}} is some integer {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{mvar|\u2113}} ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation <math>0 \\le \\ell \\le n_0-1</math>. For instance, the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}&nbsp;shell has only orbitals with <math>\\ell=0</math>, and the {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}&nbsp;shell has only orbitals with <math>\\ell=0</math>, and <math>\\ell=1</math>. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of&nbsp;{{mvar|\u2113}} are sometimes collectively called a ''subshell''.\n\nThe [[magnetic quantum number]], <math>m_\\ell</math>, describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where <math>\\ell</math> is some integer <math>\\ell_0</math>, <math>m_\\ell</math> ranges thus: <math>-\\ell_0 \\le m_\\ell \\le \\ell_0</math>.\n\nThe above results may be summarized in the following table.

The number ''s'' can be +{{sfrac|1|2}} or \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\nThe [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of all four quantum numbers. If there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three quantum numbers, ({{mvar|n}}, {{mvar|\u2113}}, {{mvar|m}}), these two electrons must differ in their spin.\n\nThe above conventions imply a preferred axis (for example, the ''z'' direction in Cartesian coordinates), and they also imply a preferred direction along this preferred axis. Otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing {{math|1=''m'' = +1}} from {{math|1=''m'' = \u22121}}.

The diagrams cannot show the entire region where an electron can be found, since according to quantum mechanics there is a non-zero probability of finding the electron (almost) anywhere in space. Instead the diagrams are approximate representations of boundary or [[contour line|contour surfaces]] where the probability density {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} has a constant value, chosen so that there is a certain probability (for example 90%) of finding the electron within the contour. Although {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} as the square of an [[absolute value]] is everywhere non-negative, the sign of the [[wave function]] {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} is often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture.\n\nSometimes the {{math|\u03c8}} function will be graphed to show its phases, rather than the {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} which shows probability density but has no phases (which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value, since {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} is a complex number). {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} orbital graphs tend to have less spherical, thinner lobes than {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} graphs, but have the same number of lobes in the same places, and otherwise are recognizable. This article, in order to show wave function phases, shows mostly {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} graphs.\n\nThe lobes can be viewed as [[standing wave]] [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns between the two counter rotating, ring resonant [[travelling wave]] \"{{mvar|m}}\" and \"{{math|\u2212''m''}}\" modes, with the projection of the orbital onto the xy plane having a resonant \"{{mvar|m}}\" wavelengths around the circumference. Though rarely depicted the travelling wave solutions can be viewed as rotating banded tori, with the bands representing phase information. For each {{mvar|m}} there are two standing wave solutions {{math|\u27e8''m''\u27e9+\u27e8\u2212''m''\u27e9}} and {{math|\u27e8''m''\u27e9\u2212\u27e8\u2212''m''\u27e9}}. For the case where {{math|1=''m'' = 0}} the orbital is vertical, counter rotating information is unknown, and the orbital is ''z''-axis symmetric. For the case where {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}} there are no counter rotating modes.  There are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric. For any given {{mvar|n}}, the smaller {{mvar|\u2113}} is, the more radial nodes there are. For any given {{mvar|\u2113}}, the smaller {{mvar|n}} is, the fewer radial nodes there are (zero for whichever {{mvar|n}} first has that {{mvar|\u2113}} orbital). Loosely speaking {{mvar|n}} is energy, {{mvar|\u2113}} is analogous to [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and {{mvar|m}} is orientation.  In the classical case, a ring resonant travelling wave, for example in a circular transmission line, unless actively forced, will spontaneously decay into a ring resonant standing wave because reflections will build up over time at even the smallest imperfection or discontinuity.\n\nGenerally speaking, the number {{mvar|n}} determines the size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus: as {{mvar|n}} increases, the size of the orbital increases. When comparing different elements, the higher nuclear charge {{mvar|Z}} of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones, so that the overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant, even as the number of electrons in heavier elements (higher {{mvar|Z}}) increases.\n[[File:Sr core-electron orbitals for Wiki.jpg|thumb|Experimentally imaged 1s and 2p core-electron orbitals of Sr, including the effects of atomic thermal vibrations and excitation broadening, retrieved from energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).<ref name=\"Jeong 165140\">{{Cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Jong Seok|last2=Odlyzko|first2=Michael L.|last3=Xu|first3=Peng|last4=Jalan|first4=Bharat|last5=Mkhoyan|first5=K.

However, since some orbitals are described by equations in [[complex number]]s, the shape sometimes depends on {{mvar|m<sub>\u2113</sub>}} also. Together, the whole set of orbitals for a given {{mvar|\u2113}} and {{mvar|n}} fill space as symmetrically as possible, though with increasingly complex sets of lobes and nodes.\n\nThe single s-orbitals (<math>\\ell=0</math>) are shaped like spheres. For {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} it is roughly a [[ball (mathematics)|solid ball]] (it is most dense at the center and fades exponentially outwardly), but for {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the \"wave-structure\" is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all {{mvar|n}} numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) at the center of the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node ''at'' the nucleus). Recently, there has been an effort to experimentally image the 1s and 2p orbitals in a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> crystal using scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.<ref name=\"Jeong 165140\" /> Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam, Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).\n\nThe shapes of p, d and f-orbitals are described verbally here and shown graphically in the ''Orbitals table'' below. The three p-orbitals for {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} have the form of two [[ellipsoid]]s with a [[point of tangency]] at the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (the two-lobed shape is sometimes referred to as a \"[[dumbbell]]\"\u2014there are two lobes pointing in opposite directions from each other). The three p-orbitals in each [[Electron shell|shell]] are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their respective linear combination of values of&nbsp;{{mvar|m<sub>\u2113</sub>}}. The overall result is a lobe pointing along each direction of the primary axes.\n\nFour of the five d-orbitals for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} look similar, each with four pear-shaped lobes, each lobe tangent at right angles to two others, and the centers of all four lying in one plane. Three of these planes are the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes\u2014the lobes are between the pairs of primary axes\u2014and the fourth has the centres along the x and y axes themselves. The fifth and final d-orbital consists of three regions of high probability density: a [[torus]] with two pear-shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis. The overall total of 18 directional lobes point in every primary axis direction and between every pair.\n\nThere are seven f-orbitals, each with shapes more complex than those of the d-orbitals.\n\nAdditionally, as is the case with the s orbitals, individual p, d, f and g orbitals with {{mvar|n}} values higher than the lowest possible value, exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type, as compared with the lowest (or fundamental) mode of the wave. As with s orbitals, this phenomenon provides p, d, f, and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of {{mvar|n}} (for example, 3p orbitals vs. the fundamental 2p), an additional node in each lobe. Still higher values of {{mvar|n}} further increase the number of radial nodes, for each type of orbital.\n\nThe shapes of atomic orbitals in one-electron atom are related to 3-dimensional [[spherical harmonics]]. These shapes are not unique, and any linear combination is valid, like a transformation to [[cubic harmonic]]s, in fact it is possible to generate sets where all the d's are the same shape, just like the {{math|p<sub>''x''</sub>, p<sub>''y''</sub>,}} and {{math|p<sub>''z''</sub>}} are the same shape.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ed045p45 | title = The five equivalent d orbitals | year = 1968 | last1 = Powell | first1 = Richard E. | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 45| issue = 1 | page = 45|bibcode = 1968JChEd..45...45P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| doi =10.1063/1.1750628 | title =Directed Valence | year =1940 | last1 =Kimball | first1 =George E. | journal =The Journal of Chemical Physics | volume =8| issue =2 | page =188|bibcode = 1940JChPh...8..188K }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Schrodinger model of the atom.svg|thumb|The 1s, 2s, & 2p orbitals of a sodium atom.]]\nAlthough individual orbitals are most often shown independent of each other, the orbitals coexist around the nucleus at the same time. Also, in 1927, [[Albrecht Uns\u00f6ld]] proved that if one sums the electron density of all orbitals of a particular azimuthal quantum number  {{mvar|\u2113}} of the same shell {{mvar|n}} (e.g. all three 2p orbitals, or all five 3d orbitals) where each orbital is occupied by an electron or each is occupied by an electron pair, then all angular dependence disappears; that is, the resulting total density of all the atomic orbitals in that subshell (those with the same  {{mvar|\u2113}}) is spherical.

L.}}</ref> To see the analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane velocity and momentum at that point) must be considered relative to that point's distance from the center of the drum head. If this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals. The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electron's average momentum at that point, since high electron momentum at a given position tends to \"localize\" the electron in that position, via the properties of electron wave-packets (see the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for details of the mechanism).\n\nThis relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the [[antinode]] in all '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.\n\nA mental \"planetary orbit\" picture closest to the behavior of electrons in '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals, all of which have no angular momentum, might perhaps be that of a [[Keplerian orbit]] with the [[orbital eccentricity]] of 1 but a finite major axis, not physically possible (because [[particle]]s were to collide), but can be imagined as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity.<!-- could somebody make an illustration? -->\n\nBelow, a number of drum membrane vibration modes and the respective wave functions of the hydrogen atom are shown. A correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two-coordinate system {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8)}} and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three-coordinate {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}}.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"s-type drum modes and wave functions\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode01.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{01}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode02.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{02}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode03.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{03}</math>\nFile:Phi 1s.gif|Wave function of 1s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=2 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 2s.gif|Wave function of 2s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=10 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 3s.gif|Wave function of 3s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=20 a_0</math>)\n</gallery>\n\nNone of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode, and in all of them the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-'''s''' orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.\n\nIn addition, the drum modes analogous to '''p''' and '''d''' modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to '''s'''&nbsp;modes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-'''s''' orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"p-type drum modes and wave functions\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode11.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{11}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode12.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{12}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode13.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{13}</math>\nFile:Phi 2p.gif|Wave function of 2p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=10 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 3p.gif|Wave function of 3p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=20 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 4p.gif|Wave function of 4p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=25 a_0</math>)\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"d-type drum modes\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode21.gif|Mode <math>u_{21}</math> (3d orbital)\nFile:Drum vibration mode22.gif|Mode <math>u_{22}</math> (4d orbital)\nFile:Drum vibration mode23.gif|Mode <math>u_{23}</math> (5d orbital)\n</gallery>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "(''n'' = 6, ''\u2113'' = 0, ''m'' = 0)"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''n'' > 1"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{!}}\u2009\u03c8\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c8"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u2212''m''"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u27e8''m''\u27e9+\u27e8\u2212''m''\u27e9"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u27e8''m''\u27e9\u2212\u27e8\u2212''m''\u27e9"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''m'' = 0"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''\u2113'' = 0"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u2113"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u2113"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u2113"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u2113"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Z"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Z"}]}, {"name": "Cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Jeong"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Jong Seok"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Odlyzko"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Michael L."}, {"name": "last3", "value": "Xu"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Peng"}, {"name": "last4", "value": "Jalan"}, {"name": "first4", "value": "Bharat"}, {"name": "last5", "value": "Mkhoyan"}, {"name": "first5", "value": "K.

L.}}</ref> To see the analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane velocity and momentum at that point) must be considered relative to that point's distance from the center of the drum head. If this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals. The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electron's average momentum at that point, since high electron momentum at a given position tends to \"localize\" the electron in that position, via the properties of electron wave-packets (see the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for details of the mechanism).\n\nThis relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the [[antinode]] in all '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.\n\nA mental \"planetary orbit\" picture closest to the behavior of electrons in '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals, all of which have no angular momentum, might perhaps be that of a [[Keplerian orbit]] with the [[orbital eccentricity]] of 1 but a finite major axis, not physically possible (because [[particle]]s were to collide), but can be imagined as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity.<!-- could somebody make an illustration? -->\n\nBelow, a number of drum membrane vibration modes and the respective wave functions of the hydrogen atom are shown. A correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two-coordinate system {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8)}} and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three-coordinate {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}}.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"s-type drum modes and wave functions\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode01.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{01}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode02.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{02}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode03.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{03}</math>\nFile:Phi 1s.gif|Wave function of 1s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=2 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 2s.gif|Wave function of 2s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=10 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 3s.gif|Wave function of 3s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=20 a_0</math>)\n</gallery>\n\nNone of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode, and in all of them the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-'''s''' orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.\n\nIn addition, the drum modes analogous to '''p''' and '''d''' modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to '''s'''&nbsp;modes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-'''s''' orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"p-type drum modes and wave functions\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode11.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{11}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode12.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{12}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode13.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{13}</math>\nFile:Phi 2p.gif|Wave function of 2p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=10 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 3p.gif|Wave function of 3p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=20 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 4p.gif|Wave function of 4p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=25 a_0</math>)\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"d-type drum modes\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode21.gif|Mode <math>u_{21}</math> (3d orbital)\nFile:Drum vibration mode22.gif|Mode <math>u_{22}</math> (4d orbital)\nFile:Drum vibration mode23.gif|Mode <math>u_{23}</math> (5d orbital)\n</gallery>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Cazenave, Lions"}, {"name": "first", "value": "T., P."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Orbital stability of standing waves for some nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Communications in Mathematical Physics"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1982"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "85"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "4"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "549\u2013561"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1007/BF01403504"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1982CMaPh..85..549C"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Lions"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "P.

The <math>n=1</math> orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom. Each successively higher value of <math>n</math> has a higher level of energy, but the difference decreases as <math>n</math> increases. For high <math>n</math>, the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom. In single electron atoms, all levels with different <math>\\ell</math> within a given <math>n</math> are degenerate in the Schr\u00f6dinger approximation, and have the same energy. This approximation is broken to a slight extent in the solution to the Dirac equation (where the energy depends on {{mvar|n}} and another quantum number {{mvar|j}}), and by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and [[quantum electrodynamics]] effects. The latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for '''s'''&nbsp;electrons that go nearer the nucleus, since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge, even in one-electron atoms; see [[Lamb shift]].\n\nIn atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the other electrons. These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution, and so the [[energy level]]s of orbitals depend not only on <math>n</math> but also on <math>\\ell</math>. Higher values of <math>\\ell</math> are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2p state is higher than the 2s state. When <math>\\ell = 2</math>, the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the s-orbital in the next higher shell; when <math>\\ell = 3</math> the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher. The filling of the 3d orbitals does not occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled.\n\nThe increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron\u2013electron interaction effects, and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus, where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons. Thus, in atoms of higher atomic number, the <math>\\ell</math> of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy, and the principal quantum numbers <math>n</math> of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement.\n\nThe energy sequence of the first 35&nbsp;subshells (e.g., 1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) is given in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell with <math>n</math> and <math>\\ell</math> given by its row and column indices, respectively. The number in the cell is the subshell's position in the sequence. For a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms, see the section below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! s\n! p\n! d\n! f\n! g\n! h\n|-\n! 1\n| 1 ||    ||    ||    ||    ||\n|-\n! 2\n| 2 ||  3 ||    ||    ||    ||\n|-\n! 3\n| 4 ||  5 ||  7 ||    ||    ||\n|-\n! 4\n| 6 ||  8 || 10 || 13 ||    ||\n|-\n! 5\n| 9 || 11 || 14 || 17 || ''21'' ||\n|-\n! 6\n|12 || 15 || 18 || ''22'' || ''26'' || ''31''\n|-\n! 7\n|16 || 19 || ''23'' || ''27'' || ''32'' || ''37''\n|-\n! 8\n|''20'' || ''24'' || ''28'' || ''33'' || ''38'' || ''44''\n|-\n! 9\n|''25'' || ''29'' || ''34'' || ''39'' || ''45'' || ''51''\n|-\n! 10\n|''30'' || ''35'' || ''40'' || ''46'' || ''52'' || ''59''\n|}\n\n''Note: empty cells indicate non-existent sublevels, while numbers in italics indicate sublevels that could (potentially) exist, but which do not hold electrons in any element currently known.''\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Electron shell"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "n"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "j"}]}], "id": 18}, {"title": " Electron placement and the periodic table ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Electron orbitals.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Electron]] atomic and [[molecular orbital|molecular]] orbitals. The chart of orbitals ('''left''') is arranged by increasing energy (see [[Madelung rule]]). ''Note that atomic orbits are functions of three variables (two angles, and the distance&nbsp;{{mvar|r}} from the nucleus). These images are faithful to the angular component of the orbital, but not entirely representative of the orbital as a whole.'']]\n\n[[File:Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction.ogv|thumb|Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction]]\n\n{{Main|electron configuration|electron shell}}\n\nSeveral rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (''[[electron configuration]]''). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals, as well as [[Spin quantum number|{{mvar|s}}]], or [[spin quantum number]]. Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of&nbsp;{{mvar|s}}. However, ''only'' two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.\n\nAdditionally, an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a [[photon]]) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.\n\nThis behavior is responsible for the structure of the [[periodic table]]. The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1 at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain period has number ''i'', it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the ''i''th shell. [[Niels Bohr]] was the first to propose (1923) that the [[Periodic table|periodicity]] in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels, resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.<ref name=\"Bohr\">{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = Niels | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title = \u00dcber die Anwendung der Quantumtheorie auf den Atombau. I | journal = [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] | year = 1923 | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | page = 117|bibcode = 1923ZPhy...13..117B |doi = 10.1007/BF01328209 }}</ref>\n\nThe periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular '[[Periodic table block|blocks]]'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same {{mvar|\u2113}}-state (but the {{mvar|n}} associated with that {{mvar|\u2113}}-state depends upon the period). For instance, the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of [[Lithium|Li]] and [[Beryllium|Be]] respectively belong to the 2s&nbsp;subshell, and those of [[sodium|Na]] and [[magnesium|Mg]] to the 3s&nbsp;subshell.\n\nThe following is the order for filling the \"subshell\" orbitals, which also gives the order of the \"blocks\" in the periodic table:\n\n:'''1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p'''\n\nThe \"periodic\" nature of the filling of orbitals, as well as emergence of the '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' \"blocks\", is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows (\"periods\") in the matrix. Then, each subshell (composed of the first two quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each entry representing two successive elements:\n\n{| style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n|<pre>\n1s\n2s                                                  2p  2p  2p\n3s                                                  3p  3p  3p\n4s                              3d  3d  3d  3d  3d  4p  4p  4p\n5s                              4d  4d  4d  4d  4d  5p  5p  5p\n6s  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  5d  5d  5d  5d  5d  6p  6p  6p\n7s  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  6d  6d  6d  6d  6d  7p  7p  7p\n</pre>\n|}\n\nAlthough this is the general order of orbital filling according to the Madelung rule, there are exceptions, and the actual electronic energies of each element are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms (see [[Electron configuration#Atoms: Aufbau principle and Madelung rule]]).\n\nThe number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the [[atomic number]].

When applied to atomic orbitals, this means that the energy differences between states are also discrete. A transition between these states (i.e., an electron absorbing or emitting a photon) can thus only happen if the photon has an energy corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states.\n\nConsider two states of the hydrogen atom:\n\nState 1) {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''m''<sub>''\u2113''</sub> = 0}} and {{math|1=''s'' = +}}{{sfrac|1|2}}\n\nState 2) {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''m''<sub>''\u2113''</sub> = 0}} and {{math|1=''s'' = +}}{{sfrac|1|2}}\n\nBy quantum theory, state&nbsp;1 has a fixed energy of {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub>}}, and state&nbsp;2 has a fixed energy of {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub>}}. Now, what would happen if an electron in state&nbsp;1 were to move to state&nbsp;2? For this to happen, the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>}}. If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value, it cannot jump from state&nbsp;1 to state&nbsp;2. Now, suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>}} will be absorbed by the electron in state&nbsp;1, and that electron will jump to state&nbsp;2. However, photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron, because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals, it cannot jump to a state between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum, known as an absorption line, which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2.\n\nThe atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra, which are observed experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model.\n\nThe atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory, which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Atomic electron transition"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''n'' = 1"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''\u2113'' = 0"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''m''<sub>''\u2113''</sub> = 0"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''s'' = +"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''n'' = 2"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''\u2113'' = 0"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''m''<sub>''\u2113''</sub> = 0"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''s'' = +"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''E''<sub>1</sub>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''E''<sub>2</sub>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>"}]}], "id": 22}, {"title": " See also ", "paragraphs": "<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[:commons:Hydrogen_orbitals_3D|3D hydrogen orbitals on Wikimedia Commons]]\n* [[Atomic electron configuration table]]\n* [[Condensed matter physics]]\n* [[Electron configuration]]\n* [[Energy level]]\n* [[Hund's rules]]\n* [[Molecular orbital]]\n* [[Quantum chemistry]]\n* [[Quantum chemistry computer programs]]\n* [[Solid state physics]]\n* [[Wave function collapse]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Div col", "values": [{"name": "colwidth", "value": "20em"}]}], "id": 23}, {"title": " References ", "paragraphs": "{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{cite book | last=McCaw | first=Charles S. | title=Orbitals: With Applications in Atomic Spectra | date=2015 | location=Singapore | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company | isbn=9781783264162 | url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Orbitals/F8s7DQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover | language=en}}\n* {{cite book| last1=Tipler | first1=Paul | first2=Ralph|last2= Llewellyn | year=2003 | title=Modern Physics | edition=4 | location=New York |publisher=W.
