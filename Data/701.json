She was born in c. 14 BC the daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], a close supporter of Rome's first [[emperor]] [[Augustus]], and Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]]. At the time of her birth, her brothers [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]] and [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] were the adoptive sons of Augustus and were his heirs until their deaths in AD 2 and 4, respectively. Following their deaths, her cousin [[Germanicus]] was made the adoptive son of [[Tiberius]] as part of Augustus' succession scheme in the adoptions of AD 4 in which Tiberius was adopted by Augustus. As a corollary to the adoption, Agrippina was wed to Germanicus in order to bring him closer to the [[Julia (gens)|Julian]] family.\n\nShe is known to have traveled with him throughout his career, taking her children everywhere they went. In AD 14, Germanicus was deployed in Gaul as governor and general. While there, the late Augustus sent her son [[Caligula|Gaius]] to her unspecified location.{{clarify|date=April 2019}} She liked to dress him in a little soldiers' outfit complete with boots for which Gaius earned the nickname \"Caligula\" (\"little soldier's boots\"). After three years in Gaul they returned to Rome and her husband was awarded a triumph on 26 May AD 17 to commemorate his victories. The following year, Germanicus was sent to govern over the eastern provinces. While Germanicus was active in his administration, the governor of Syria [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] began feuding with him. During the feud, her husband died of illness on 10 October AD 19.\n\nGermanicus was cremated in [[Antioch]] and she transported his ashes to Rome where they were interred at the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]. Agrippina was vocal in claiming her husband was murdered to promote Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] (\"Drusus the Younger\") as heir. Following the model of her grandmother [[Livia]], she spent the time following Germanicus' death supporting the cause of her sons [[Nero Julius Caesar|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar]]. This put her and her sons at odds with the powerful [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] who would begin eliminating their supporters with accusations of treason and sexual misconduct in AD 26. Her family's rivalry with Sejanus would culminate with her and Nero's exile in AD 29. Nero was exiled to [[Ponza|Pontia]] and she was exiled to the island of [[Pandateria]], where she would remain until her death by starvation in AD 33.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Prominent Roman woman of the first century CE"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2013"}]}, {"name": "Infobox royalty\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Agrippina the Elder"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Agripina Maior (M.A.N.

He was a key general in Augustus' armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against [[Mark Antony]] and [[Sextus Pompeius]]. From early in the emperor's reign, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who appeared to be on his deathbed in 23{{nbsp}}BC, a sign that he would become ''[[princeps]]'' were Augustus to die. It is probable that he was to rule until the emperor's nephew, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], came of age. However, Marcellus died that year of an illness that became an epidemic in Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunson|2014|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Southern|2013|p=203}}</ref><ref name=Dunston274>{{harvnb|Dunstan|2010|p=274}}</ref>\n\nNow, with Marcellus dead, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter [[Julia the Elder]], who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given ''[[tribunician power|tribunicia potestas]]'' (\"the tribunician power\") in 18 BC, a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain. The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate, and it was first given to Julius Caesar. Agrippa acted as tribune in the Senate to pass important legislation and, though he lacked some of the emperor's power and authority, he was approaching the position of co-regent.<ref name=Dunston274/><ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|pp=52\u201354}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scullard|2013|p=216}}</ref>\n\nAfter the birth of Agrippa's second son, [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], in 17 BC, Lucius and his brother [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] were adopted together by Augustus. Around the time of their adoption in the summer, Augustus held the fifth ever ''[[Ludi Saeculares]]'' (\"Secular Games\"). [[Cassius Dio]] says the adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace \u2013 the ''[[Pax Augusta]]''.

On her mother's side, she was the younger granddaughter of Augustus. She was the Stepdaughter of [[Tiberius]] by her mother's marriage to him, and sister in law of [[Claudius]], the brother of her husband [[Germanicus]]. Her son [[Caligula|Gaius]], better known as \"Caligula\", would be the fourth emperor, and her grandson [[Nero]] would be the last emperor of the dynasty.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1999|p=321}}</ref>\n\nIn 13 BC, her father returned to Rome and was promptly sent to [[Pannonia]] to suppress a rebellion. Agrippa arrived there that winter (in 12 BC), but the Pannonians gave up that same year. Agrippa returned to [[Campania]] in Italy, where he fell ill and died soon after. After her father's death, she spent the rest of her childhood in Augustus' household where access to her was strictly controlled.<ref name=Powell194>{{harvnb|Powell|2015|p=194}}</ref><ref name=Wood65>{{harvnb|Wood|1999|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome of the currency issued in 13\u201312 BC, the ''[[aurei]]'' and ''[[denarius|denarii]]'', make it clear that her brothers Gaius and Lucius were Augustus' intended heirs. Their father was no longer available to assume the reins of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen.

Although he initially considered Agrippina's second cousin Germanicus a potential heir for a time, Livia convinced Augustus to adopt Tiberius, Livia's son from her first marriage with [[Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. Although Augustus adopted Tiberius, it was on condition that Tiberius first adopt Germanicus so that Germanicus would become second in the line of succession.

She was pregnant at the time and, while Germanicus was collecting taxes across Gaul, she remained at an unspecified separate location, presumably for her safety. Augustus sent her a letter with her son's party, which read:<ref name=\"Barrett41\"/>\n{{quote|Yesterday I arranged with Talarius and Asillinus to bring your boy Gaius on the fifteen day before the [[Kalends]] of June, if it be the will of the gods.

As a result, Tiberius was made ''princeps''. While Germanicus was administering the oath of fealty to Tiberius, a mutiny began among the forces on the Rhine. During the mutiny, Agrippina brought out their sixth child, Gaius, and made preparations to take him away to a safer town nearby. He was in a full army outfit including the legionary hobnailed boots (''caligae''). These military-booties earned Gaius the nickname \"Caligula\" (lit. \"little boots\"), and garnered sympathy for Agrippina and the child among the soldiery. Tacitus attributes her actions as having quelled the mutiny (Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 1.40\u20134).<ref name=Mellor369/><ref name=\"MacLachlan 2013 135\">{{harvnb|MacLachlan|2013|p=135}}</ref>\n\nOnce the mutiny was put to an end, Germanicus allowed the soldiers to deal with the ringleaders, which they did with brutal severity. He then led them against the Germanic tribes, perhaps in an effort to prevent future mutiny. Germanicus would remain in Gaul fighting against the Germanic tribes until AD 16, at which time he was recalled to Rome by Tiberius. His campaigns won him much renown among the Roman people, and he was awarded a triumph on 26 May AD 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|2015|pp=45\u20136}}</ref>\n\n===Widowhood===\n[[File:Benjamin West 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Benjamin West]], ''Agrippina landing at Brundisium with the ashes of Germanicus'' (1766), oil on canvas.

Agrippina may have suspected Tiberius' involvement in the death of her husband and, with Germanicus dead, she no longer had any familial ties to the emperor. Historian [[Richard Alston (classicist)|Richard Alston]] says it is likely that either Tiberius or Livia were behind the exile of Agrippina's half-sister and the death of Postumus. He notes the death of Agrippina's mother, who starved herself to death amidst her exile in AD 14, linking her death to Tiberius' disdain for her.<ref>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=30}}</ref>\n\nAgrippina was vocal about her feelings claiming that Germanicus was murdered to promote Drusus the Younger as Tiberius' heir, and worried that the birth of the Younger Drusus' twin sons would displace her own sons in the line of succession. Her fears proved to be unfounded, with her son Nero receiving the ''[[toga virilis]]'' (\"toga of manhood\") from Tiberius and the Younger Drusus on 7 June AD 20. Further, Nero was promised the office of [[quaestor]] five years before the ordinary age and was wed to Tiberius' granddaughter [[Julia Livia|Julia]]. Agrippina's second oldest son Drusus was given similar honors and was also promised the office of quaestor in advance when he reached his fourteenth year in AD 23.<ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1999|p=124}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|p=87}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time, Tiberius' [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]] was becoming powerful in Rome and began feuding with Drusus the Younger. While the exact causes of the feud are unknown, it ended when the Younger Drusus died of seemingly natural causes on 14 September AD 23. After the death of Tiberius' son, Agrippina wanted to advance the careers of her sons, who were all potential heirs for Tiberius. To achieve this, Agrippina presented the [[Great Cameo of France]] to Tiberius. It was a personalized gift that positioned the family of Germanicus around the emperor. The work was designed to convince Tiberius to choose her children as his heirs. It is likely she was the one who commissioned the Great Cameo of France.<ref name=Fischer46>{{harvnb|Fischer|2016|p=46}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1999|p=127}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the death of Tiberius' son elevated her own children to the position of heirs. Her sons were the logical choice, because they were the sons of Germanicus and Tiberius' grandsons were too young. Nero was becoming popular in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] due in part, Tacitus says, to his resemblance with his father. The rise of her children was threatening to Sejanus' position. Resultantly, Sejanus began spreading rumors about Agrippina in the imperial court. The coming years were marked with increasing hostility between Sejanus and Agrippina and her sons. This effectively caused factions to rise in the aristocracy between her family and Sejanus.<ref name=Fischer46/><ref name=Alston31>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=31}}</ref>\n\n===Political rivalry===\n[[File:Bronze sestertius with the head of Agrippina the Elder, daughter of Agrippa and Julia, the daughter of Augustus.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze [[sestertius]] with Agrippina on the obverse.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1911|p=219}}</ref>]]\nOn [[New Year's Day]], AD 24, Sejanus had the [[pontiff|priests]] and magistrates add prayers for the health of Nero and Drusus in addition to those normally offered to the emperor on that day. Tiberius was not happy with this and he voiced his displeasure in the Senate. In addition, he questioned the priests of the [[Palatine]]. Some of the priests who offered the prayers were relatives of Agrippina and Germanicus. This made Tiberius suspicious of her and marked a change in his attitude toward her and her older sons, but not Caligula.<ref>{{harvnb|Dando-Collins|2008|pp=94\u20135}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Adams|2007|p=107}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 25, Sejanus requested Livilla's hand in marriage. Livilla was a niece of the emperor, which would have made him a member of the imperial family. While this did make his ambitions clear, his request was denied. The loss may have been huge for Sejanus had the dissensions in the imperial household not been deteriorating. Relations were so bad that Agrippina refused to eat at Tiberius' dinner parties for fear of being poisoned. She also asked Tiberius if she could be allowed to remarry, which he also refused.<ref name=Alston31/>\n\nIf either of them were allowed to remarry it would have threatened the line of succession that Tiberius was comfortable with. By refusing Sejanus' request, Tiberius made it clear he was content with the children of Germanicus and his own grandchildren being his successors. Had Sejanus married Livilla, their children would have provided another line of possible successors. The implication of Agrippina's request was that she needed a man from outside the imperial family to serve as protector and step-father of possible imperial heirs, a powerful position. It was also an implied reprimand: Tiberius was meant to be the guardian of the imperial family.<ref name=Alston31/>\n\nTiberius was in a tough position. He was faced with a conflict between his family and his friend. His solution was surprising. In AD 26, left Rome altogether and retired to the island of [[Capri]] in the [[Bay of Naples]]. He cut himself off from the factions altogether and abandoned politics. He left Rome in the care of Sejanus.

By this time, his association with Tiberius was such that there were those in Roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor.

Tacitus reports a letter being sent to the Senate from Tiberius denouncing Agrippina for her arrogance and prideful attitude, and Nero for engaging in shameful sexual activities. The Senate would not begin highly unpopular prosecutions against her or her son until it received clear instructions from Tiberius to do so. Despite public outcry, Agrippina and Nero were declared public enemies (''hostes'') following a repeat of the accusations by the emperor.

In it, he portrays women as having a profound influence on politics. The women of the imperial family in particular are depicted by Tacitus as having a notable prominence in the public sphere as well as possessing a ferocity and ambition with which they pursue it. Tacitus presents them as living longer than the imperial men and thus being more wise as they advance in age. Among the most broad of his portrayals is that of Agrippina. He emphasizes their role in connecting genetically back to Augustus, a significant factor in the marriages of the emperors and princes of the dynasty. The Annals repeatedly has Agrippina competing for influence with Tacitus simply because she is related to Augustus biologically.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldherr|2009|pp=285\u20136}}</ref>\n\nTacitus presents Agrippina as being kindred to aristocratic males,<ref name=\"L'Hoir131\"/> and has her reversing gender roles, which showcases her assumption of male ''[[auctoritas]]'' (\"authority\") with metaphors of her dressing and undressing. In an example of Agrippina assuming ''auctoritas'', he says:<ref>{{harvnb|L'Hoir|2006|pp=136\u20137}}</ref> {{Verse translation|lang=la|''Sed femina ingens animi munia ducis per eos dies induit militibusque, ut quis inops aut saucius, vestem et fomenta dilargita est. tradit C.

In it, he portrays women as having a profound influence on politics. The women of the imperial family in particular are depicted by Tacitus as having a notable prominence in the public sphere as well as possessing a ferocity and ambition with which they pursue it. Tacitus presents them as living longer than the imperial men and thus being more wise as they advance in age. Among the most broad of his portrayals is that of Agrippina. He emphasizes their role in connecting genetically back to Augustus, a significant factor in the marriages of the emperors and princes of the dynasty. The Annals repeatedly has Agrippina competing for influence with Tacitus simply because she is related to Augustus biologically.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldherr|2009|pp=285\u20136}}</ref>\n\nTacitus presents Agrippina as being kindred to aristocratic males,<ref name=\"L'Hoir131\"/> and has her reversing gender roles, which showcases her assumption of male ''[[auctoritas]]'' (\"authority\") with metaphors of her dressing and undressing.

These changes in style served to make reproducing them more popular in the mid-first-century AD. Reproductions of her image would continue to be made into that period. In the portrait, she is given a youthful face despite the fact that she lived to middle age. Agrippina's hair is a mass of curls that covers both sides of her head and is long going down to her shoulders. Her portraiture can be contrasted with that of Livia who had a more austere Augustan hairstyle.<ref>{{harvnb|Kleiner|2016|p=139}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different periods during the first-century AD when portraits were created for Agrippina: at the time of her marriage to Germanicus (which made her the mother of a potential emperor); when her son Caligula came into power in AD 37, and collected her ashes from the island of Pandateria for relocation to the Mausoleum of Augustus; and at the time of Claudius' marriage to [[Antonia Minor]], who wanted to connect himself to the lineage of Augustus by evoking Agrippina's image. Coins and inscriptions cannot act as a method of discerning her age, because her hairstyle remains unchanged in all the representations.<ref name=Giroire73>{{harvnb|Giroire|Roger|2007|p=73}}</ref>\n\nThe easiest phase of portraits to identify are those dating to the time of Caligula, when a fair abundance of coins were minted with an image of his mother on them. It is a posthumous portrait of her with idealized features. In the phase following Claudius' marriage, her features are made to more closely resemble those of her daughter. The goal was to strengthen Agrippina the Younger's connection with her mother. Finally, the portraits of her dating to the time of Tiberius are still idealized, but not as much as those from the period of Caligula's reign. Images of Agrippina from this period are the most lifelike.<ref name=Giroire73/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "harv", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Fischer"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2016"}, {"name": "p", "value": "54"}]}, {"name": "harv", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kleiner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2016"}, {"name": "p", "value": "143"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kleiner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2016"}, {"name": "p", "value": "143"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Kleiner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2016"}, {"name": "p", "value": "139"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Giroire"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Roger"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "p", "value": "73"}]}], "id": 14}, {"title": "Legacy", "paragraphs": "Agrippina has been depicted in many works of art.
