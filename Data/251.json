Bell made a number of inventions as a formal British citizen after immigrating to Canada and then moving to the United States, including the telephone in 1876; however, he did not become an American citizen until 1882. Therefore, if nationality is to be described specifically ... Alexander Graham Bell, British inventor of the telephone, died as an American citizen in Canada. The wording in the lead paragraph was carefully crafted after input from many editors to accommodate the many diverse claims. It is recognized that in the last years of his life, Bell had American citizenship, although he lived primarily in Canada on his estate. His life's work and details on his nationality and citizenship are provided in later sections.

His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbour whose family operated a flour mill. At the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation at the mill and used steadily for a number of years.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=16}} In return, Ben's father John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to \"invent\".{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=16}}\n\nFrom his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he revelled in mimicry and \"voice tricks\" akin to [[ventriloquism]] that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12), and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=9}} He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackay |first=James |title=Sounds Out of Silence: A life of Alexander Graham Bell |location=Edinburgh, UK |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |date=1997 |p=25 |isbn=978-1-85158-833-6 |ref=harv}}</ref> Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study [[acoustics]].\n\nHis family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his ''The Standard Elocutionist'' (1860),{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. ''The Standard Elocutionist'' appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct [[deaf-mute]]s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write [[Visible Speech]] but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=7}} Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including [[Latin]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and even [[Sanskrit]], accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=7}}\n\n{{Commons category|Alexander_Graham_Bell#Earlier_photos_of_Bell.27s_ancestral_family|a young Bell with his parents}}\n\n===Education===\nAs a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, he was enrolled at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at the age of 15, having completed only the first four forms.{{sfn|Mackay|1997|p=31}} His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his father.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=11}} Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Town |first=Florida |title=Alexander Graham Bell |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=Grolier |date=1988 |p=7 |isbn=978-0-7172-1950-6 |ref=harv}}</ref> At the age of 16, Bell secured a position as a \"pupil-teacher\" of [[elocution]] and music, in Weston House Academy at [[Elgin, Moray]], Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and \u00a310 per session.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=37}} The following year, he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]]; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to [[University College London]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Shulman |first=Seth |title=The Telephone Gambit: Chasing Alexander Bell's Secret |location=New York |publisher=Norton & Company |date=2008 |p=[https://archive.org/details/telephonegambitc00shul/page/49 49] |isbn=978-0-393-06206-9 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/telephonegambitc00shul/page/49 }}</ref>\n\n===First experiments with sound===\nHis father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique [[automaton]] developed by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] based on the earlier work of [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen]].{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} The rudimentary \"mechanical man\" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a \"big prize\" if they were successful.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} While his brother constructed the throat and [[larynx]], Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could \"speak\", albeit only a few words.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} The boys would carefully adjust the \"lips\" and when a [[bellows]] forced air through the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], a very recognizable \"Mama\" ensued, to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nIntrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's [[Skye Terrier]], \"Trouve\".{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=9}} After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [[vocal cords]] to produce a crude-sounding \"Ow ah oo ga ma ma\". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate \"How are you, grandma?\" Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a \"talking dog\".{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=30}} These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using [[tuning fork]]s to explore [[resonance]].\n\nAt age 19, Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'').{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=30}} Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s work, ''The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music''.{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=46}}\n\nDismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork \"contraption\", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition,<ref name=\"DCB\" /> Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: \"Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech.\" He also later remarked: \"I thought that Helmholtz had done it&nbsp;... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder&nbsp;...

Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a [[telegraph]] wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=45}} Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward \"Ted,\" was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as \"A. G. Bell\") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at [[University College London]], Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.\n\nHelping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in [[South Kensington]], London. His first two pupils were [[deaf-mute]] girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=67\u201328}}{{refn|The family pet was given to his brother's family.|group=N}} conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp),{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=68}} and join his father and mother in setting out for the \"[[New World]]\".

Watson]], an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.\n\nWith financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant,{{refn| Hubbard's financial support to the research efforts fell far short of the funds needed, necessitating Bell to continue teaching while conducting his experiments.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fitzgerald |first=Brian |url=http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2001/09-14/bell.html |title=Alexander Graham Bell: The BU Years |newspaper=B.U.

Bell also sought an additional CAD$150 from the former [[Premier (Canada)|Premier of Canada]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], in exchange for 50% of the patent rights in the British Empire (Brown later retracted his offer to patent the telephone in the U.K. for fear of being ridiculed). The [[Bell Telephone Company#Predecessor to the Bell Company|Bell Patent Association]], composed of Hubbard, Sanders and Bell and which would become the precursor of the Bell Telephone Company (and later, [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]), would later assign an approximate 10% interest of its shares to Watson,{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=291}} in lieu of salary and for his earlier financial support to Bell while they worked together creating their first functional telephone.|group=N}} and the two of them experimented with [[acoustic telegraphy]]. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the \"gallows\" [[sound-powered telephone]], which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.\n\n===The race to the patent office===\n{{Main|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}\nIn 1875, Bell developed an [[Acoustic Telegraph|acoustic telegraph]] and drew up a [[patent application]] for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n<!--not in the right article- belongs in the Gray and Bell controversy---NPOV involved--[[File:Bell-gray-smoking-gun.png|thumb|Excerpts from Elisha Gray's patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander Graham Bell's lab notebook entry of March 8, note their similarity]]--->\n[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent<ref>{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: \"Improvement in Telegraphy\" filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}</ref> drawing, March 7, 1876]]\n\nMeanwhile, [[Elisha Gray]] was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent, 174465, March 7, 1876]]\nBell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. Bell's patent covered \"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound\"{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|pp=12\u201313}}{{refn|A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown, described as \"probably the most valuable patent ever.\"|group=N}} Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.\n\nOn March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the [[electrical resistance]] in the circuit. When Bell spoke the sentence \"Mr. Watson\u2014Come here\u2014I want to see you\" into the liquid transmitter,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://quotegrab.com/telephones/mr-watson-come-here |title=Alexander Graham Bell - Lab notebook pp. 40\u201341 (image 22) |website=Quotegrab |publisher=IAP Quotegrab |access-date=September 17, 2019|date=August 2, 2019 }}</ref> Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=12}}\n\nAlthough Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray,{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=211}} Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment,{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=99}} to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible \"articulate speech\" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=98}} After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=100}}\n\nThe question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in his previous application in which he described a cup of mercury, not water. He had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe [[Patent clerk|patent examiner]], Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in an [[affidavit]] that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, [[Marcellus Bailey]], with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1875|r=-2|fmt=eq}}). Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details.

On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent, 174465, March 7, 1876]]\nBell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. Bell's patent covered \"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound\"{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|pp=12\u201313}}{{refn|A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown, described as \"probably the most valuable patent ever.\"|group=N}} Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.\n\nOn March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the [[electrical resistance]] in the circuit. When Bell spoke the sentence \"Mr. Watson\u2014Come here\u2014I want to see you\" into the liquid transmitter,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://quotegrab.com/telephones/mr-watson-come-here |title=Alexander Graham Bell - Lab notebook pp. 40\u201341 (image 22) |website=Quotegrab |publisher=IAP Quotegrab |access-date=September 17, 2019|date=August 2, 2019 }}</ref> Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=12}}\n\nAlthough Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray,{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=211}} Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment,{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=99}} to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible \"articulate speech\" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=98}} After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=100}}\n\nThe question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in his previous application in which he described a cup of mercury, not water. He had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe [[Patent clerk|patent examiner]], Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in an [[affidavit]] that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, [[Marcellus Bailey]], with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1875|r=-2|fmt=eq}}). Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details.

During his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a [[magnetic field]] on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the [[tape recorder]], the [[hard disc]] and [[floppy disc]] drive, and other [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]].\n\nBell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. [[Methane]] gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with [[composting toilet]]s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] to heat houses.\n\n===Photophone===\n{{Main|Photophone}}\n[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|Photophone receiver, one half of Bell's wireless [[optical communication]] system, ca. 1880]]\n\nBell and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a [[photophone]], which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of [[light]].{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=336}}<ref name=\"SDU\">{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Newell |url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020219111153/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 19, 2002 |title=First 'Radio' Built by San Diego Resident Partner of Inventor of Telephone: Keeps Notebook of Experiences With Bell |location=San Diego, California |website=Evening Tribune |date=July 31, 1937 |access-date=November 26, 2009 }}</ref> Both men later became full associates in the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Laboratory projects|Volta Laboratory Association]].\n\nOn June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] in Washington, D.C., to Bell at the window of his laboratory, some {{convert|213|m|round=5|order=flip}} away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.{{sfn|Carson|2007|pp=76\u201378}}{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=338}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Groth |first=Mike |url=http://www.bluehaze.com.au/modlight/GrothArticle1.htm |title=Photophones Revisted |journal=Amateur Radio |date=April 1987 |pp=12\u201317 |access-date=September 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802001855/http://www.bluehaze.com.au/modlight/GrothArticle1.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Mims III |first=Forest M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoaSp1BJu50C |title=The First Century of Lightwave Communications |journal=Fiber Optics Weekly Update |date=February 10\u201326, 1982 |pp=11 of 6\u201323 }}</ref>\n\nBell believed the photophone's principles were his life's \"greatest achievement\", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was \"the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Phillipson |first1=Donald J.C. |first2=Laura |last2=Neilson |title=Alexander Graham Bell |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |date=March 4, 2015 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alexander-graham-bell/ |access-date=September 19, 2015}}</ref> The photophone was a precursor to the [[fiber-optic communication]] systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite report|last=Morgan |first=Tim J. |title=The Fiber Optic Backbone |publisher=[[University of North Texas]] |date=2011 |url=https://classes.lt.unt.edu/Summer_10W_2011/LTEC_4550_020/tjm0146/Fiber%20Optic%20Backbone%20.docx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132141/https://classes.lt.unt.edu/Summer_10W_2011/LTEC_4550_020/tjm0146/Fiber%20Optic%20Backbone%20.docx |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 25, 2015 |access-date=September 19, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"AmericanScientist-1984.V72.No1\">{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stewart E. |jstor=i27852430 |title=Lightwaves and Telecommunication|journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=72 |issue=1 |date=January\u2013February 1984 |pp=66\u201371}}</ref> Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.\n\n===Metal detector===\n[[File:Telephone Inventor\u2019s Voice Heard in Restored Recording \u00ab Science World.theora.ogv|thumb|Bell's voice, from a [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] recording in 1885.

Garfield|shooting]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find [[Charles J. Guiteau|Guiteau]]'s bullet, partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.{{sfn|Grosvenor|Wesson|1997|p=107}} Garfield's surgeons, led by self-appointed chief physician [[Doctor Willard Bliss]], were skeptical of the device, and ignored Bell's requests to move the President to a bed not fitted with metal springs.{{sfn|Grosvenor|Wesson|1997|p=107}} Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.{{sfn|Grosvenor|Wesson|1997|p=107}}\n\nBell's own detailed account, presented to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet. Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell \"proceeded to the [[White House|Executive Mansion]] the next morning&nbsp;... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect.\" In a footnote, Bell adds, \"The death of President Garfield and the subsequent ''post-mortem'' examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bell |first=Alexander Graham |date=1882 |title=Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=25 |issue=145 |pages=22\u201361 |url=https://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell |access-date=April 29, 2013 |ref=harv|bibcode=1883AmJS...25...22B |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-25.145.22 }}</ref>\n\n===Hydrofoils===\n{{Main|HD-4}}\n[[File:Bell HD-4.jpg|thumb|Bell [[HD-4]] on a test run ca. 1919]]\n\nThe March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplanes]]. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article, he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. \"Casey\" Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.\n\nDuring his world tour of 1910\u201311, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the ''Dhonnas Beag'' (Scottish Gaelic for ''little devil''), the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.{{sfn|Boileau|2004|p=18}} The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial [[HD-4]], powered by [[Renault]] engines. A top speed of {{convert|54|mph|km/h}} was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability, and steering, along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.{{sfn|Boileau|2004|pp=28\u201330}} In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia]], to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=off}} engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of {{convert|70.86|mph|km/h|abbr=off}},{{sfn|Boileau|2004|p=30}} a record which stood for ten years.\n\n===Aeronautics===\n{{Main|Aerial Experiment Association|AEA Silver Dart}}\n[[File:AEA Silver Dart.jpg|thumb|AEA Silver Dart ca.&nbsp;1909]]\n\nIn 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek \"young\" help as Bell was at the age of 60.\n\nIn 1898, Bell experimented with [[tetrahedral]] [[box kite]]s and wings constructed of multiple compound [[tetrahedral kite]]s covered in maroon silk.{{refn|Bell was inspired in part by Australian aeronautical engineer [[Lawrence Hargrave]]'s work with man-carrying box kites.<ref>{{cite book |title=Technical Gazette |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1924 |p=46}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}</ref> Hargrave declined to take patents on his inventions, similar to Bell's decision not to file patents on some of his inventions.

Garfield|shooting]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find [[Charles J.

Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell \"proceeded to the [[White House|Executive Mansion]] the next morning&nbsp;... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect.\" In a footnote, Bell adds, \"The death of President Garfield and the subsequent ''post-mortem'' examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bell |first=Alexander Graham |date=1882 |title=Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=25 |issue=145 |pages=22\u201361 |url=https://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell |access-date=April 29, 2013 |ref=harv|bibcode=1883AmJS...25...22B |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-25.145.22 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Grosvenor"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Wesson"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "p", "value": "107"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Grosvenor"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Wesson"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "p", "value": "107"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Grosvenor"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Wesson"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "p", "value": "107"}]}, {"name": "Cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Bell"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Alexander Graham"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1882"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "American Journal of Science"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "25"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "145"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "22\u201361"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "April 29, 2013"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "harv"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1883AmJS...25...22B"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.2475/ajs.s3-25.145.22"}]}], "id": 16}, {"title": "Hydrofoils", "paragraphs": "{{Main|HD-4}}\n[[File:Bell HD-4.jpg|thumb|Bell [[HD-4]] on a test run ca. 1919]]\n\nThe March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplanes]]. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article, he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. \"Casey\" Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.\n\nDuring his world tour of 1910\u201311, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the ''Dhonnas Beag'' (Scottish Gaelic for ''little devil''), the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.{{sfn|Boileau|2004|p=18}} The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial [[HD-4]], powered by [[Renault]] engines. A top speed of {{convert|54|mph|km/h}} was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability, and steering, along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.{{sfn|Boileau|2004|pp=28\u201330}} In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia]], to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=off}} engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of {{convert|70.86|mph|km/h|abbr=off}},{{sfn|Boileau|2004|p=30}} a record which stood for ten years.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "HD-4"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Boileau"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "p", "value": "18"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "54"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mph"}, {"name": "3", "value": "km/h"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Boileau"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "28\u201330"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "350"}, {"name": "2", "value": "hp"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kW"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "off"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "70.86"}, {"name": "2", "value": "mph"}, {"name": "3", "value": "km/h"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "off"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Boileau"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2004"}, {"name": "p", "value": "30"}]}], "id": 17}, {"title": "Aeronautics", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Aerial Experiment Association|AEA Silver Dart}}\n[[File:AEA Silver Dart.jpg|thumb|AEA Silver Dart ca.&nbsp;1909]]\n\nIn 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft.

In 1921, he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organizations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a \"defective variety of the human race\".
