A contemporary chronicler, [[Boetius of Dacia|Boethius the Dane]] blamed Haraldsson for the bishop's death. After the Jarl swore oaths to his own innocence, Alexander took the opportunity to assert his claims to the mainland part of the Orkney jarldom. He visited Caithness in person, and hanged the majority of the farmers while mutilating the rest.

Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties. The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This was the Treaty of York, which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth (in the west) and the mouth of the River Tweed (in the east).\n\nAlexander's first wife [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan of England]] died in March 1238 in Essex, and was buried in Dorset.

Together they had one son, the future [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], born in 1241.\n\nA threat of invasion by Henry in 1243 for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to [[Treaty of Newcastle (1244)|make peace]] next year at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].\n\nAlexander now turned his attention to securing the [[Western Isles]], which were still part of the Norwegian domain of [[Scandinavian Scotland#Geography|Su\u00f0reyjar]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> He repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success.<ref name=\"bbc\" />  Alexander set out to conquer these islands but died on the way in 1249.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scotland A Concise History, Fourth Edition|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-500-28987-7|location=New York|page=32}}</ref> This dispute over the Western Isles, also known as the [[Hebrides]], was not resolved until 1266 when [[Magnus VI of Norway]] ceded them to Scotland along with the [[Isle of Man]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-III-king-of-Scotland|title=Alexander III King of Scotland|date=November 28, 2017|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' described Alexander as red-haired:\n<blockquote>\n[King John] taunted King Alexander, and because he was red-headed, sent word to him, saying, 'so shall we hunt the red fox-cub from his lairs.<ref>''Scottish annals from English chroniclers A.D.500 to 1286'', Alan Orr Anderson, Paul Watkins, 1991.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Alexander II.
