The term is also loosely used to refer to [[#Other text-based visual art|text based visual art in general]]. ASCII art can be created with any [[text editor]], and is often used with [[free-form language]]s. Most examples of ASCII [[art]] require a [[Proportional fonts|fixed-width font]] (non-proportional [[typeface|fonts]], as on a traditional [[typewriter]]) such as [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] for presentation.\n\nAmong the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the\ncreations by computer-art pioneer [[Kenneth Knowlton]] from around 1966, who was working for [[Bell Labs]] at the time.<ref name=\"cgihist\">\n{{cite web\n | last         = Carlson\n | first        = Wayne E.\n | url          = http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/timeline.html#1960\n | date         = 2003\n | title        = An Historical Timeline of Computer Graphics and Animation\n | access-date  = 2008-03-05\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080310082944/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/timeline.html#1960\n | archive-date = 2008-03-10\n | url-status     = dead\n}}\n</ref> \"Studies in Perception I\" by [[Ken Knowlton]] and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.<ref name=\"sip1\">{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}} \"1966 Studies in Perception I by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon (Bell Labs)\", [http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/images/bell.jpg Image of Studies in Perception I] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134227/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/images/bell.jpg |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nASCII art was invented, in large part, because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large [[banner page]]s, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk.<ref name=\"Moritsugu2000\">{{cite book |last1=Moritsugu |first1=Steve |title=Practical UNIX |date=2000 |publisher=Que Publishing |isbn=9780789722508 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/practicalunix00mori_1/page/220 220]\u2013221 |url=https://archive.org/details/practicalunix00mori_1 |url-access=registration |quote=banner. |language=en}}</ref> ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "more citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2017"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}, {"name": "cs1-dates", "value": "y"}]}, {"name": "Infobox file format\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "ASCII art"}, {"name": "screenshot", "value": "File:Wikipedia-Ascii.png"}, {"name": "screenshot_size", "value": "300px"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "ASCII art version of the Wikipedia logo"}, {"name": "extensions", "value": ".ascii, .txt, .nfo"}, {"name": "mime", "value": "text/vnd.ascii-art"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Carlson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Wayne E."}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/timeline.html#1960"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2003"}, {"name": "title", "value": "An Historical Timeline of Computer Graphics and Animation"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2008-03-05"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080310082944/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/timeline.html#1960"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "2008-03-10"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Carlson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2003"}]}, {"name": "Webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134227/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/images/bell.jpg"}, {"name": "date", "value": "4 March 2016"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Moritsugu"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Steve"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Practical UNIX"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Que Publishing"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780789722508"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/practicalunix00mori_1/page/220 220]\u2013221"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/practicalunix00mori_1"}, {"name": "url-access", "value": "registration"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "banner."}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "[[File:Illustration of the constellation Sirius - Harley Aratus (c.820-840), f.8v - BL Harley MS 647.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Illustration of the [[Asterism (astronomy)|constellation]] \"[[Canis Major|Sirius]]\" from a 9th-century astronomical manuscript]]\n\n===Typewriter art===\n[[File:Brooklyn-Daily-Eagle-1875-01-06.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=A portion of the [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]], 6 January 1875, showing advertisements made from typewriter art.|A portion of the [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]], 6 January 1875, showing advertisements made from typewriter art.]]\nSince 1867, typewriters have been used for creating visual art.{{better source|date=August 2013}}<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last         = Stark\n | first        = Joan G.\n | authorlink   = Joan Stark\n | title        = The History of ASCII (Text) Art\n | date         = 2001\n | access-date  = 2008-03-05\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091026141759/http://geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm\n | archive-date = 2009-10-26\n | url-status     = dead\n | url          = http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | url         = http://www.typewritermuseum.org/lib/library_art2.html\n | title       = Typewriter Art\n | last        = Robert\n | first       = Paul\n | date        = 2005-05-11\n | publisher   = The Virtual Typewriter Museum\n | access-date = 2008-03-05\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===TTY and RTTY===\nTTY stands for \"TeleTYpe\" or \"TeleTYpewriter\", and is also known as [[Teleprinter]] or Teletype.\nRTTY stands for [[Radioteletype]]; [[character set]]s such as [[Baudot code]], which predated ASCII, were used.

Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online [[MUD]]s, an acronym for \"Multi-User Dungeon\", (which are textual [[multiplayer]] [[role-playing video game]]s), [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[E-mail]], [[message boards]] and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed [[Monospaced font|fixed-width]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2012"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2012"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "ANSI", "paragraphs": "ASCII and more importantly, [[ANSI escape code|ANSI]] were staples of the early technological era; terminal systems relied on coherent presentation using color and control signals standard in the terminal protocols.\n\nOver the years, [[warez]] groups began to enter the ASCII art scene.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last         = Necromancer\n | title        = History of the PC Ascii Scene\n | website      = [[textfiles.com]]\n | date         = 1998-03-06\n | url          = http://artscene.textfiles.com/history/essays/pcascii.txt\n | access-date  = 2008-03-05\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080215200828/http://artscene.textfiles.com/history/essays/pcascii.txt\n | archive-date = 2008-02-15\n | url-status     = live\n}}\n</ref> Warez groups usually release [[.nfo]] files with their software, [[Software cracking|cracks]] or other general software reverse-engineering releases.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | author       = Defacto2\n | url          = http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm\n | date         = 2008\n | title        = Defacto2 \u2013 Scene Documents, text and NFO files\n | publisher    = defacto2.net\n | access-date  = 2008-03-05\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080312071317/http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm\n | archive-date = 2008-03-12\n | url-status     = live\n}}\n</ref> The ASCII art will usually include the warez group's name and maybe some ASCII borders on the outsides of the release notes, etc.<ref>[http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm NFO Files collection at Defacto2.net, with NFO files that date back to 1989].

There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[kaomoji]] (literally \"face characters\".) Traditionally, they are referred to as \"ASCII face\".\n\nMore complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures.

On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.\n\nMicrosoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font \"[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]\", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see [[List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art|ASCII and ANSI art viewers]]), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#\"Block\" ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article.

It is also called \"Amiga style\", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <code>_/\\-+=.()<>:</code>. The \"oldskool\" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.\nThis is an example of \"[[Amiga]] style\" (also referred to as \"old school\" or \"oldskool\" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name=\"asciistyles\"/>\n\nThe Amiga ASCII scene surfaced in 1992, seven years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal (later known as \"DeZign\"). This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style \"Oldskool\". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.\n\nThe Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called \"ASCII collections\" and not \"art packs\" like on the IBM PC.\n\n=====In text editors=====\n<pre style=\"float:right;\">\n _____ ___ ____ _      _   \n|  ___|_ _/ ___| | ___| |_ \n| |_   | | |  _| |/ _ \\ __|\n|  _|  | | |_| | |  __/ |_ \n|_|   |___\\____|_|\\___|\\__|\n\n</pre>\nThis kind of ASCII art is handmade in a text editor.

On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.\n\nMicrosoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font \"[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]\", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see [[List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art|ASCII and ANSI art viewers]]), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#\"Block\" ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article.

It is also called \"Amiga style\", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <code>_/\\-+=.()<>:</code>. The \"oldskool\" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.\nThis is an example of \"[[Amiga]] style\" (also referred to as \"old school\" or \"oldskool\" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name=\"asciistyles\"/>\n\nThe Amiga ASCII scene surfaced in 1992, seven years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal (later known as \"DeZign\"). This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style \"Oldskool\". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.\n\nThe Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called \"ASCII collections\" and not \"art packs\" like on the IBM PC.\n\n=====In text editors=====\n<pre style=\"float:right;\">\n _____ ___ ____ _      _   \n|  ___|_ _/ ___| | ___| |_ \n| |_   | | |  _| |/ _ \\ __|\n|  _|  | | |_| | |  __/ |_ \n|_|   |___\\____|_|\\___|\\__|\n\n</pre>\nThis kind of ASCII art is handmade in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include [[Microsoft Notepad]], [[CygnusEd]]itor aka. CED ([[Amiga]]), and [[EditPlus]]2 ([[Wintel|PC]]).\n\n[[Oldskool font]] example from the PC, which was taken from the ASCII editor [[FIGlet]].\n\n====Newskool style ASCII art====\n[[File:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII screenshot]]\n\"Newskool\" is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like \"$#Xxo\".

In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, [[iCE Advertisements|ICE]], \"Insane Creators Enterprise\".<ref name=\"100years\">[http://www.cow.net/conned/notacon/artscene/notacon-100artscene-transcript.txt 100 YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ART SCENE], Presented by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky]] and [[RaD Man]] ([[ACiD Productions|ACiD]]), [[Notacon]] Conference \u2013 Cleveland, Ohio, USA, 23\u201325 April 2004.</ref>\n\nThere is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with \"Hardcore\" ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact not [[ANSI art]], because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.\n\nMicrosoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font \"[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]\", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see [[List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art|ASCII and ANSI art viewers]]), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#\"Block\" ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article.

It is also called \"Amiga style\", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <code>_/\\-+=.()<>:</code>. The \"oldskool\" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.\nThis is an example of \"[[Amiga]] style\" (also referred to as \"old school\" or \"oldskool\" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name=\"asciistyles\"/>\n\nThe Amiga ASCII scene surfaced in 1992, seven years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal (later known as \"DeZign\"). This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style \"Oldskool\". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.\n\nThe Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called \"ASCII collections\" and not \"art packs\" like on the IBM PC.\n\n=====In text editors=====\n<pre style=\"float:right;\">\n _____ ___ ____ _      _   \n|  ___|_ _/ ___| | ___| |_ \n| |_   | | |  _| |/ _ \\ __|\n|  _|  | | |_| | |  __/ |_ \n|_|   |___\\____|_|\\___|\\__|\n\n</pre>\nThis kind of ASCII art is handmade in a text editor.

In spite of its name, the style is not \"new\"; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by \"Oldskool\" and \"Block\" style ASCII art. It was dubbed \"Newskool\" upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.<ref name=\"asciistyles\"/>\n\nNewskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for \"fine tuning\" and \"tweaking\". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 18}, {"title": "Methods for generating ASCII art", "paragraphs": "{{Main|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}}\n\nWhile some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs, such as [[JavE]] have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because to generate the required characters on a standard keyboard, one needs to know the [[Alt code]] for each character. For example, {{keypress|Alt}}+{{keypress|1}}{{keypress|7}}{{keypress|8}} will produce \u2593, {{keypress|Alt}}+{{keypress|1}}{{keypress|7}}{{keypress|7}} will produce \u2592, and {{keypress|Alt}}+{{keypress|8}} will produce \u25d8.\n\nThe special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular [[DOS]]-based editors, such as [[TheDraw]] and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the [[function key]]s to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for [[Windows NT|Windows]].\n\n===Image to text conversion===\nOther programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]].

ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.\n\nSome ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading.

It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, eight background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. [[ANSI.SYS]], if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets.

However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for [[xterm]]. Windows has the [[Courier New]] font, which includes characters like \u250c\u2565\u2500\u2568\u2510\u2665\u263a\u01b8\u0335\u0321\u04dc\u0335\u0328\u0304\u01b7).

This could be produced either on a screen or on a printer by typing a character, backing up, and then typing another character, just as on a typewriter. This developed into sophisticated graphics in some cases, such as the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system (circa 1973), where superscript and subscript allowed a wide variety of graphic effects. A common use was for [[emoticon]]s, with WOBTAX and VICTORY both producing convincing smiley faces.<ref>[http://www.platohistory.org/blog/2012/09/plato-emoticons-revisited.html PLATO Emoticons, revisited], Brian Dear, ''[http://www.platohistory.org/ PLATO History: Remembering the future],'' 2012-09-19</ref> Overprinting had previously been used on typewriters, but the low-resolution pixelation of characters on video terminals meant that overprinting here produced seamless pixel graphics, rather than visibly overstruck combinations of letters on paper.\n\nBeyond pixel graphics, this was also used for printing photographs, as the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, were printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ANSI art"}]}, {"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Mon\u0101"}]}, {"name": "nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "'''Mon\u0101'''"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u30e2\u30ca\u30fc"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Mon\u0101"}]}, {"name": "nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "'''[[2ch]]'''"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Nichanneru"}]}, {"name": "nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "'''Gikoneko'''"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u30ae\u30b3\u732b"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Giko cat"}]}, {"name": "nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "'''[[2ch]]'''"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Nichanneru"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Shift_JIS art"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://monafont.sourceforge.net/index-e.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Mona Font"}, {"name": "website", "value": "monafont.sourceforge.net"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2017-10-19"}]}, {"name": "Further", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Emoticon#Japanese_style"}, {"name": "2", "value": "List of common emoticons#Eastern"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "emoticon"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[wikt:\u9854\u6587\u5b57|\u9854\u6587\u5b57]]"}, {"name": "3", "value": "kaomoji"}, {"name": "4", "value": "emoticon"}]}, {"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Unicode art"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Unicode"}]}, {"name": "or-section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "May 2015"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://obfuscator.uo1.net/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Online Text Obfuscator"}, {"name": "website", "value": "obfuscator.uo1.net"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3470669/should-unicode-be-allowed-in-usernames"}, {"name": "title", "value": "web services - Should Unicode be allowed in usernames?"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Stack Overflow"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Zakas"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Laimonas"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Facebook Page Performance Art Glitchr"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/11/facebook-page-performance-art-glitchr-purposefully-tries-to-activate-code-glitches/"}, {"name": "website", "value": "TechCrunch"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "AOL"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2015-06-23"}, {"name": "ref", "value": "Glitchr"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/unicode-sample-3-2.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Unicode 3.2 test page"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.ltg.ed.ac.uk"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://fsymbols.com/generators/facebook-name/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Facebook profile name style with symbols (fb name font generator)"}, {"name": "website", "value": "fsymbols.com"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://play.google.com/store/search?q=fancy+text&c=apps"}, {"name": "title", "value": "fancy text - Android Apps on Google Play"}, {"name": "website", "value": "play.google.com"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap16.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "World of Spectrum - Documentation - ZX Spectrum manual - Chapter 16"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.worldofspectrum.org"}]}], "id": 23}, {"title": "ANSI art", "paragraphs": "{{Main|ANSI art}}\nThe IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character.

This could be produced either on a screen or on a printer by typing a character, backing up, and then typing another character, just as on a typewriter. This developed into sophisticated graphics in some cases, such as the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system (circa 1973), where superscript and subscript allowed a wide variety of graphic effects. A common use was for [[emoticon]]s, with WOBTAX and VICTORY both producing convincing smiley faces.<ref>[http://www.platohistory.org/blog/2012/09/plato-emoticons-revisited.html PLATO Emoticons, revisited], Brian Dear, ''[http://www.platohistory.org/ PLATO History: Remembering the future],'' 2012-09-19</ref> Overprinting had previously been used on typewriters, but the low-resolution pixelation of characters on video terminals meant that overprinting here produced seamless pixel graphics, rather than visibly overstruck combinations of letters on paper.\n\nBeyond pixel graphics, this was also used for printing photographs, as the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, were printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 29}, {"title": "Creation", "paragraphs": "{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n[[List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art|ASCII art text editors]] are used to create ASCII art from scratch, or to edit existing ASCII art files.\n\nASCII art may be created from an existing digital image using an '''ASCII art converter''', an online tool or a [[software application]], that automatically converts an image into ASCII art, using [[vector quantization]].
