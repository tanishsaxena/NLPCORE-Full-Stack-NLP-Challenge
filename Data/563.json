Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board&mdash;just the bare board, with no electronic parts&mdash;that people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture&mdash;their first company&mdash;Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his [[HP-65]] calculator.
