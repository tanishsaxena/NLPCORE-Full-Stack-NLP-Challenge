Unlike other [[insectivore]]s, it has a long [[pig]]-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a \"least concern\" rating from the [[IUCN]], although its numbers seem to be decreasing.\n\nAardvarks are [[afrothere]]s, a [[clade]] which also includes [[elephants]], [[manatees]], and [[hyraxes]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "pp-semi-vandalism", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "speciesbox\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Aardvark"}, {"name": "fossil_range", "value": "{{Fossil range|5|0|Early [[Pliocene]] \u2013 Recent}}"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Porc formiguer.JPG"}, {"name": "status", "value": "LC"}, {"name": "status_system", "value": "IUCN3.1"}, {"name": "status_ref", "value": "<ref name=\"iucn\">{{harvnb|Lindsey|Cilliers|Griffin|Taylor|2008}}</ref>"}, {"name": "genus", "value": "Orycteropus"}, {"name": "species", "value": "afer"}, {"name": "authority", "value": "([[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]], 1766)"}, {"name": "subdivision_ranks", "value": "Subspecies"}, {"name": "subdivision", "value": "See text"}, {"name": "range_map", "value": "Aardvark area.png"}, {"name": "range_map_caption", "value": "Aardvark range"}, {"name": "range_map_alt", "value": "Map of Africa showing a highlighted range (in green) covering most of the continent south of the Sahara desert"}]}, {"name": "Fossil range", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "5"}, {"name": "2", "value": "0"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Early [[Pliocene]] \u2013 Recent"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Lindsey"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Cilliers"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Griffin"}, {"name": "4", "value": "Taylor"}, {"name": "5", "value": "2008"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u0251\u02d0r"}, {"name": "3", "value": "d"}, {"name": "4", "value": "v"}, {"name": "5", "value": "\u0251\u02d0r"}, {"name": "6", "value": "k"}]}, {"name": "respell", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ARD"}, {"name": "2", "value": "vark"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hoiberg"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "3\u20134"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schlitter"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "p", "value": "86"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Name and taxonomy", "paragraphs": "\n=== Name  ===\nThe aardvark is sometimes colloquially called \"African ant bear\",<ref name=\"Colliers\">{{harvnb|Goodwin|1997|pp=2\u20133}}</ref> \"anteater\" (not to be confused with the [[anteater|South American anteater]]), or the \"Cape anteater\"<ref name=Colliers/> after the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5\u20138 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.<ref name=UR4/>\n\nDuring a foraging period, they will stop and dig a \"V\" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location.<ref name=EoM/> When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of [[insect]]s with its long, sticky tongue\u2014as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded.

If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.<ref name=UR4/>\n\n===Movement===\nThe aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.<ref name=UR4/> It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes,<ref name=UR3/> but otherwise moves fairly slowly.\n\nWhen leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be {{convert|10|m|ft}} away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.<ref name=UR3/>\n\nAside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also [[fossorial|excavates]] burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes.<ref name=EoM/> Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main [[burrow]] is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as {{convert|13|m|ft}}.<ref name=EoM/> These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter.<ref name=Colliers/> The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one.
