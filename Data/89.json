In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.\n\nNew technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]].
