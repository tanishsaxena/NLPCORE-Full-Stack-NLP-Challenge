The capital and most populous city is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], located in the central portion of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, such as the [[Fayetteville\u2013Springdale\u2013Rogers Metropolitan Area]] and [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]], is a population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the state's eastern part is [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]]. The largest city in the state's southeastern part is [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]].\n\nThe [[Territory of Arkansas]] was [[admitted to the Union]] as the 25th state on June 15, 1836.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Cash |first= Marie |title= Arkansas Achieves Statehood |journal= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 2 | date= December 1943 }}</ref> Much of the Delta had been developed for cotton plantations, and the state landowners largely depended on [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] as workers. In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nOn returning to the Union in 1868, the state continued to suffer due to its reliance on the large-scale [[plantation economy]]. Cotton continued as the leading commodity crop, although the cotton market declined. Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment, the state fell behind in terms of its economy and opportunities for residents.\n\n[[White American|White]] rural interests dominated the state's politics by disenfranchisement of African Americans and by refusal to reapportion the legislature. It was not until after the [[civil rights movement]] and federal intervention that more African Americans were able to vote. The Supreme Court overturned rural domination in the South and other states that had refused to reapportion their state legislatures, or retained rules based on geographic districts. In ''[[one man, one vote]]'', it ruled that states had to organize both houses of their legislatures by districts that held approximately equal populations, and that these had to be redefined as necessary after each decade's census.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Arkansas began to diversity its economy. In the 21st century, its economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, [[soybeans]] and [[rice]].\n\nThe [[culture of Arkansas]] is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state. Notable people from the state include politician and educational advocate [[William Fulbright]]; former president [[Bill Clinton]], who also served as the 40th and 42nd governor of Arkansas; general [[Wesley Clark]], former [[NATO]] [[Supreme Allied Commander]]; [[Walmart]] founder and magnate [[Sam Walton]];<ref>{{cite news |last= Parker |first= Suzy |title= Arkansas's hillbilly image persists into 21st century |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/us-hillbilly-arkansas-idUSTRE78O2UT20110925 |location= Little Rock, AR |date= September 25, 2011 |work = Reuters }}</ref> singer-songwriters [[Johnny Cash]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[Jimmy Driftwood]], and [[Glen Campbell]]; actor-filmmaker, [[Billy Bob Thornton]]; poet [[Carolyn D.

short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|\n| colspan=\"14\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly

The [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, ''[[Quigualtam]]''. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas]], in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed \"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs\" which were auctioned off. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former [[aide-de-camp]] Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.<ref name=HUDSONKNIGHTS>{{cite book| authorlink =Charles M.

The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251r|k|\u0259n|s|\u0254\u02d0}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either \"Arkansans\" or \"Arkansawyers\". In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (official text):\n<blockquote>Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the terminal \"s\" is an innovation to be discouraged.</blockquote>\nCitizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s|_|\u02c8|r|\u026a|v|\u0259r}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.\n\nSettlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century.

On May 6, a state convention voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name=\"bol\" />\n\nArkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the [[Mississippi River]] and surrounding Southern states. The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union general [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863 to 1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, [[guerrilla]] warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 200.</ref> Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.\n\nUnder the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the [[Radical Republicans]] and Unionists, and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]], they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.\n\n===End of the Reconstruction===\n\nIn 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War\u2014Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091926/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified, re-enfranchising former Confederates.\n\nIn 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)\n\nAfter Reconstruction, the state began to receive more [[immigrants]] and [[migrant worker|migrants]]. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.<ref>William D.

In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property.\n[[File:Wife and children of a sharecropper in Washington County, Arkansas - NARA - 195845.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wife and children of a [[sharecropper]] in Washington County, Arkansas, c. 1935]]\n\nConstruction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].\n\n===Rise of the Jim Crow laws===\n\nIn the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time, more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.\n\nBy 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to enforce constitutional rights.<ref>[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&issue_id=36&page=3 \"White Primary\" System Bars Blacks from Politics\u20141900, ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3.

The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from [[Ulster]], of Scots and Northern Borders descent.\n\nBased on the order of President [[Franklin D.

Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] in 1954 that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional, some students worked to integrate schools in the state. The [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention in 1957 when the Federal government had to intervene to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] had ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine\u2014Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115012/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=723 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Prominent American figures from Arkansas===\n\n[[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd president of the United States, was born in [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]].

The [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, ''[[Quigualtam]]''. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas]], in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed \"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs\" which were auctioned off. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former [[aide-de-camp]] Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.<ref name=HUDSONKNIGHTS>{{cite book| authorlink =Charles M.

The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251r|k|\u0259n|s|\u0254\u02d0}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either \"Arkansans\" or \"Arkansawyers\". In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (official text):\n<blockquote>Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables.

College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings.

The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas's policy of not playing intrastate games.<ref>{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}</ref> Two other campuses of the [[University of Arkansas System]] are Division I members.

The state's other Division{{nbsp}}I member is the [[University of Central Arkansas]], which is a full member (including football) of the FCS [[Southland Conference]].\n\nSeven of Arkansas's smaller colleges play in [[NCAA Division II]], with six in the [[Great American Conference]] and one in the [[Lone Star Conference]]. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in [[NCAA Division III]], in which [[athletic scholarship]]s are prohibited.\n\nBaseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886 to the 1920s. Two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey\u2013Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in the [[Texas League]].\n\nRelated to the state's frontier past, hunting continues in the state.

The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas's policy of not playing intrastate games.<ref>{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}</ref> Two other campuses of the [[University of Arkansas System]] are Division I members. The [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] is a member of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]], a league whose members all play football in the second-level [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS).

The state's other Division{{nbsp}}I member is the [[University of Central Arkansas]], which is a full member (including football) of the FCS [[Southland Conference]].\n\nSeven of Arkansas's smaller colleges play in [[NCAA Division II]], with six in the [[Great American Conference]] and one in the [[Lone Star Conference]]. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in [[NCAA Division III]], in which [[athletic scholarship]]s are prohibited.\n\nBaseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886 to the 1920s. Two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey\u2013Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in the [[Texas League]].\n\nRelated to the state's frontier past, hunting continues in the state. The state created the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in 1915 to regulate hunting and enforce those regulations.<ref>{{cite web |last= Griffee |first= Carol |title= Odyssey of Survival, A History of the Arkansas Conservation Sales Tax |page= 10 |url= http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= September 16, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082707/http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |archive-date= January 17, 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting [[duck]] in the [[Mississippi flyway]] and [[deer]] across the state.<ref name=\"Sutherlin 1996, p. 164\">Sutherlin 1996, p. 164.</ref> Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.<ref name=\"Sutherlin 1996, p. 164\"/>\n\nFishing has always been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of [[Norfork Dam]], the [[Norfork Tailwater]] and the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] have become a destination for [[trout]] fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas|Bull Shoals]], [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas|Hot Springs Village]], and [[Fairfield Bay, Arkansas|Fairfield Bay]] have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake.

In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.\n\nArkansas has elected only three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]]; [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]; and [[Tom Cotton]], who defeated Mark Pryor in the 2014 elections. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012.

[[White nationalist]] groups such as [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (abbreviated CSA. In the 1980s this group had a compound in the Ozarks, later raided by the authorities) found cover in the Ozarks, as the overwhelmingly [[White people|white]] towns are small and spread far and wide throughout the mountains. The [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|Knights of the KKK]] and the [[Kingdom Identity Ministries]] (a [[Christian identity]] organization) made their headquarters in the state at this time.

Presenting himself as a \"New Democrat\" and using incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Read my lips: no new taxes|broken promise]] against him, Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).\n\nMost Republican strength traditionally lay mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.\n\nArkansas has elected only three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]]; [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]; and [[Tom Cotton]], who defeated Mark Pryor in the 2014 elections. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and [[Virginia]]) for any period during the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nIn 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2012, Republicans won election for all four House seats. Arkansas held the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed entirely of military veterans ([[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]], [[United States Army|Army]]; [[Tim Griffin]], [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]; [[Steve Womack]], Army [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]; [[Tom Cotton]], Army). In 2014, the last Democrat in Arkansas's congressional delegation, Mark Pryor, was defeated in his campaign to win a third term in the U.S. Senate, leaving the entire congressional delegation in GOP hands for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\nReflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent.

Wade]]'' is ever overturned.\n\n====White supremacy, hate crimes====\n\nArkansas is one of only four states in the U.S. to not have any legal protection against [[hate crimes]] (an anti-hate crimes measure passed the state Senate in 2001 but failed before a House panel, and a similar bill failed in 2017). The forests of Arkansas and the [[Ozarks|Ozark mountain region]] have provided cover for clandestine hate groups. [[White nationalist]] groups such as [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (abbreviated CSA.
