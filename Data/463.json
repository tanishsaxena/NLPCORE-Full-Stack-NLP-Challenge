Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean and other spaces]]. These are called [[dihedral angle]]s. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the [[spherical angle]] formed by two [[great circle]]s on a [[sphere]] is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.\n\n''Angle'' is also used to designate the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of an angle or of a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. This measure is the ratio of the length of a [[arc (geometry)|circular arc]] to its [[radius]]. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\nThe word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning \"corner\"; [[cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ''(ankyl\u03bfs)'', meaning \"crooked, curved,\" and the [[English language|English]] word \"[[ankle]]\". Both are connected with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*ank-'', meaning \"to bend\" or \"bow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Slocum|2007}}</ref>\n<!--Note: \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 rather than \u1f00\u03bd\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is correct, the \u03b3\u03ba is a digraph pronounced [\u014bk].-->\n\n[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177\u2013178}}</ref><!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.-->\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "distinguish", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Angel"}]}, {"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "angles in geometry"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Sidorov"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2001"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Slocum"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Heiberg"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1908"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "177\u2013178"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Identifying angles", "paragraphs": "In mathematical expressions, it is common to use [[Greek letter]]s (<var>\u03b1</var>, <var>\u03b2</var>, <var>\u03b3</var>, <var>\u03b8</var>, <var>\u03c6</var>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) to serve as [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] standing for the size of some angle.

Lower case Roman letters (''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) are also used, as are upper case Roman letters in the context of [[polygon]]s. See the figures in this article for examples.\n\nIn geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted \u2220BAC (in Unicode {{unichar|2220|ANGLE|HTML=}}) or <math>\\widehat{\\rm BAC}</math>. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex (\"angle A\").\n\nPotentially, an angle denoted, say, \u2220BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see [[#Positive and negative angles|Positive and negative angles]]). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that \u2220BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and \u2220CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c0"}]}, {"name": "unichar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2220"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ANGLE"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Types of angles", "paragraphs": "{{Redirect|Oblique angle|the cinematographic technique|Dutch angle}}\n===Individual angles===\nThere is some common terminology for angles, whose measure is always non-negative (see [[#Positive and negative angles]]):\n* An angle equal to 0\u00b0 or not turned is called a zero angle.\n* Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90\u00b0) are called ''acute angles'' (\"acute\" meaning \"sharp\").\n* An angle equal to {{sfrac|4}} turn (90\u00b0 or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians) is called a ''[[right angle]]''.

An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are equal in measure).\n* Two angles which share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called ''coterminal angles''.\n* A ''reference angle'' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians), to the results as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and {{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180\u2013150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750\u2013720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|title=Mathwords: Reference Angle|website=www.mathwords.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023035017/http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|archivedate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|adjacent}} Vertical and adjacent angle pairs===\n[[File:Vertical Angles.svg|thumb|150px|left|Angles A and B are a pair of vertical angles; angles C and D are a pair of vertical angles.]]\n\nWhen two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.\n* A pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an \"X\"-like shape, are called ''vertical angles'' or ''opposite angles'' or ''vertically opposite angles''. They are abbreviated as ''vert. opp. \u2220s''.<ref name=\"tb\">{{harvnb|Wong|Wong|2009|pp=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n:The equality of vertically opposite angles is called the ''vertical angle theorem''. [[Eudemus of Rhodes]] attributed the proof to [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Euclid]]|title=The Elements||orig-year=300 BC|title-link=Euclid's Elements}} Proposition I:13.</ref>{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} The proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical Note,{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\n:In the figure, assume the measure of Angle ''A'' = ''x''. When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, the measure of Angle ''C'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Similarly, the measure of Angle ''D'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Both Angle ''C'' and Angle ''D'' have measures equal to 180 \u2212 ''x'' and are congruent. Since Angle ''B'' is supplementary to both Angles ''C'' and ''D'', either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle ''B''. Using the measure of either Angle ''C'' or Angle ''D'' we find the measure of Angle ''B'' = 180 \u2212 (180 \u2212 ''x'') = 180 \u2212 180 + ''x'' = ''x''. Therefore, both Angle ''A'' and Angle ''B'' have measures equal to ''x'' and are equal in measure.\n\n[[File:Adjacentangles.svg|right|thumb|225px|Angles ''A'' and ''B'' are adjacent.]]\n* ''Adjacent angles'', often abbreviated as ''adj. \u2220s'', are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle or full angle are special and are respectively called ''complementary'', ''supplementary'' and ''explementary'' angles (see \"Combine angle pairs\" below).\n\nA [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with ''alternate interior angles'', ''corresponding angles'', ''interior angles'', and ''exterior angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=255}}\n\n===Combining angle pairs===\nThere are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles:\n{{anchor|complementary angle}}\n[[File:Complement angle.svg|thumb|150px|The ''complementary'' angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> (<var>b</var> is the ''complement'' of <var>a</var>, and <var>a</var> is the complement of <var>b</var>).]]\n* ''Complementary angles'' are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle ({{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because the sum of internal angles of a [[triangle]] is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.\n:The adjective complementary is from Latin ''complementum'', associated with the verb ''complere'', \"to fill up\". An acute angle is \"filled up\" by its complement to form a right angle.\n:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the ''complement'' of the angle.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}</ref>\n:If angles ''A'' and ''B'' are complementary, the following relationships hold:\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sin^2A + \\sin^2B = 1 & & \\cos^2A + \\cos^2B = 1 \\\\[3pt]\n& \\tan A = \\cot B  & & \\sec A = \\csc B\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:(The [[tangent]] of an angle equals the [[cotangent]] of its complement and its secant equals the [[cosecant]] of its complement.)\n:The [[prefix]] \"[[co (function prefix)|co-]]\" in the names of some trigonometric ratios refers to the word \"complementary\".\n{{clear|right}}\n[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|right|300px|The angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are ''supplementary'' angles.]]\n* {{anchor|Linear pair of angles|Supplementary angle}}Two angles that sum to a straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''supplementary angles''.\n:If the two supplementary angles are [[#adjacent|adjacent]] (i.e. have a common [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a [[line (geometry)|straight line]]. Such angles are called a ''linear pair of angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=97}} However, supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line, and can be separated in space.  For example, adjacent angles of a [[parallelogram]] are supplementary, and opposite angles of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.\n:If a point P is exterior to a circle with center O, and if the [[tangent lines to circles|tangent lines]] from P touch the circle at points T and Q, then \u2220TPQ and \u2220TOQ are supplementary.\n:The sines of supplementary angles are equal. Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\n:In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n{{anchor|explementary angle}}\n[[File:Reflex angle.svg|thumb|right|150px|Sum of two ''explementary'' angles is a ''complete'' angle.]]\n* Two angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360\u00b0, or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''explementary angles'' or ''conjugate angles''.\n*: The difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the ''explement'' of the angle or ''conjugate'' of an angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Polygon-related angles===\n[[File:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and external angles.]]\n* An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an ''[[interior angle]]'' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple [[concave polygon]] has at least one interior angle that is a reflex angle.\n*: In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle]] add up to {{math|\u03c0}} radians, 180\u00b0, or {{sfrac|2}} turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians, 360\u00b0, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2){{math|\u03c0}} radians, or 180(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2) degrees, (2''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;4) right angles, or ({{sfrac|''n''|2}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) turn.\n* The supplement of an interior angle is called an ''[[exterior angle]]'', that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a [[#Linear pair of angles|linear pair of angles]]. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon.{{sfn|Henderson|Taimina|2005|p=104}} If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\n*: In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360\u00b0). The exterior angle here could be called a ''supplementary exterior angle''. Exterior angles are commonly used in [[Logo (programming language)|Logo Turtle programs]] when drawing regular polygons.\n* In a [[triangle]], the [[bisection|bisectors]] of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] (meet at a single point).<ref name=Johnson>Johnson, Roger A.

According to a historical Note,{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\n:In the figure, assume the measure of Angle ''A'' = ''x''. When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, the measure of Angle ''C'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Similarly, the measure of Angle ''D'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Both Angle ''C'' and Angle ''D'' have measures equal to 180 \u2212 ''x'' and are congruent. Since Angle ''B'' is supplementary to both Angles ''C'' and ''D'', either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle ''B''. Using the measure of either Angle ''C'' or Angle ''D'' we find the measure of Angle ''B'' = 180 \u2212 (180 \u2212 ''x'') = 180 \u2212 180 + ''x'' = ''x''. Therefore, both Angle ''A'' and Angle ''B'' have measures equal to ''x'' and are equal in measure.\n\n[[File:Adjacentangles.svg|right|thumb|225px|Angles ''A'' and ''B'' are adjacent.]]\n* ''Adjacent angles'', often abbreviated as ''adj. \u2220s'', are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\".

Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\n:In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n{{anchor|explementary angle}}\n[[File:Reflex angle.svg|thumb|right|150px|Sum of two ''explementary'' angles is a ''complete'' angle.]]\n* Two angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360\u00b0, or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''explementary angles'' or ''conjugate angles''.\n*: The difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the ''explement'' of the angle or ''conjugate'' of an angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "complementary angle"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "4"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{math|\u03c0}}"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c0"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Chisholm"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}]}, {"name": "clear", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "right"}]}, {"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Linear pair of angles"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Supplementary angle"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c0"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Jacobs"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1974"}, {"name": "p", "value": "97"}]}, {"name": "clear", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "right"}]}, {"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "explementary angle"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c0"}]}, {"name": "clear", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "right"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Polygon-related angles", "paragraphs": "[[File:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and external angles.]]\n* An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an ''[[interior angle]]'' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon.

There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon.{{sfn|Henderson|Taimina|2005|p=104}} If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\n*: In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360\u00b0). The exterior angle here could be called a ''supplementary exterior angle''. Exterior angles are commonly used in [[Logo (programming language)|Logo Turtle programs]] when drawing regular polygons.\n* In a [[triangle]], the [[bisection|bisectors]] of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] (meet at a single point).<ref name=Johnson>Johnson, Roger A.

In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\n[[File:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle <var>\u03b8</var> (in radians) is the quotient of <var>s</var> and <var>r</var>.]]\n\nIn order to measure an angle <var>[[theta|\u03b8]]</var>, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length <var>s</var> of the arc by the radius <var>r</var> of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):\n\n:<math> \\theta = k \\frac{s}{2\\pi r}. </math>\n\nThe value of <var>\u03b8</var> thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered.

Substituting ''n'' for ''\u03b8'' and 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|\u03c0}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=\"nb\"|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius <var>r</var>, in addition to the issue of \"measurement units chosen.\" A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc.

Dimitri\u0107 for instance.<ref name=\"Dimitric_2012\"/>}}\n\n===Angle addition postulate===\nThe angle addition postulate states that if ''B'' is in the interior of angle ''AOC'', then\n\n:<math> m\\angle AOC = m\\angle AOB + m\\angle BOC </math>\n\nThe measure of the angle ''AOC'' is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle ''BOC''. In this postulate it does not matter in which [[Units of measurement|unit]] the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.\n\n===Units===\n{{see also|Angular unit}}\n<!-- the less remarkable units may be removed from this section, add them to angular unit (if they are not there yet) -->\n\nUnits used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order. Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].\n\nMost units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.\n\n;[[turn (geometry)|Turn]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1): The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|\u03c4}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application, but in the acronym ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute), just ''r'' is used. A ''turn'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}}} in the formula above. The equivalence of 1 ''turn'' is 360\u00b0, 2{{pi}} rad, 400 grad, and 4 right angles. The symbol {{mvar|\u03c4}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians. Used in this way ({{math|1= ''k'' = {{sfrac|\u03c4|2\u03c0}}}}) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn. For example, half a turn is {{math|1 ={{sfrac|\u03c4|2}} = \u03c0}}.\n\n;[[Quadrant (circle)|Quadrant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4): The ''quadrant'' is {{sfrac|4}} of a turn, i.e. a ''[[right angle]]''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|4}} turn = 100&nbsp;grad. In German the symbol <sup>\u221f</sup> has been used to denote a quadrant.\n\n;[[Sextant (circle)|Sextant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6): The ''sextant'' (''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]'') is {{sfrac|6}} of a turn. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],<ref name=\"Jeans_1947\"/><ref name=\"Murnaghan_1946\"/> and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60\u00b0 = {{pi}}/3&nbsp;rad \u2248 1.047197551&nbsp;rad.\n[[File:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|<var>\u03b8</var> = <var>s</var>/<var>r</var> rad = 1 rad.]]\n\n;[[Radian]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2{{pi}}&nbsp;=&nbsp; 6.283&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a ''radian'' of ''n'' = 2{{pi}} units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|2{{pi}}}} = 1. One turn is 2{{pi}} radians, and one radian is {{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}} degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and \"natural\" properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.\n\n;[[Clock position]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12): A clock position is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]]. One imagines a clock face lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve hour markings with the directions in which they point.\n\n;[[Hour angle]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;24): The astronomical ''hour angle'' is {{sfrac|24}} of a turn. As this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called ''minute of time'' and ''second of time''.  These are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&nbsp;hour = 15\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|12}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|6}}&nbsp;quad. = {{sfrac|24}} ''turn'' = {{sfrac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;grad.\n\n;[[Points of the compass|(Compass) point or wind]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32): The ''point'', used in [[navigation]], is {{sfrac|32}} of a turn. 1&nbsp;point = {{sfrac|8}} of a right angle = 11.25\u00b0 = 12.5&nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.\n\n;[[Hexacontade]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;60): The ''hexacontade'' is a unit of 6\u00b0 that [[Eratosthenes]] used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.\n\n;[[Pechus]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;144\u2013180): The ''pechus'' was a [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] unit equal to about 2\u00b0 or {{sfrac|2|1|2}}\u00b0.\n\n;[[Binary degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256): The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{sfrac|256}} of a turn.<ref name=\"ooPIC\"/> The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2<sup>''n''</sup> equal parts for other values of ''n''.<ref name=\"Hargreaves_2010\"/>\n;[[Degree (angle)|Degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;360): The ''degree'', denoted by a small superscript circle (\u00b0), is 1/360 of a turn, so one ''turn'' is 360\u00b0. The case of degrees for the formula given earlier, a ''degree'' of ''n'' = 360\u00b0 units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|360\u00b0|2{{pi}}}}. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5\u00b0 for three and a half degrees), but the \"minute\" and \"second\" sexagesimal subunits of the \"degree-minute-second\" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]].\n\n;[[Diameter part]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;376.99&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493\u00b0. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n;[[Grad (angle)|Grad]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;400): The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'', is {{sfrac|400}} of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].\n\n;[[Milliradian]]: The milliradian (mil or mrad) is defined as a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] consists of 2000\u03c0 mil (or approximately 6283.185... mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578... degrees (3.43775... minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817... \u2248 {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n;[[Minute of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;21,600):  The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree = {{sfrac|21,600}} turn. It is denoted by a single prime (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;30\u2032 is equal to 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;=&nbsp;210 minutes or 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|30|60}} = 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3\u00b0&nbsp;5.72\u2032 = 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5.72|60}} degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.\n\n;[[Second of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000): The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&nbsp;\u2033&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;7\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033 is equal to 3 + {{sfrac|7|60}} + {{sfrac|30|3600}} degrees, or 3.125&nbsp;degrees.\n\n;[[Milliarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000): mas\n;[[Microarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000,000): \u00b5as\n\n===Positive and negative angles===\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent [[Orientation (geometry)|orientations]] and/or [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative ''y''-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the ''x''-axis rightward and the ''y''-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of \u2212''\u03b8'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''\u03b8''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360\u00b0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;45\u00b0 or 315\u00b0.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is not the same as a rotation of 315\u00b0 (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] or [[azimuth]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45\u00b0 corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315\u00b0.\n\n===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===\nThere are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians.\n\nIn [[rational geometry]] the ''[[spread (rational trigonometry)|spread]]'' between two lines is defined as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines.

Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].\n\nMost units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.\n\n;[[turn (geometry)|Turn]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1): The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|\u03c4}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application, but in the acronym ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute), just ''r'' is used. A ''turn'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}}} in the formula above. The equivalence of 1 ''turn'' is 360\u00b0, 2{{pi}} rad, 400 grad, and 4 right angles. The symbol {{mvar|\u03c4}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians. Used in this way ({{math|1= ''k'' = {{sfrac|\u03c4|2\u03c0}}}}) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn. For example, half a turn is {{math|1 ={{sfrac|\u03c4|2}} = \u03c0}}.\n\n;[[Quadrant (circle)|Quadrant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4): The ''quadrant'' is {{sfrac|4}} of a turn, i.e. a ''[[right angle]]''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|4}} turn = 100&nbsp;grad. In German the symbol <sup>\u221f</sup> has been used to denote a quadrant.\n\n;[[Sextant (circle)|Sextant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6): The ''sextant'' (''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]'') is {{sfrac|6}} of a turn. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],<ref name=\"Jeans_1947\"/><ref name=\"Murnaghan_1946\"/> and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60\u00b0 = {{pi}}/3&nbsp;rad \u2248 1.047197551&nbsp;rad.\n[[File:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|<var>\u03b8</var> = <var>s</var>/<var>r</var> rad = 1 rad.]]\n\n;[[Radian]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2{{pi}}&nbsp;=&nbsp; 6.283&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a ''radian'' of ''n'' = 2{{pi}} units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|2{{pi}}}} = 1. One turn is 2{{pi}} radians, and one radian is {{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}} degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and \"natural\" properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.\n\n;[[Clock position]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12): A clock position is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]]. One imagines a clock face lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve hour markings with the directions in which they point.\n\n;[[Hour angle]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;24): The astronomical ''hour angle'' is {{sfrac|24}} of a turn. As this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called ''minute of time'' and ''second of time''.  These are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&nbsp;hour = 15\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|12}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|6}}&nbsp;quad. = {{sfrac|24}} ''turn'' = {{sfrac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;grad.\n\n;[[Points of the compass|(Compass) point or wind]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32): The ''point'', used in [[navigation]], is {{sfrac|32}} of a turn. 1&nbsp;point = {{sfrac|8}} of a right angle = 11.25\u00b0 = 12.5&nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.\n\n;[[Hexacontade]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;60): The ''hexacontade'' is a unit of 6\u00b0 that [[Eratosthenes]] used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.\n\n;[[Pechus]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;144\u2013180): The ''pechus'' was a [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] unit equal to about 2\u00b0 or {{sfrac|2|1|2}}\u00b0.\n\n;[[Binary degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256): The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{sfrac|256}} of a turn.<ref name=\"ooPIC\"/> The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2<sup>''n''</sup> equal parts for other values of ''n''.<ref name=\"Hargreaves_2010\"/>\n;[[Degree (angle)|Degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;360): The ''degree'', denoted by a small superscript circle (\u00b0), is 1/360 of a turn, so one ''turn'' is 360\u00b0. The case of degrees for the formula given earlier, a ''degree'' of ''n'' = 360\u00b0 units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|360\u00b0|2{{pi}}}}. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5\u00b0 for three and a half degrees), but the \"minute\" and \"second\" sexagesimal subunits of the \"degree-minute-second\" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]].\n\n;[[Diameter part]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;376.99&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493\u00b0. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n;[[Grad (angle)|Grad]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;400): The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'', is {{sfrac|400}} of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].\n\n;[[Milliradian]]: The milliradian (mil or mrad) is defined as a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] consists of 2000\u03c0 mil (or approximately 6283.185... mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578... degrees (3.43775... minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817... \u2248 {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n;[[Minute of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;21,600):  The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree = {{sfrac|21,600}} turn. It is denoted by a single prime (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;30\u2032 is equal to 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;=&nbsp;210 minutes or 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|30|60}} = 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3\u00b0&nbsp;5.72\u2032 = 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5.72|60}} degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.\n\n;[[Second of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000): The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&nbsp;\u2033&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;7\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033 is equal to 3 + {{sfrac|7|60}} + {{sfrac|30|3600}} degrees, or 3.125&nbsp;degrees.\n\n;[[Milliarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000): mas\n;[[Microarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000,000): \u00b5as\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "see also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Angular unit"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c4"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2{{pi}}"}]}, {"name": "mvar", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c4"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "''k'' = {{sfrac|\u03c4|2\u03c0}}"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c4"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2\u03c0"}]}, {"name": "math", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{sfrac|\u03c4|2}} = \u03c0"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u03c4"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "4"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{pi}}"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "4"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "6"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2{{pi}}"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2{{pi}}"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "180"}, {"name": "2", "value": "{{pi}}"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "24"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{pi}}"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "6"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "24"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "16"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "3"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "32"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "8"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "256"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "360\u00b0"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2{{pi}}"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "60"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "400"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "6400"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2{{pi}}"}, {"name": "2", "value": "6400"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1000"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "60"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "21,600"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "30"}, {"name": "2", "value": "60"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "5.72"}, {"name": "2", "value": "60"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "60"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3600"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "7"}, {"name": "2", "value": "60"}]}, {"name": "sfrac", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "30"}, {"name": "2", "value": "3600"}]}], "id": 11}, {"title": "Positive and negative angles", "paragraphs": "Although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent [[Orientation (geometry)|orientations]] and/or [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative ''y''-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the ''x''-axis rightward and the ''y''-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of \u2212''\u03b8'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''\u03b8''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360\u00b0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;45\u00b0 or 315\u00b0.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is not the same as a rotation of 315\u00b0 (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] or [[azimuth]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45\u00b0 corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315\u00b0.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 12}, {"title": "Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle", "paragraphs": "There are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage.
