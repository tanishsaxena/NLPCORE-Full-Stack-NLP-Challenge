However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.\n\n[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900&nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.<ref>Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200\u2013479&nbsp;BC''.</ref> The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].\n\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|[[Delian League]], under the leadership of Athens before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&nbsp;BC]]\n\nBy the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being [[Achaemenid destruction of Athens|captured and sacked twice]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&pg=PA34|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|accessdate=24 December 2014|isbn=978-1400834303|last1=Lewis|first1=John David|date=25 January 2010}}</ref> after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.\n\nThe decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival [[Sparta]].\n\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a [[free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century CE, ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].\n\nBy the end of [[Late Antiquity]], Athens had shrunk due to sacks by the [[Herulians]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Early Slavs]] which caused massive destruction in the city. In this era, the first Christian churches were built in Athens, and the [[Parthenon]] and other temples were converted into churches. Athens expanded its settlement in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.\n\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.\n\nIn the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Kylix Theseus Aison MNA Inv11365 n1.jpg|Tondo of the Aison Cup, showing the victory of [[Theseus]] over the [[Minotaur]] in the presence of [[Athena]].

Athens. It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the [[Athens Metro]] and the Ilektrikos, named [[Omonoia station]]. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the [[Euro 2004]] and the [[EuroBasket 2005]] tournaments.[[File:20090801 athina04.jpg|thumb|Aiolou Street in the Centre.

The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as \"Art for art's sake\" (\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd).

A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as \"rebetadika\", after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.\n*The [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]] ({{lang-el|\u0393\u03ba\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's \"[[Gay village]]\". The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station).\n* '''Syntagma''', [[Syntagma Square]], ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1}}/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and [[List of city squares by size|largest square]], lying adjacent to the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most notable [[Grande Bretagne|hotels]]. Ermou Street, an approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} pedestrian road connecting [[Syntagma Square]] to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists.

It is to be found between the Parliament and [[Zappeion]] buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.\n\nParts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the ''Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens'', which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.<ref name=EUfund/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astynet.gr/ |title=Eaxa :: \u0395\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03a7\u03c9\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3 \u0391.\u0395 |publisher=Astynet.gr |accessdate=21 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228090100/http://www.astynet.gr/ |archivedate=28 February 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> The landmark [[Dionysiou Areopagitou Street]] has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near [[Plaka]], and finishes just beyond the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Thiseio]]. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the [[Parthenon]] and the [[ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.\n\nThe hills of Athens also provide green space. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]], [[Philopappos Monument|Philopappos hill]] and the area around it, including [[Pnyx]] and [[Ardettos hill]], are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the [[Pedion tou Areos]] (''Field of Mars'') of 27.7 hectares, near the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]].\n\nAthens' largest zoo is the [[Attica Zoological Park]], a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.\n\n=== Urban and suburban municipalities ===\n[[File:\u0392\u03af\u03bb\u03b1 \u0391\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 3473.jpg|alt=|thumb|View of Vila Atlantis, in [[Kifissia]], designed by [[Ernst Ziller]].]]\n[[File:Alimos - panoramio (33).jpg|alt=|thumb|Beach in the southern suburb of [[Alimos]], one of the many beaches in the southern coast of Athens]]\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58<ref name=\"statistics1\"/> densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the city centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including [[Agios Stefanos, Attica|Agios Stefanos]], [[Dionysos, Greece|Dionysos]], [[Ekali]], [[Nea Erythraia]], [[Kifissia]], [[Marousi|Maroussi]], [[Pefki]], [[Lykovrysi]], [[Metamorfosi]], [[Nea Ionia]], [[Nea Filadelfeia]], [[Irakleio, Attica|Irakleio]], [[Vrilissia]], [[Melissia]], [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], [[Chalandri]], [[Agia Paraskevi]], [[Galatsi]], [[Psychiko]] and [[Filothei]]); the southern suburbs (including [[Alimos]], [[Nea Smyrni]], [[Moschato]], [[Kallithea]], [[Agios Dimitrios]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Glyfada]], [[Argyroupoli]], [[Ilioupoli]], [[Voula]] and [[Vouliagmeni]]); the eastern suburbs (including [[Zografou]], [[Dafni, Attica|Dafni]], [[Vyronas]], [[Kaisariani]], [[Cholargos]] and [[Papagou]]); and the western suburbs (including [[Peristeri]], [[Ilion, Greece|Ilion]], [[Egaleo]], [[Koridallos]], [[Agia Varvara]], [[Chaidari]], [[Petroupoli]], [[Agioi Anargyroi]] and [[Kamatero]]).\n\nThe Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of [[Piraeus]] to the southernmost suburb of [[Varkiza]] for some {{convert|25|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Greece_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Piraeus%20(Attiki)&toplace=Varkiza%20(Piraios%20Nomos)&fromlat=37.9474464019929&tolat=37.8185988001751&fromlng=23.6370849609375&tolng=23.7987041473389 |title=Distance between Piraeus (Attiki) and Varkiza (Piraios Nomos) (Greece) |publisher=Distancecalculator.globefeed.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref> is also connected to the city centre by a tram.\n\nIn the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex|Olympic Complex]] (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade.

It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the [[Athens Metro]] and the Ilektrikos, named [[Omonoia station]]. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the [[Euro 2004]] and the [[EuroBasket 2005]] tournaments.[[File:20090801 athina04.jpg|thumb|Aiolou Street in the Centre.

The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as \"Art for art's sake\" (\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd).

A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as \"rebetadika\", after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.\n*The [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]] ({{lang-el|\u0393\u03ba\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's \"[[Gay village]]\". The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station).\n* '''Syntagma''', [[Syntagma Square]], ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1}}/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and [[List of city squares by size|largest square]], lying adjacent to the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most notable [[Grande Bretagne|hotels]]. Ermou Street, an approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} pedestrian road connecting [[Syntagma Square]] to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists.

It remains a prime tourist destination with [[taverna]]s, live performances and street salesmen. Nearby [[Monastiraki]] ({{lang-el|\u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9}}), for its part, is known for its string of small shops and markets, as well as its crowded [[flea market]] and tavernas specialising in [[souvlaki]]. Another district known for its student-crammed, stylish caf\u00e9s is [[Temple of Hephaestus|Theseum]] or Thission ({{lang-el|\u0398\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf}}), lying just west of Monastiraki. Thission is home to the ancient [[Temple of Hephaestus]], standing atop a small hill. This area also has a picturesque 11th-century Byzantine church, as well as a 15th-century Ottoman mosque. \n*'''[[Exarcheia]]''' ({{lang-el|\u0395\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}), located north of Kolonaki, is the location of the city's [[anarchism|anarchist]] scene and as a student quarter with caf\u00e9s, bars and bookshops. Exarcheia is home to the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic]] and the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]; it also contains important buildings of several 20th-century styles: [[Neoclassicism]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modern architecture|Early Modernism]] (including [[Bauhaus]] influences).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n*'''[[Kolonaki]]''' ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9}}) is the area at the base of [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus hill]], full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day, and bars and more fashionable restaurants by night, with galleries and museums.

The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near [[Plaka]], and finishes just beyond the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Thiseio]]. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the [[Parthenon]] and the [[ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.\n\nThe hills of Athens also provide green space. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]], [[Philopappos Monument|Philopappos hill]] and the area around it, including [[Pnyx]] and [[Ardettos hill]], are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland.

In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an [[Developed country|industrial nation]].<ref>[http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] \u2013 Retrieved on 6 January 2007</ref> The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across [[Attica]]). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so.

In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an [[Developed country|industrial nation]].<ref>[http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] \u2013 Retrieved on 6 January 2007</ref> The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across [[Attica]]). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so.

The left one is a modernist building of the 1930s, while the right one was built in the 1950s.]]\nAthens incorporates [[architectural style]]s ranging from [[Greek Revival architecture|Greco-Roman]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] to modern times. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly [[Drama (Art Form)|dramatic forms of Art]], they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include [[Orestis Makris]], [[Kalouta sisters]], [[Vasilis Avlonitis]], [[Afroditi Laoutari]], [[Eleni Papadaki]], [[Marika Nezer]], [[Marika Krevata]] and others.

Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[foxtrot]], some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. [[Nikos Gounaris]] was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.\n\nIn 1923, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], many [[ethnic Greeks]] from [[Asia Minor]] fled to Athens as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]].

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000<ref name=tung2/> and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\">\nFile:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].\nFile:Panathenaic Stadium.jpg|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896.\n</gallery>\n\n===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}\nThe [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.\n\n===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}\n[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.<ref name=oly/> It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.<ref name=oly/> Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.<ref name=oly/>\n\nDuring the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.\n\nAlthough the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name=olyy>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.<ref name=olyy/>\n\nThe 2004 Games were judged a success, as both security and organization worked well, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.<ref name=olyy/> The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5&nbsp;million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5&nbsp;million tickets were sold there in 2000).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&folder=200&article=13956 |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=30 March 2007 |title=Olympic ticket sales officially top 3.5-million mark |publisher=Embassy of Greece |author=Athens News Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232754/http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&folder=200&article=13956 |archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 it was reported that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or are in a state of dereliction, with several [[squatting|squatter]] camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by [[vandalism]], graffiti or strewn with rubbish.<ref name=yahoo08>{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Martin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AjpTiz9CDw7_QtyFTlFMB0uVTZd4?slug=ro-beijinglegacy082408&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Beijing trumps Athens... and then some |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=21 March 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090928231642/http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AjpTiz9CDw7_QtyFTlFMB0uVTZd4?slug=ro-beijinglegacy082408&prov=yhoo&type=lgns|url-status=dead |archivedate=28 September 2009}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=csm>{{cite web|last=Itano |first=Nicole |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |title=As Olympic Glow Fades, Athens Questions $15 Billion Cost |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309025855/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |archivedate=9 March 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]] are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use.

They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n==== Sports clubs ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Notable sport clubs based inside the boundaries of [[Athens#Municipality (City) of Athens|Athens Municipality]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Club\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Founded\n!Sports\n!District\n!Achievements\n|-\n|[[Panellinios G.S.]]||1891||Basketball, Volleyball, [[Handball]], Track and Field and others ||[[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]||Panhellenic titles in Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, many honours in Track and Field\n|-\n|[[GS Apollon Smyrnis|Apollon Smyrni]]||1891<br/><small>(originally in [[Smyrni]])</small>||Football, Basketball, Volleyball and others ||[[Rizoupoli]]||Earlier long-time presence in A Ethniki\n|-\n|[[Ethnikos G.S.

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000<ref name=tung2/> and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\">\nFile:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].\nFile:Panathenaic Stadium.jpg|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896.\n</gallery>\n\n===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}\nThe [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.\n\n===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}\n[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.<ref name=oly/> It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.<ref name=oly/> Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.<ref name=oly/>\n\nDuring the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.\n\nAlthough the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name=olyy>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games.

The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.<ref name=olyy/> The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events.

and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.\n\nAthens has hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]] twice, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_stadio.htm |title=Athens 21st Century \u2013 Athens Olympic Stadium |accessdate=26 December 2008 |publisher=Athens-today.com}}</ref> The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]], in [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|1994]] and [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007]].

Events in other sports such as [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], volleyball, [[water polo]] etc., have been hosted in the capital's venues.\n\nAthens is home to three European multi-sport clubs: [[Olympiacos CFP|Olympiacos]], [[Panathinaikos]], [[Athletic Union of Constantinople|AEK Athens]]. In [[association football|football]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] have dominated the domestic competitions, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] made it to the [[1971 European Cup Final]], while [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] is the other member of the [[P.O.K.|big three]]. These clubs also have basketball teams; [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] six times and three respectively, whilst [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]] was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.\n\nOther notable clubs within Athens are [[Athinaikos]], [[Panionios]], [[Atromitos F.C.|Atromitos]], [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.|Apollon]], [[Panellinios G.S.|Panellinios]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus]], [[Maroussi B.C.|Maroussi BCE]] and [[Peristeri B.C.]]. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.\n\nThe Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].\n\nBeyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_stadio.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Athens 21st Century \u2013 Athens Olympic Stadium"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "26 December 2008"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Athens-today.com"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_faliro.htm"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Athens 21st Century \u2013 The Olympic Coastal Complex"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "26 December 2008"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Athens-today.com"}]}], "id": 42}, {"title": " Sports clubs ", "paragraphs": "\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Notable sport clubs based inside the boundaries of [[Athens#Municipality (City) of Athens|Athens Municipality]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Club\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Founded\n!Sports\n!District\n!Achievements\n|-\n|[[Panellinios G.S.]]||1891||Basketball, Volleyball, [[Handball]], Track and Field and others ||[[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]||Panhellenic titles in Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, many honours in Track and Field\n|-\n|[[GS Apollon Smyrnis|Apollon Smyrni]]||1891<br/><small>(originally in [[Smyrni]])</small>||Football, Basketball, Volleyball and others ||[[Rizoupoli]]||Earlier long-time presence in A Ethniki\n|-\n|[[Ethnikos G.S.

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000<ref name=tung2/> and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\">\nFile:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].\nFile:Panathenaic Stadium.jpg|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896.\n</gallery>\n\n===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}\nThe [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.\n\n===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}\n[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.<ref name=oly/> It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.<ref name=oly/> Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.<ref name=oly/>\n\nDuring the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.\n\nAlthough the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name=olyy>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games.

The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.<ref name=olyy/> The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events.
