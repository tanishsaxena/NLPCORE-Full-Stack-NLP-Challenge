By hereditary right he was king of [[Sicily]] and claimed the island of [[Sardinia]] for himself, though it was then in the possession of [[Genoa]]. Alfonso was also in possession of much of [[Corsica]] by the 1420s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Escudo armas Alfonso V de Arag\u00f3n en Satyrarum hecatostichon cropped.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Alphonse V of Aragon in ''Satyrarum hecatostichon'' by [[Francesco Filelfo]] (1449).]]\nIn 1421 the childless Queen [[Joanna II of Naples]] adopted and named him as heir to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and Alfonso went to [[Naples]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=164}} Here he hired the [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]] with the task of reducing the resistance of his rival claimant, [[Louis III of Anjou]], and his forces led by [[Muzio Attendolo]] [[Sforza]]. With Pope [[Martin V]] supporting Sforza, Alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the Aragonese [[antipope Benedict XIII]]. When Sforza abandoned Louis' cause, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, [[Gianni Caracciolo]], a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, arrested.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=164}}\n\nAfter an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed, Joan called on Sforza who defeated the Aragonese militias near [[Castel Capuano]] in Naples. Alfonso fled to [[Castel Nuovo]], but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by [[Giovanni da Cardona]] improved his situation.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of [[Aversa]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with the backing of Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.{{sfn|Grierson|Travaini|1998|p=245}}\n\nThe Duke of Milan, [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna's troops in [[L'Aquila]], but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. On his way towards Barcelona, Alfonso sacked [[Marseille]], a possession of Louis III.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}}\n\n[[File:King-alfonsoVaragon2.jpg|left|thumb|Manuscript detail of Alfonso V of Aragon.]]\n\nIn late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti moved in the southern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], rapidly conquering [[Gaeta]], [[Procida]], [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] and [[Sorrento]]. Naples, which was held by Alfonso's brother, Pedro de Aragon,{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna's troops, now led by [[Francesco Sforza]], the son of Muzio Sforza (who had met his death at L'Aquila). The city fell in April 1424. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to [[Sicily]] in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of [[Gianni Caracciolo]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}}\n\nAn opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to [[Ren\u00e9 I of Naples|Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], Louis III's younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, [[Eugene IV]], who nominally was the feudal lord of the King of Naples. The Neapolitans having called in the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured [[Capua]] and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by [[Biagio Assereto]]. In the [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|battle of Ponza]] that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}}\n\nIn Milan, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in February 1436. Meanwhile, papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso bribed their commander, Cardinal [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]], and their successes waned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n{{Aragonese House of Trast\u00e1mara}}\n\nIn the meantime, Ren\u00e9 had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in August 1439. After the death of his condottiero [[Jacopo Caldora]], however, Ren\u00e9's fortune started to decline: Alfonso could easily capture [[Aversa]], [[Salerno]], [[Benevento]], [[Manfredonia]] and [[Bitonto]]. Ren\u00e9, whose possession included now only part of the [[Abruzzi]] and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the [[Marche]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAlfonso, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, ending on 2 June the following year.  After the return of Ren\u00e9 to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} In 1446 he also conquered Sardinia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAlfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope [[Eugene IV]] that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his illegitimate son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]. He died in [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of [[Genoa]]. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]], who died shortly afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nHis Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother John, later king [[John II of Aragon]].{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=147}}  Sicily and [[Sardinia]] were also inherited by his brother.\n\nAlfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of [[Skanderbeg]], whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against [[Murad II]]. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the [[Albania]]n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise.  This was because in 1448, while Skanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by [[Demetrio Reres]] along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, had been dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "164"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "164"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "165"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "165"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Grierson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Travaini"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "p", "value": "245"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "165"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "165"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "165"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armstrong"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "165"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bisson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "p", "value": "144"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bisson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "p", "value": "144"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bisson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "p", "value": "144"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bisson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "p", "value": "144"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bisson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1991"}, {"name": "p", "value": "147"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2019"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Family", "paragraphs": "\nAlfonso had been betrothed to [[Maria of Castile]] (1401\u20131458; sister of [[John II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] on 12 June 1415.
