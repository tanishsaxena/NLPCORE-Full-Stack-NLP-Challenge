It is used by mountain dwellers in the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Austria|Austrian Alps]], [[Bavarian Alps]] in [[Germany]], [[French Alps]], and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[Europe]], from the [[Alps]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. Alphorns are today used as musical instruments.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "More citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2011"}]}, {"name": "Infobox instrument\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Alphorn"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alphorns Grindelwald.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "Charlotte Vignau.

If the latter, were these Latin writings from three centuries unanimous in using the lituus for all three of these instrument types and, further, does this mean the crumhorn was actually still in use in the 18th century?--> Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] used the words ''lituum alpinum'' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''De raris et admirandis herbis'' in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word ''Alphorn'' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[Cistercian]] abbey St. Urban near [[Pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[Batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[Valais]].\n\n17th\u201319th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. Surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden [[Brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the \"B\u00fcchel\" and the \"Allg\u00e4uisches Waldhorn\" or \"Ackerhorn\". The alphorn's exact origins remain indeterminate, and the ubiquity of horn-like signal instruments in valleys throughout Europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2015"}]}, {"name": "Clarify", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2015"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Construction and qualities", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Alphorn player in Wallis.jpg|thumb|right|A Swiss playing alphorn]]\n\nThe alphorn is carved from solid [[softwood]], generally spruce but sometimes pine. In former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base. A cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.\n\nAn alphorn made at Rigi-Kulm, Schwyz, and now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], measures {{convert|8|ft|m}} in length and has a straight tube. The Swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the [[Bernese Oberland]]. [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of H\u00f6lzern Trummet (wooden trumpet) in ''Syntagma Musicum'' (Wittenberg, 1615\u20131619; Pl. VIII).<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alpenhorn, Alphorn|volume=1|page=723|first=Kathleen|last=Schlesinger|authorlink=Kathleen Schlesinger}}</ref>\n\nThe alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure [[Harmonic series (music)|natural harmonic series]] of the open pipe.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western [[equal temperament]]. Most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.\n[[Image:Harmonic Series.png|thumb|center|600px]]\n\nAccomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves, consisting of the 2nd through the 16th notes of the harmonic series. The availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn.\n\n[[Image:Alphorn-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|D'Die\u00df'ner alphorn players.]]\nThe well-known \"[[Ranz des Vaches]]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/19980214205945/http://www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm#PARTITION score]; [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?sid=7020216&cKey=1183635931000&ty=st&rubricId=25004&siteSect=25001 audio]) is a traditional Swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. The song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] introduced the \"Ranz des Vaches\" into his masterpiece ''William Tell,'' along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn. [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] wrote to [[Clara Schumann]] that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First Symphony]] was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the Rigi area of Switzerland.  For Clara's birthday in 1868 Brahms sent her a greeting that was to be sung with the melody.  <Edition Eulenberg score Page I facsimile></ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "8"}, {"name": "2", "value": "ft"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m"}]}, {"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Alpenhorn, Alphorn"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "page", "value": "723"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Kathleen"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Schlesinger"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Kathleen Schlesinger"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "Music for alphorn", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Fanfare 27BCA 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Fanfare du 27e Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpin|military band]] of the French [[Chasseurs Alpins]] uses alphorns.]]\nAmong music composed for the alphorn:\n\n*Concerto Grosso No. 1 (2013) for four alphorns and orchestra by [[Georg Friedrich Haas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universaledition.com/Georg-Friedrich-Haas/composers-and-works/composer/278 |title=Georg Friedrich Haas |publisher=Universal Edition |accessdate=28 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208163014/http://www.universaledition.com/Georg-Friedrich-Haas/composers-and-works/composer/278 |archive-date=8 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eamdc.com/news/bavarian-radio-symphony-orchestra-debuts-concerto-grosso-nr-1-by-georg-friedrich-haas/ |title=EAM: Georg Friedrich Haas's ''Concerto Grosso No. 1'' Debuts with Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra |publisher=European American Music Distributors Company |date=25 February 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n*''Sinfonia pastorale'' for corno pastoriccio in G (alphorn) and string orchestra (1755)  by [[Leopold Mozart]]\n*Concerto for alphorn and orchestra (1970) by [[Jean Daetwyler]]\n*Concerto No. 2 for alphorn (with flute, string orchestra and percussion) (1983) by Daetwyler\n*''Dialogue with Nature'' for alphorn, flute, and orchestra by Daetwyler\n*''Concertino rustico'' (1977) by [[Ferenc Farkas]]\n*''Begegnung'' for three alphorns and concert band, by Kurt Gable.\n*''S\u00e4umerweg-Blues'' [http://real.xobix.ch/ramgen/swissinfo/swissalpinemusic/2006/kurtott_saeumerwegblues.rm (audio played by Kurt Ott)]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} among many compositions by Hans-J\u00fcrg Sommer, [http://www.alphornmusik.ch Alphorn Musik]\n*''Messe'' for alphorn and choir by Franz Sch\u00fcssele [http://www.alphorn-center.de Alphorn-Center]\n* ''Erbauliche Studie f\u00fcr 12 Alph\u00f6rner in Abwesenheit von Bergen'' by Mathias R\u00fcegg (1998)\n*''Wolf Music: Tapio'' for alphorn and echoing instruments (2003) by [[R.
