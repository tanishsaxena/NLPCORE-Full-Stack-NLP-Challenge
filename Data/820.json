The [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with Andean civilisations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of the higher altitude civilisations of among others the [[Muisca Confederation|Muisca]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]]. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.\n\nShell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse{{clarify|date=February 2017}} and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the [[Marajoara culture]]. [[Figurative mound]]s are the most recent types of occupation.\n\nThere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.<ref name=Wohl_p24_25>Wohl, 2011, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] on the island of Maraj\u00f3 may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by [[selective cultivation]] and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as ''[[terra preta]] de \u00edndio'' (\"Indian dark earth\").<ref name=Wohl_p25>Wohl, 2011, p. 25.</ref> Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.<ref name=Wohl_p25/>\n\nMany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare.

Another Spanish explorer, [[Francisco de Orellana]], was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the [[Andes]], to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptised some of the affluents of the Amazonas like [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], [[Napo River|Napo]] and [[Juru%C3%A1_River | Jurua]].\n\n=== Exploration ===\n[[File:The Mara\u00f1on or Amazon River with the Mission of the Society of Jesus WDL1137.png|thumb|[[Samuel Fritz]]'s 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco]]\n\n[[Gonzalo Pizarro]] set off in 1541 to explore east of [[Quito]] into the South American interior in search of ''[[El Dorado]]'', the \"city of gold\" and [[La Canela]], the \"valley of [[cinnamon]]\".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana Francisco de Orellana Francisco de Orellana (Spanish explorer and soldier)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503155124/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana |date=3 May 2009 }}. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> He was accompanied by his second-in-command [[Francisco de Orellana]]. After {{convert|170|km|mi}}, the [[Coca River]] joined the [[Napo River]] (at a point now known as [[Puerto Francisco de Orellana]]); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as ''R\u00edo de la Canela'' (\"Cinnamon River\") and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana apparently missed the confluence (probably with the [[Aguarico River|Aguarico]]) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died at that village. His men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join Pizarro's larger party. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600&nbsp;km down the Napo River they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern [[Iquitos]], and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim\u00f5es, for a further {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern [[Manaus]]), which they reached on 3 June 1542.\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. In fact, true cinnamon (''Cinnamomum verum'') is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family ''Lauraceae'') are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n[[File:Naturalist on the River Amazons figure 38.png|thumb|Masked-dance and wedding-feast of [[Ticuna|Ticuna Indians]], engravings for Bates's 1863 ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'']]\nIn 1560 another Spanish [[conquistador]], [[Lope de Aguirre]], may have made the second descent of the Amazon.

In the late 1600s Czech Jesuit Father [[Samuel Fritz]], apostle of the Omaguas, established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]] must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called [[Lawriqucha|Lauricocha]], near [[Hu\u00e1nuco]].\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th\u201319th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n was generally considered the source of the Amazon.<ref name = \"Dias\">[http://redebrasilis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camila-L.-Dias-Jesuit-Maps-and-Political-Discourse-muse.pdf Camila Loureiro Dias, \"Maps and Political Discourse: The Amazon River of Father Samuel Fritz,\" ''The Americas,'' Volume 69, Number 1, July 2012, pp. 95\u2013116.]</ref>\n\n=== Scientific exploration ===\n[[File:Naturalist on the River Amazons figure 32.png|thumb|upright|[[Henry Walter Bates]] was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848\u20131859).]]\nEarly scientific, zoological and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.\n* [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] explored the river in 1743.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326266/Charles-Marie-de-La-Condamine|title=Charles-Marie de La Condamine (French naturalist and mathematician)|work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=18 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725132645/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326266/Charles-Marie-de-La-Condamine|archivedate=25 July 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Alexander von Humboldt]], 1799\u20131804\n* [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] and [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]], 1817\u20131820\n* [[Georg von Langsdorff]], 1826\u20131828 \n* [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], 1848\u20131859\n* [[Richard Spruce]], 1849\u20131864\n\n=== Post-colonial exploitation and settlement ===\n[[File:Casaamazonica.jpg|thumb|[[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] state]]\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 320px\n | image1 = Centro de Manaus.jpg\n | alt1 = [[Amazon Theatre]] opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom\n | caption1 = [[Amazon Theatre]] opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom\n | image2 = Catedral Metropolitana de Santar\u00e9m, Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, 2007.jpg\n | alt2 = Metropolitan Cathedral of Santarem, in Santarem, Brazil\n | caption2 = Metropolitan Cathedral of Santarem, in [[Santarem, Brazil]]\n | image3 = Iquitos-2012.jpg\n | alt3 = Iglesia Matriz in [[Iquitos, Peru]]\n | caption3 = Iglesia Matriz in [[Iquitos, Peru]]\n}}\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe [[Cabanagem]] revolt (1835\u20131840) was directed against the white ruling class.

The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Par\u00e1 (now Bel\u00e9m), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Man\u00e1os, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as [[Tabatinga]], on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}\n\nOn 6 September 1850, Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mau\u00e1 ([[Irineu Evangelista de Sousa]]) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the \"Companhia de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o e Com\u00e9rcio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the ''Monarca'' ('Monarch'), the ''Camet\u00e1'', the ''Maraj\u00f3'' and the ''Rio Negro''.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Sobre Escravos e Regat\u00f5es|url=http://www.snh2015.anpuh.org/resources/anais/39/1439329194_ARQUIVO_ANPUHSobreescravoseregatoes1.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2015|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nAt first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Par\u00e1 and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Par\u00e1 and Camet\u00e1.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.\n\nThe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Pur\u00fas and Negro; a third established a line between Par\u00e1 and Manaus; and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}\n\nOn 31 July 1867 the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the [[upper Amazon]] basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga \u2013 on the Amazon; Camet\u00e1 \u2013 on the Tocantins; Santar\u00e9m \u2013 on the Tapaj\u00f3s; Borba \u2013 on the Madeira, and Manaus \u2013 on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}\n\nThanks in part to the [[mercantile]] development associated with [[steamboat]] navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for [[natural rubber]], the Peruvian city of [[Iquitos]] became a thriving, cosmopolitan centre of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.<ref>Historia del Peru, Editorial Lexus. p. 93.</ref> During the [[rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as [[typhus]] and [[malaria]], killed 40,000 native Amazonians.<ref>La Republica Oligarchic.

Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company\u2014the Amazon Steam Navigation Company\u2014as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Pur\u00fas and many other tributaries,{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} such as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, to ports as distant as [[Nauta]], Peru.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were [[Natural rubber|India-rubber]], [[cacao bean]]s, [[Brazil nut]]s and a few other products of minor importance, such as [[Fur|pelts]] and exotic forest produce ([[resin]]s, barks, woven [[hammock]]s, prized bird [[feather]]s, live animals) and extracted goods, such as [[lumber]] and gold.\n\n=== 20th-century development ===\n[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Manaus]], the largest city in [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the dark [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and the muddy Amazon River]]\n[[File:Sitio de la Victoria regia, Leticia.JPG|thumb|Floating houses in [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nSince colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.\n\nFour centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than {{convert|65|km2}}, excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=790}} This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.\n\nWary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.\n\nIn the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia.

A large-scale colonization programme saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]] (''Transamaz\u00f4nica'').<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as [[BR-319]] (Manaus-[[Porto Velho]]), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.\n\nMany settlements grew along the road from Bras\u00edlia to Bel\u00e9m with the highway and National Integration Programme, however, the programme failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem.

The [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with Andean civilisations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of the higher altitude civilisations of among others the [[Muisca Confederation|Muisca]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]].

For instance, pre-Columbian [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] on the island of Maraj\u00f3 may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by [[selective cultivation]] and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as ''[[terra preta]] de \u00edndio'' (\"Indian dark earth\").<ref name=Wohl_p25>Wohl, 2011, p. 25.</ref> Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago.

After {{convert|170|km|mi}}, the [[Coca River]] joined the [[Napo River]] (at a point now known as [[Puerto Francisco de Orellana]]); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as ''R\u00edo de la Canela'' (\"Cinnamon River\") and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana apparently missed the confluence (probably with the [[Aguarico River|Aguarico]]) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died at that village. His men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join Pizarro's larger party. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600&nbsp;km down the Napo River they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern [[Iquitos]], and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim\u00f5es, for a further {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern [[Manaus]]), which they reached on 3 June 1542.\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. In fact, true cinnamon (''Cinnamomum verum'') is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family ''Lauraceae'') are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n[[File:Naturalist on the River Amazons figure 38.png|thumb|Masked-dance and wedding-feast of [[Ticuna|Ticuna Indians]], engravings for Bates's 1863 ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'']]\nIn 1560 another Spanish [[conquistador]], [[Lope de Aguirre]], may have made the second descent of the Amazon.

In the late 1600s Czech Jesuit Father [[Samuel Fritz]], apostle of the Omaguas, established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]] must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called [[Lawriqucha|Lauricocha]], near [[Hu\u00e1nuco]].\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon.

From that point, Quebrada [[Carhuasanta]] emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms R\u00edo Lloqueta which becomes R\u00edo Hornillos and eventually joins the [[Apur\u00edmac River|R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac]].\n\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in ''[[Area (journal)|Area]]'', a peer-reviewed journal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the [[Mantaro River|R\u00edo Mantaro]] drainage.<ref name=\"ContosTripcevich\" /> A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur\u00edmac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the [[International Scale of River Difficulty|class IV\u2013V]] nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80&nbsp;km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80&nbsp;km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.geographydirections.com/2014/04/03/redefining-the-upper-amazon-river|last=Contos|first=James (Rocky)|title=Redefining the Upper Amazon River|website=Geography Directions|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=15 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152411/https://blog.geographydirections.com/2014/04/03/redefining-the-upper-amazon-river/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter about {{cvt|700|km|mi}}, the Apur\u00edmac then joins R\u00edo Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the [[Urubamba River]] to form the Ucayali.

From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, some {{cvt|1600|km|mi}}, the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous [[Amazon rainforest]].\n\n=== The Upper Amazon or Solim\u00f5es ===\n[[File:Amazonas, Iquitos - Leticia, Kolumbien (11472506936).jpg|thumb|Amazon River near [[Iquitos]], Peru]]\nAlthough the Ucayali\u2013Mara\u00f1\u00f3n confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the ''[[Solim\u00f5es]] das \u00c1guas''. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the ''Solim\u00f5es'' and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\".\n\nThe Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Per\u00fa. It has a series of major tributaries in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], some of which flow into the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River|Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]] and [[Ucayali]], and others directly into the Amazon proper.

At \u00d3bidos, a bluff {{cvt|17|m|ft}} above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a [[bay|gulf]] of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near \u00d3bidos.\n\nOnly about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of \u00d3bidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above \u00d3bidos city is about {{convert|5000000|km2|sqmi}}, and, below, only about {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi}} (around 20%), exclusive of the {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi}} of the Tocantins basin.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} The [[Tocantins River]] enters the southern portion of the [[Amazon delta]].\n\nIn the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about {{convert|240|km|mi}} from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as [[Monte Alegre, Par\u00e1|Monte Alegre]]. These hills are cut down to a kind of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] which lies between them and the river.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=788}}\n\nOn the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to [[Santar\u00e9m, Brazil|Santar\u00e9m]] in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapaj\u00f3s, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapaj\u00f3s river valley.{{sfn|Church|1911|pp=788\u201389}}\n\n=== Mouth ===\n[[File:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south]]\n[[Bel\u00e9m]] is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The [[Par\u00e1 River|Par\u00e1]] and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called ''furos'' near the town of [[Breves, Par\u00e1|Breves]]; between them lies [[Maraj\u00f3]], the world's largest combined river/sea island.\n\nIf the Par\u00e1 river and the Maraj\u00f3 island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon [[estuary]] is some {{convert|325|km|mi}} wide.<ref name=guo /> In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of [[Pracu\u00faba]] in the Brazilian state of [[Amap\u00e1]], to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of [[Curu\u00e7\u00e1]], in the state of [[Par\u00e1]].\n\nA more conservative measurement excluding the Par\u00e1 river estuary, from the mouth of the [[Araguari River (Amap\u00e1)|Araguari River]] to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Maraj\u00f3, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over {{convert|180|km|mi}}. If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu\u00e1 (state of Amap\u00e1) and Jurupari (state of Par\u00e1), the width falls to about {{convert|15|km|mi}}.\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million square kilometres and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Bridges ===\nThere are no [[bridge]]s across the entire width of the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571466/Amazon_(river).html|title= Amazon (river)|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia|edition=2007|accessdate=12 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306073804/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571466/Amazon_%28river%29.html|archivedate=6 March 2008}}</ref> This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a [[ferry]], so there is no need to build a bridge. The [[Manaus Iranduba Bridge]] linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (a tributary of the Amazon).\n\n=== Dispute regarding length ===\n[[File:Amazon River Taxi.jpg|thumb|River taxi in Peru]]\n{{see also|Coastline paradox}}\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or [[Nile|the Nile]] is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.

Using the same techniques, they calculated the length of the Nile as {{convert|6853|km|mi}}, which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. They made it possible by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of ''Canal do Sul'' and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the ''R\u00edo Par\u00e1'' bay in its entire length.<ref name=britannica-amazon-length /><ref name=inpe /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070619-amazon-river.html |last=Roach |first=John |title=Amazon Longer Than Nile River, Scientists Say |date=18 June 2007 |website=National Geographic |accessdate=2 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815112238/http://animal.discovery.com/fish/river-monsters/candiru-catfish/ |archivedate=15 August 2012  }}</ref> [[Guido Gelli]], director of science at the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network [[Rede Globo|Globo]] in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.

A [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article, published in 2009, concluded that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of {{cvt|7088|km|mi}} for the Nile and {{cvt|6575|km|mi}} for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.<ref name=\"liu-etal-river-length\" />\nTherefore, as of 2018 the length of

From that point, Quebrada [[Carhuasanta]] emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms R\u00edo Lloqueta which becomes R\u00edo Hornillos and eventually joins the [[Apur\u00edmac River|R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac]].\n\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in ''[[Area (journal)|Area]]'', a peer-reviewed journal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the [[Mantaro River|R\u00edo Mantaro]] drainage.<ref name=\"ContosTripcevich\" /> A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur\u00edmac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the [[International Scale of River Difficulty|class IV\u2013V]] nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80&nbsp;km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80&nbsp;km longer than previously thought.

The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the [[salinity]] and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to {{cvt|2500000|km2}} in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.<ref name=smith />\n\nThe Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's [[sediment]]s out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.<ref name=Penn />\n\nThere is a natural water union between the Amazon and the [[Orinoco]] basins, the so-called [[Casiquiare canal]]. The Casiquiare is a river [[distributary]] of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]].\n\n=== Flooding ===\n[[File:Amazon-river-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]] satellite image of a flooded portion of the river]]\nNot all of the Amazon's tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June.

present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western [[Gondwana]]. 80 million years ago, the two continents split.  Fifteen million years ago, the main [[tectonic uplift]] phase of the Andean chain started.
