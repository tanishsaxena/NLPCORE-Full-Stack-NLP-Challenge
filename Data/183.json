This led him to develop his [[special theory of relativity]] during his time at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]] (1902\u20131909). He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields, and published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of laser, which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf|title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011.

In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name=Bio />\n\nThe Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich, from the age of 5, for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59\u201361]}}\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref>Barry R. Parker (2003). ''Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist'', Prometheus Books, p. 31</ref> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=30\u201331}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether theories|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field\".{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2001 |isbn=978-981-02-4985-4}}</ref>\n\nEinstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] at age 12.<ref>''The Three-body Problem from Pythagoras to Hawking'', Mauri Valtonen, Joanna Anosova, Konstantin Kholshevnikov, Aleksandr Myll\u00e4ri, Victor Orlov, Kiyotaka Tanikawa, (Springer 2016), p. 43, Simon and Schuster, 2008</ref> A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time \"[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\"<ref name=\"Einstein page 17\">''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', By Walter Isaacson, p. 17</ref> His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\".<ref name=\"Einstein page 17\"/> Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had \"mastered [[integral calculus|integral]] and [[differential calculus|differential]] [[calculus]]\".<ref>''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', By Walter Isaacson, p. 16</ref>\n\nAt age 13, Einstein was introduced to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: \"At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\"<ref name=\"Einstein page 17\"/>\n\nIn 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=36\u201337}} On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the [[Old cantonal school Aarau|Argovian cantonal school]] ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor [[Jost Winteler]], he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married Winteler's son Paul.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56\u201357}} In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship in the German Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military service]].{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|p=40}} In September 1896, he passed the Swiss [[Matura]] with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on [[Grading systems by country#Switzerland|a scale of 1\u20136]].{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), docs. 21\u201327}} At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland, for a teaching post.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56\u201357}}\n\nEinstein's future wife, a 20-year-old [[Serbs|Serbian]] woman [[Mileva Mari\u0107]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein's and Mari\u0107's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal Polytechnic teaching diploma.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 67}} There have been claims that Mari\u0107 collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers,<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Troemel-Ploetz, D. |title=Mileva Einstein-Mari\u0107: The Woman Who Did Einstein's Mathematics |journal=Women's Studies International Forum |date=1990 |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=415\u2013432 |doi=10.1016/0277-5395(90)90094-e}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n|url=http://philosci40.unibe.ch/lehre/winter99/einstein/Walker_Stachel.pdf |title=Did Einstein Espouse his Spouse's Ideas? |author=Walker, Evan Harris |date=February 1989 |journal=Physics Today |accessdate=19 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093653/http://philosci40.unibe.ch/lehre/winter99/einstein/Walker_Stachel.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> known as the [[Annus Mirabilis papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' papers]], but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=1\u201329}}<ref>Holton, G., ''Einstein, History, and Other Passions'', Harvard University Press, 1996, pp. 177\u2013193.</ref>{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA49 49\u201356]}}<ref>Martinez, A.

For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the [[Felix Adler (professor)#New York Society for Ethical Culture|New York Society for Ethical Culture]], he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism.

In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name=Bio />\n\nThe Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich, from the age of 5, for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59\u201361]}}\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref>Barry R. Parker (2003). ''Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist'', Prometheus Books, p. 31</ref> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=30\u201331}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether theories|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field\".{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2001 |isbn=978-981-02-4985-4}}</ref>\n\nEinstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] at age 12.<ref>''The Three-body Problem from Pythagoras to Hawking'', Mauri Valtonen, Joanna Anosova, Konstantin Kholshevnikov, Aleksandr Myll\u00e4ri, Victor Orlov, Kiyotaka Tanikawa, (Springer 2016), p. 43, Simon and Schuster, 2008</ref> A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time \"[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\"<ref name=\"Einstein page 17\">''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', By Walter Isaacson, p. 17</ref> His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\".<ref name=\"Einstein page 17\"/> Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had \"mastered [[integral calculus|integral]] and [[differential calculus|differential]] [[calculus]]\".<ref>''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', By Walter Isaacson, p. 16</ref>\n\nAt age 13, Einstein was introduced to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: \"At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\"<ref name=\"Einstein page 17\"/>\n\nIn 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=36\u201337}} On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the [[Old cantonal school Aarau|Argovian cantonal school]] ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor [[Jost Winteler]], he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married Winteler's son Paul.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56\u201357}} In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship in the German Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military service]].{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|p=40}} In September 1896, he passed the Swiss [[Matura]] with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on [[Grading systems by country#Switzerland|a scale of 1\u20136]].{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), docs. 21\u201327}} At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland, for a teaching post.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56\u201357}}\n\nEinstein's future wife, a 20-year-old [[Serbs|Serbian]] woman [[Mileva Mari\u0107]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein's and Mari\u0107's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.

Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Z\u00fcrich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others.

Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref>{{cite web |last=Levenson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ |title=Einstein's Big Idea |publisher=WBGH |type=public broadcaster website |via=NOVA by [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS)|location=Boston |date=9 September 1997 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n=== Special relativity ===\n{{Main|History of special relativity}}\nEinstein's \"''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper''\"{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}} (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between [[Maxwell's equations]] (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=178\u2013198}} Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nThis paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to [[Time dilation|slow down]], and the body itself would [[Length contraction|contract]] in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]\u2014one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time\u2014was superfluous.<ref group=note>In [[s:Translation:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|his paper]], Einstein wrote: \"The introduction of a 'luminiferous \u00e6ther' will be proved to be superfluous in so far, as according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce neither a 'space absolutely at rest' endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place.\"</ref>\n\nIn his paper on [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup> as a consequence of his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA215 215]}} Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref>For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F. Glick, ed., ''The Comparative Reception of Relativity'' (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1987), {{ISBN|90-277-2498-9}}.</ref>{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382\u2013386}}\n\nEinstein originally framed special relativity in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of [[spacetime]]. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n=== General relativity ===\n\n==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====\n{{Main|History of general relativity}}\n{{See also|Equivalence principle|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179\u2013183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900\u20131909|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\n====Gravitational waves====\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=N\u00e4herungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688\u2013696|bibcode=1916SPAW.......688E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=\u00dcber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154\u2013167|bibcode=1918SPAW.......154E }}</ref> ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.

By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\n\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].<ref name=\"natgeo\">{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160211-gravitational-waves-found-spacetime-science/ |title=Found!

He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref>van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p. 23.</ref> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n==== Physical cosmology ====\n{{Main|Physical cosmology}}\n\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285\u2013286}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=J.D.|title=The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931<ref name=\"einstein-1931\">Einstein, A. 1931.

[[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\n\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and others.\n\n==== Wormholes ====\n{{Main|Wormhole}}\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |author2=Rosen, Nathan |last-author-amp=yes |date=1935 |title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |page=73 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73 |bibcode=1935PhRv...48...73E}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2015 \u2013 General Relativity's Centennial|publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|date=2015|url=https://journals.aps.org/general-relativity-centennial|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\".

These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\n\n==== Einstein\u2013Cartan theory ====\n{{Main|Einstein\u2013Cartan theory}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n==== Equations of motion ====\n{{Main|Einstein\u2013Infeld\u2013Hoffmann equations}}\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law{{mdash}}the [[Einstein field equations]], which describe how space curves. The [[geodesic equation]], which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.\n\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\n\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\n\n=== Old quantum theory ===\n{{Main|Old quantum theory}}\n\n==== Photons and energy quanta ====\n[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\n{{Main|Photon|Quantum}}\nIn a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\n\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\n\n==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====\n{{Main|Einstein solid}}\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently\u2014a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein \"Solid Cold\". U.S. DOE.], [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], 2011.</ref>\n\n==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====\n{{main|Adiabatic invariant}}\nThroughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\n\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.\n\n==== Bose\u2013Einstein statistics ====\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein statistics}}\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\u2013[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics |date=9 October 2001 |accessdate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610080506/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Bose\u2013Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s.

In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In \"''\u00dcber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen \u00fcber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''\" (\"[[s:Translation:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]\"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave\u2013particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave\u2013particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n==== Zero-point energy ====\n{{Main|Zero-point energy}}\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912\u20131914|pp=270ff}}\n\n==== Stimulated emission ====\n{{main|Stimulated emission}}\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\n\n==== Matter waves ====\n{{main|Matter wave}}\nEinstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schr\u00f6dinger's work of 1926.\n\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\n==== Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics ====\n[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations |first1=Robert |last1=Andrews |publisher=Penguin UK |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-14-196531-4 |page=499 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC&pg=PT499}}</ref> Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pais|first1= Abraham|date= October 1979|title= Einstein and the quantum theory|url= http://ursula.chem.yale.edu/~batista/classes/vvv/RevModPhys.51.863.pdf|journal= Reviews of Modern Physics|volume= 51|issue= 4|pages= 863\u2013914|doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.51.863|bibcode= 1979RvMP...51..863P}}\n</ref>\n\n==== Bohr versus Einstein ====\n{{Main|Bohr\u2013Einstein debates}}\n[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed.

No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448\u2013453}}\n\nGiven Einstein's concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448\u2013453}}\n\nEinstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}\n\nAlthough Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|''entangled quantum states'']], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]]. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}\n\n=== Unified field theory ===\n{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}\nFollowing his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified field theory]]\" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\nIn his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\n\n=== Other investigations ===\n{{Main|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.\n\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n==== Einstein\u2013de Haas experiment ====\n{{Main|Einstein\u2013de Haas effect}}\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\n\n==== Schr\u00f6dinger gas model ====\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|Bose\u2013Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.\n\nThis formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schr\u00f6dinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moore |first=Walter |date=1989 |title=Schr\u00f6dinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43767-7}}</ref>\n\n==== Einstein refrigerator ====\n{{Main|Einstein refrigerator}}\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.<ref name=\"Goettling\">Goettling, Gary.

Retrieved on 12 November 2014. [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], a Hungarian physicist who later worked on the Manhattan Project, is credited with the discovery of the [[chain reaction]]</ref> On 11 November 1930, {{US patent|1781541}} was awarded to Einstein and Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]].<ref>In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled.{{Cite news | last = Alok | first = Jha | title = Einstein

According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179\u2013183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900\u20131909|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\n====Gravitational waves====\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=N\u00e4herungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688\u2013696|bibcode=1916SPAW.......688E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=\u00dcber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154\u2013167|bibcode=1918SPAW.......154E }}</ref> ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.

He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref>van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p. 23.</ref> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n==== Physical cosmology ====\n{{Main|Physical cosmology}}\n\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285\u2013286}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=J.D.|title=The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931<ref name=\"einstein-1931\">Einstein, A. 1931.

[[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\n\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and others.\n\n==== Wormholes ====\n{{Main|Wormhole}}\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |author2=Rosen, Nathan |last-author-amp=yes |date=1935 |title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |page=73 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73 |bibcode=1935PhRv...48...73E}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2015 \u2013 General Relativity's Centennial|publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|date=2015|url=https://journals.aps.org/general-relativity-centennial|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\".

According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179\u2013183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900\u20131909|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "History of general relativity"}]}, {"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Equivalence principle"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Theory of relativity"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Einstein field equations"}]}, {"name": "Sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Einstein"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1923"}]}, {"name": "Sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pais"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1982"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "179\u2013183"}]}, {"name": "Sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Stachel"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "loc", "value": "vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900\u20131909"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "273\u2013274"}]}, {"name": "Sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Pais"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1982"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "194\u2013195"}]}], "id": 27}, {"title": "Gravitational waves", "paragraphs": "In 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=N\u00e4herungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688\u2013696|bibcode=1916SPAW.......688E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=\u00dcber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154\u2013167|bibcode=1918SPAW.......154E }}</ref> ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.

No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448\u2013453}}\n\nGiven Einstein's concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448\u2013453}}\n\nEinstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}\n\nAlthough Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|''entangled quantum states'']], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]].

No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448\u2013453}}\n\nGiven Einstein's concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448\u2013453}}\n\nEinstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}\n\nAlthough Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|''entangled quantum states'']], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]].
