He was a younger contemporary of [[Phidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[Hephaestus]] and an [[Aphrodite of the Gardens|Aphrodite \"of the Gardens\"]] were conspicuous.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alcamenes|volume=1|pages=517\u2013518}}</ref>\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says<ref>''Description of Greece'' V. 10. 8</ref> that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Pausanias<ref>''Description of Greece'' I. 8. 4</ref> also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the [[Athenian agora]], which some have related to the [[Ares Borghese]].
