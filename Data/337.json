She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first [[algorithm]] intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \"[[computing machine]]\" and one of the first computer [[programmer]]s.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Ana Lena|date=November\u2013December 2011|title=Crowdsourcing Gender Equity: Ada Lovelace Day, and its companion website, aims to raise the profile of women in science and technology|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/crowdsourcing-gender-equity|journal=American Scientist|volume=99|issue=6|page=463}}</ref><ref name=\"Lovelace Google\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|date=10 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAugusta Byron was the only legitimate child of poet [[Lord Byron]] and his wife [[Lady Byron]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323|title=Ada Lovelace Biography|website=biography.com}}</ref> All of [[Lord Byron#Children|Byron's other children]] were born out of wedlock to other women.<ref name= ABCL/> Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later.

Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived [[insanity]]. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]].\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ventana al Conocimiento |url=https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/ada-lovelace-original-and-visionary-but-no-programmer/ |title=Ada Lovelace: Original and Visionary, but No Programmer |date=9 December 2015 }}</ref> Lovelace's notes are important in the early [[history of computers]].

She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation.

At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\n\n{{Quote|text=When Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the [[anatomy of birds]] to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, ''Flyology,'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>}}\n\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]]]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was [[debutante|presented at Court]] at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835, she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]], becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|title=Hon.

One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies.

She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Turing, Alan |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer [[algorithm]]]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University|year=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G.

In her notes, she wrote:\n{{Quote|[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides ''number'', were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lovelace|first1=Ada|last2=Menabrea|first2=Luigi|title=Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq.|year=1842|journal=[[Scientific Memoirs]]|publisher=Richard Taylor|page=694}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Rowan|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22385-ada-lovelace-my-brain-is-more-than-merely-mortal.html|title=Ada Lovelace: My brain is more than merely mortal|work=New Scientist|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. [[Walter Isaacson]] ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to ''any'' process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used [[punched cards|punchcards]] to direct the weaving of beautiful [[pattern]]s, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/ |title=Walter Isaacson on the Women of ENIAC |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |date=18 September 2014 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}</ref> This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer [[John Graham-Cumming]], whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=2\u20133, 14}}{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=272\u201377}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Leo|url=http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|title=The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine|publisher=Humans Invent|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123843/http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist [[Doron Swade]]: <blockquote>Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw\u2014what Ada Byron saw\u2014was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy over her actual contribution===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.

While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that \"there's nothing as sophisticated\u2014or as clean\u2014as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Doron Swade]], a specialist on [[history of computing]] known for his work on Babbage, analysed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine:\n#She was a mathematical genius\n#She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\n#She was the first computer programmer\n#She was a prophet of the computer age\n\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.<ref>{{cite speech |last=Swade |first=Doron |author-link=Doron Swade |title=Charles Babbage and Difference Engine No. 2 |event=Talks at Google |date=12 May 2008 |location=Mountain View, CA |publisher=Talks at Google via YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K5p_tBcrd0&t=36m29s |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "p", "value": "198"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "232\u201333"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "p", "value": "305"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "310\u201314"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "315\u201317"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "p", "value": "335"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Toole"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "36\u201338"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace/"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Stephen"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Wolfram"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Stephen Wolfram"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Untangling the Tale of Ada Lovelace"}, {"name": "date", "value": "10 December 2015"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "Then, on Sept. 9, Babbage wrote to Ada, expressing his admiration for her and (famously) describing her as 'Enchantress of Number' and 'my dear and much admired Interpreter'.

It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Toole"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "175\u201382"}]}, {"name": "Quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides ''number'', were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lovelace|first1=Ada|last2=Menabrea|first2=Luigi|title=Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq.|year=1842|journal=[[Scientific Memoirs]]|publisher=Richard Taylor|page=694}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Rowan|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22385-ada-lovelace-my-brain-is-more-than-merely-mortal.html|title=Ada Lovelace: My brain is more than merely mortal|work=New Scientist|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>"}]}, {"name": "cite journal", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Lovelace"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Ada"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Menabrea"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Luigi"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq."}, {"name": "year", "value": "1842"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "[[Scientific Memoirs]]"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Richard Taylor"}, {"name": "page", "value": "694"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Hooper"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Rowan"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22385-ada-lovelace-my-brain-is-more-than-merely-mortal.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ada Lovelace: My brain is more than merely mortal"}, {"name": "work", "value": "New Scientist"}, {"name": "date", "value": "16 October 2012"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "16 October 2012"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Walter Isaacson on the Women of ENIAC"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Isaacson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Walter"}, {"name": "date", "value": "18 September 2014"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Toole"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1998"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "2\u20133, 14"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Woolley"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "pp", "value": "272\u201377"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Kent"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Leo"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Humans Invent"}, {"name": "date", "value": "17 September 2012"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "16 October 2012"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123843/http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "14 October 2012"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "Sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Fuegi"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Francis"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2003"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Controversy over her actual contribution", "paragraphs": "Though Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.
