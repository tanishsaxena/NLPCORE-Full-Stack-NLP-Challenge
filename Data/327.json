The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands. In certain [[sensory neuron]]s ([[pseudounipolar neuron]]s), such as those for touch and warmth, the axons are called [[afferent nerve fiber]]s and the electrical impulse travels along these from the [[peripheral nervous system|periphery]] to the cell body, and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons. Nerve fibers are [[Axon#Classification|classed]] into three types \u2013 [[group A nerve fiber]]s, [[group B nerve fiber]]s, and [[group C nerve fiber]]s. Groups A and B are [[myelin]]ated, and group C are unmyelinated. These groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers. Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV.\n\nAn axon is one of two types of [[cytoplasm]]ic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron; the other type is a [[dendrite]]. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. In some species, axons can emanate from dendrites and these are known as axon-carrying dendrites.<ref name=\"Triarhou\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Triarhou LC | title = Axons emanating from dendrites: phylogenetic repercussions with Cajalian hues | journal = Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | volume = 8 | pages = 133 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25477788 | pmc = 4235383 | doi = 10.3389/fnana.2014.00133 }}</ref> No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yau KW | title = Receptive fields, geometry and conduction block of sensory neurones in the central nervous system of the leech | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 263 | issue = 3 | pages = 513\u201338 | date = December 1976 | pmid = 1018277 | pmc = 1307715 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011643 }}</ref>\n\nAxons are covered by a membrane known as an [[axolemma]]; the cytoplasm of an axon is called [[axoplasm]]. Most axons branch, in some cases very profusely. The end branches of an axon are called [[Axon#Axon terminals|telodendria]]. The swollen end of a telodendron is known as the [[axon terminal]] which joins the dendron or cell body of another neuron forming a synaptic connection. Axons make contact with other cells\u2014usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells\u2014at junctions called [[synapse]]s. In some circumstances, the axon of one neuron may form a synapse with the dendrites of the same neuron, resulting in an [[autapse]]. At a synapse, the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap. Some synaptic junctions appear along the length of an axon as it extends\u2014these are called ''en passant'' (\"in passing\") synapses and can be in the hundreds or even the thousands along one axon.<ref name=\"LS\">{{cite book|last1=Squire|first1=Larry|title=Fundamental neuroscience|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-385-870-2|pages=61\u201365|edition=4th}}</ref> Other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches.\n\nA single axon, with all its branches taken together, can [[innervate]] multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals.

Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spinal cord]] to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one [[micrometre|micrometer]] (\u00b5m) across). The largest mammalian axons can reach a diameter of up to 20&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[squid giant axon]], which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly, is close to 1 [[millimetre]] in diameter, the size of a small pencil lead. The numbers of axonal telodendria (the branching structures at the end of the axon) can also differ from one nerve fiber to the next. Axons in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) typically show multiple telodendria, with many synaptic end points. In comparison, the [[cerebellar granule cell]] axon is characterized by a single T-shaped branch node from which two [[parallel fiber]]s extend. Elaborate branching allows for the simultaneous transmission of messages to a large number of target neurons within a single region of the brain.\n\nThere are two types of axons in the [[nervous system]]: [[myelin]]ated and [[unmyelinated]] axons.<ref name=\"Debanne\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Debanne D, Campanac E, Bialowas A, Carlier E, Alcaraz G | title = Axon physiology | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 555\u2013602 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21527732 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00048.2009 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e063679c643aac5742929e9468e1988f8b395f1e }}</ref> [[Myelin]] is a layer of a fatty insulating substance, which is formed by two types of [[neuroglia|glial cells]] [[Schwann cell]]s and [[oligodendrocyte]]s.

Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the myelin sheath known as [[myelin sheath gap|nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly spaced intervals. The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction]].\n\nThe myelinated axons from the [[cerebral cortex|cortical neurons]] form the bulk of the neural tissue called [[white matter]] in the brain. The myelin gives the white appearance to the [[Neural tissue|tissue]] in contrast to the [[grey matter]] of the cerebral cortex which contains the neuronal cell bodies. A similar arrangement is seen in the [[cerebellum]]. Bundles of myelinated axons make up the [[nerve tract]]s in the CNS. Where these tracts cross the midline of the brain to connect opposite regions they are called ''commissures''.

At the end of each '''telodendron''' is an [[axon terminal]] (also called a synaptic bouton, or terminal bouton). Axon terminals contain [[synaptic vesicle]]s that store the [[neurotransmitter]] for release at the [[Chemical synapse|synapse]]. This makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible. Sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron, when it is known as an [[autapse]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Debanne D, Campanac E, Bialowas A, Carlier E, Alcaraz G"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Axon physiology"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Physiological Reviews"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "91"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "555\u2013602"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 2011"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "21527732"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1152/physrev.00048.2009"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e063679c643aac5742929e9468e1988f8b395f1e"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Nelson AD, Jenkins PM"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Axonal Membranes and Their Domains: Assembly and Function of the Axon Initial Segment and Node of Ranvier"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "11"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "136"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2017"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "28536506"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "5422562"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.3389/fncel.2017.00136"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Leterrier C, Clerc N, Rueda-Boroni F, Montersino A, Dargent B, Castets F"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ankyrin G Membrane Partners Drive the Establishment and Maintenance of the Axon Initial Segment"}, {"name": "language", "value": "English"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "11"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "6"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2017"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "28184187"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "5266712"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.3389/fncel.2017.00006"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Leterrier C"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Axon Initial Segment: An Updated Viewpoint"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "The Journal of Neuroscience"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "38"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "9"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "2135\u20132145"}, {"name": "date", "value": "February 2018"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "29378864"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "6596274"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1523/jneurosci.1922-17.2018"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "vauthors", "value": "Rasband MN"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The axon initial segment and the maintenance of neuronal polarity"}, {"name": "language", "value": "En"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Nature Reviews.

Axon terminals contain [[synaptic vesicle]]s that store the [[neurotransmitter]] for release at the [[Chemical synapse|synapse]]. This makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible. Sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron, when it is known as an [[autapse]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 8}, {"title": "Action potentials", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Action potential}}\n{{Further |Neural coding|Active zone}}\n{{Synapse map}}\nMost axons carry signals in the form of [[action potential]]s, which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes [[chemical synapse|synaptic]] contact with target cells. The defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is \"all-or-nothing\"&nbsp;\u2014 every action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape. This all-or-nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size. There are, however, some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals, of variable amplitude.\n\nWhen an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it activates the synaptic transmission process. The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes [[synaptic vesicle]]s (tiny containers enclosed by a lipid membrane) filled with a [[neurotransmitter]] chemical to fuse with the axon's membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space. The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through [[exocytosis]]. The neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell. The neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them. Depending on the type of receptors that are activated, the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell, inhibit it, or alter its metabolism in some way. This entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second. Afterward, inside the presynaptic terminal, a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane, ready to be released when the next action potential arrives. The action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron.<ref name=\"Debanne\"/>\n\n[[File:Example of Waveforms from Extracellular Tetrode Recordings in the Hippocampus from Different Cell Types and Axons.tif|thumb|(A) pyramidal cell, interneuron, and short durationwaveform (Axon), overlay of the three average waveforms;<br />(B) Average and standard error of peak-trough time for pyramidal cells interneurons, and putative axons;<br />(C) Scatter plot of signal to noise ratios for individual units againstpeak-trough time for axons, pyramidal cells (PYR) and interneurons (INT).]]\n\nExtracellular recordings of [[action potential]] propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals. While extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as [[place cells]], axonal activity in both [[White matter|white]] and [[gray matter]] can also be recorded. Extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways: 1. The signal has a shorter peak-trough duration (~150\u03bcs) than of pyramidal cells (~500\u03bcs) or interneurons (~250\u03bcs). 2. The voltage change is triphasic. 3.

[[Joseph Erlanger|Erlanger]] and [[Herbert Spencer Gasser|Gasser]] proved this hypothesis, and identified several types of nerve fiber, establishing a relationship between the diameter of an axon and its [[nerve conduction velocity]]. They published their findings in 1941 giving the first classification of axons.\n\nAxons are classified in two systems. The first one introduced by Erlanger and Gasser, grouped the fibers into three main groups using the letters A, B, and C. These groups, [[group A nerve fiber|group A]], [[group B nerve fibres|group B]], and [[group C nerve fiber|group C]] include both the sensory fibers ([[afferent nerve fiber|afferents]]) and the motor fibres ([[efferent nerve fiber|efferents]]).

These were then introduced into a system that only included sensory fibers (though some of these were mixed nerves and were also motor fibers). This system refers to the sensory groups as Types and uses Roman numerals: Type Ia, Type Ib, Type II, Type III, and Type IV.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Motor}} === <!-- Motor fiber types redirects here -->\n[[Lower motor neurons]] have two kind of fibers:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Motor fiber types\n|-\n!
