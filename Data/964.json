The [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]] aircraft serving the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by five Saudi men affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]] on September 11, 2001, as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. They deliberately crashed the plane into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.\n\nLess than 35&nbsp;minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.\n\nThe hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas that August. The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the [[Pentagon Memorial]] adjacent to the crash site. The {{convert|1.93|acre|m2|adj=on}} park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth, ranging from 1930 to 1998.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "9/11 hijacked passenger flight, hit the Pentagon"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox aircraft occurrence\n", "values": [{"name": "occurrence_type", "value": "Hijacking"}, {"name": "name", "value": "American Airlines Flight 77"}, {"name": "image", "value": "File:Flightpath-AA77.gif"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "AAL77 flight path from [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]]<br />to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "{{start-date|Tuesday, September 11, 2001}}"}, {"name": "type", "value": "[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] [[Suicide attack|suicide]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]"}, {"name": "site", "value": "West wall of [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], [[Virginia]], U.S."}, {"name": "total_fatalities", "value": "189"}, {"name": "fatalities", "value": "64 (including 5 hijackers)"}, {"name": "ground_fatalities", "value": "125 (including emergency workers) at the Pentagon"}, {"name": "ground_injuries", "value": "106"}, {"name": "aircraft_type", "value": "[[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]]"}, {"name": "origin", "value": "[[Washington Dulles International Airport]]"}, {"name": "destination", "value": "[[Los Angeles International Airport]]"}, {"name": "operator", "value": "[[American Airlines]]"}, {"name": "IATA", "value": "AA77"}, {"name": "ICAO", "value": "AAL77"}, {"name": "callsign", "value": "AMERICAN 77"}, {"name": "tail_number", "value": "N644AA"}, {"name": "passengers", "value": "58 (including 5 hijackers)"}, {"name": "crew", "value": "6"}, {"name": "survivors", "value": "0"}]}, {"name": "start-date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Tuesday, September 11, 2001"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1.93"}, {"name": "2", "value": "acre"}, {"name": "3", "value": "m2"}, {"name": "adj", "value": "on"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Hijackers", "paragraphs": "The hijackers on American Airlines Flight&nbsp;77 were led by [[Hani Hanjour]], who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon.<ref name=\"NYTimes1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/18/us/nation-challenged-suspect-man-traveled-across-us-his-quest-be-pilot.html |title=A Nation Challenged: The Suspect \u2013 Man Traveled Across U.S. In His Quest to Be a Pilot |author=David W.
