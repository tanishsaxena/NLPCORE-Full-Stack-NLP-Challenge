Following the death of his older brother, Infante Jo\u00e3o (1429-1433), Afonso acceded to the position of heir apparent and was made the first [[Prince of Portugal]] by his father, who sought to emulate the English Court's custom of a dynastic title that distinguished the heir apparent from the other children of the monarch. He was only six years old when he succeeded his father in 1438.<ref name=Gerli>Livermore, H.V., \"Afonso V\", ''Medieval Iberia'', E. Michael Gerli, and Samuel G.

As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. Opposition rose and without any important ally among the Portuguese aristocracy other than [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]], the illegitimate half brother of King Edward, the queen's position was untenable. In 1439, the [[Portuguese Cortes]] (assembly of the kingdom) decided to replace the queen with [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]] (Dom Pedro),<ref name=EB1911/> the young king's oldest uncle.<ref name=Gerli/>\n\nPeter's main policies were concerned with restricting the political power of the great noble houses and expanding the powers of the crown. The country prospered under his rule, but not peacefully, as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles. The count of Barcelos, a personal enemy of the Duke of Coimbra (despite being half-brothers) eventually became the king's favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power. In 1442, the king made Afonso the first [[Duke of Braganza]]. With this title and its lands, he became the most powerful man in Portugal and one of the richest men in Europe. To secure his position as regent, Peter had Afonso marry his daughter, [[Isabella of Coimbra]], in 1445.<ref name=Gerli/>\n\nBut on 9 June 1448, when the king came of age, Peter had to surrender his power to Afonso V.  The years of conspiracy by the Duke of Braganza finally came to a head. On 15 September of the same year, Afonso V nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency. In the following year, led by what were later discovered to be false accusations, Afonso declared Peter a rebel and defeated his army in the [[Battle of Alfarrobeira]], in which his uncle (and father-in-law) was killed.<ref name=EB1911/> After this battle and the loss of one of Portugal's most remarkable infantes, the Duke of Braganza became the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "9780415939188"}]}, {"name": "cite EB1911", "values": [{"name": "wstitle", "value": "Alphonso"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Invasion of Morocco", "paragraphs": "{{further information|Morocco-Portugal relations}}\n[[File:Landing at Asilah.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Conquest of Asilah|Conquest of Arzila]] in 1471]]\nAfonso V then turned his attentions to North Africa. In the reign of his grandfather [[John I of Portugal|John I]], [[Ceuta]] had been conquered from the king of [[Morocco]], and now the new king wanted to expand the conquests. The king's army conquered [[Alc\u00e1cer Ceguer]] in 1458 and [[Conquest of Arzila|Arzila]] in 1471. [[Tangiers]], on the other hand, was won and lost several times between 1460 and 1464. These achievements granted the king the nickname of ''the African'' or ''Africano''.<ref name=EB1911/> The king also supported the exploration of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] led by prince [[Henry the Navigator]] but after Henry's death in 1460, he did nothing to continue Henry's work. Administratively, Afonso V was a passive king. He chose not to pursue the revision of laws or development of commerce, preferring instead to preserve the legacy of his father Edward and grandfather [[John I of Portugal|John I]].\n\nIn 1452, [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', which granted Afonso V the right to reduce \"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers\" to hereditary slavery. This was reaffirmed and extended in the [[Romanus Pontifex]] bull of 1455 (also by Nicholas V). These papal bulls came to be seen by some as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and European colonialism.\n\n[[File:FraMauroDetailedMapInverted.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of the [[Fra Mauro map]] was made under a commission by Afonso V in 1457.

However, her paternity was questioned; it was rumored that his wife, Queen [[Joan of Portugal]] had an affair with a nobleman named [[Beltr\u00e1n de La Cueva]]. The death of Henry ignited a [[War of the Castilian Succession|war of succession]] with one faction supporting Joanna and the other supporting [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]], Henry's half-sister. Afonso V was persuaded to intervene on behalf of Joanna, his niece. He betrothed himself to her, proclaimed himself king of Castile and led troops into the kingdom.

(...). The Portuguese, however, later managed to recover the banner.
