He invented the [[Voltaic pile]] in 1799, and reported the results of his experiments in 1800 in a two-part letter to the President of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"ieeeghn\" /><ref name=\"royal\" /> With this invention Volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings. Volta's invention sparked a great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments which eventually led to the development of the field of [[electrochemistry]].<ref name=\"royal\" />\n\nVolta also drew admiration from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] for his invention, and was invited to the [[Institute of France]] to demonstrate his invention to the members of the Institute. Volta enjoyed a certain amount of closeness with the emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him.<ref name=\"munro\" /> Volta held the chair of experimental physics at the [[University of Pavia]] for nearly 40 years and was widely idolised by his students.<ref name=\"munro\" />\n\nDespite his professional success, Volta tended to be a person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years. At this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in 1827 from a series of illnesses which began in 1823.<ref name=\"munro\" /> The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[electric potential]] is named in his honour as the [[volt]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "For", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the concept car"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Toyota Alessandro Volta"}]}, {"name": "pp-pc1", "values": [{"name": "small", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Italian physicist, chemist, and pioneer of electricity"}]}, {"name": "more citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2018"}]}, {"name": "use British English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2015"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2015"}]}, {"name": "Infobox scientist\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Alessandro Volta"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alessandro Volta.jpeg"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date|1745|2|18|df=yes}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Como]], [[Duchy of Milan]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|1827|3|5|1745|2|18|df=y}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Como]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]]"}, {"name": "nationality", "value": "Italian"}, {"name": "known_for", "value": "{{plainlist|\n* Invention of the [[Battery (electricity)|electric cell]]\n* Discovery of [[methane]]\n* [[Volt]]\n* [[Voltage]]\n* [[Voltmeter]]\n}}"}, {"name": "awards", "value": "{{plainlist|\n* [[Copley Medal]] (1794)\n* [[Legion of Honour]]<ref name=\"munro\" />\n* [[Order of the Iron Crown]]<ref name=\"munro\" />\n}}"}, {"name": "honorific_prefix", "value": "[[Count]]"}, {"name": "field", "value": "[[Physics]] and [[chemistry]]"}]}, {"name": "birth date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1745"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "18"}, {"name": "df", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "death date and age", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1827"}, {"name": "2", "value": "3"}, {"name": "3", "value": "5"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1745"}, {"name": "5", "value": "2"}, {"name": "6", "value": "18"}, {"name": "df", "value": "y"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "* Invention of the [[Battery (electricity)|electric cell]]\n* Discovery of [[methane]]\n* [[Volt]]\n* [[Voltage]]\n* [[Voltmeter]]"}]}, {"name": "plainlist", "values": [{"name": "* [[Copley Medal]] (1794)\n* [[Legion of Honour]]<ref name", "value": "\"munro\" />\n* [[Order of the Iron Crown]]<ref name=\"munro\" />"}]}, {"name": "IPA-it", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ales\u02c8sandro \u02c8v\u0254lta"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lang"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " Early life and works ", "paragraphs": "Volta was born in [[Como]], a town in present-day northern [[Italy]], on 18 February 1745. In 1794, Volta married an aristocratic lady also from Como, Teresa Peregrini, with whom he raised three sons: Zanino, Flaminio, and Luigi. His father, Filippo Volta, was of noble lineage. His mother, Donna Maddalena, came from the family of the Inzaghis.<ref name=\"lifeworks\" />\n\nIn 1774, he became a professor of physics at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularised the [[electrophorus]], a device that produced [[static electricity]]. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the Swedish experimenter [[Johan Wilcke]].<ref name=\"pancaldi\" /><ref name=\"wilcke\" /> In 1777, he travelled through Switzerland. There he befriended [[H. B. de Saussure]].\n\nIn the years between 1776 and 1778, Volta studied the [[chemistry]] of gases. He researched and discovered [[methane]] after reading a paper by [[Benjamin Franklin]] of the United States on \"flammable air\". In November 1776, he found methane at [[Lake Maggiore]],<ref name=\"marsh\" /> and by 1778 he managed to isolate methane.<ref name=\"methane\" /> He devised experiments such as the [[combustion|ignition]] of methane by an electric [[Electrostatic discharge|spark]] in a closed vessel.\n\nVolta also studied what we now call electrical [[capacitance]], developing separate means to study both electrical potential (''V'') and charge (''Q''), and discovering that for a given object, they are proportional.<ref name=\"williams\" /> This is called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the [[volt]].<ref name=\"williams\" />\n\nIn 1779 he became a professor of experimental physics at the [[University of Pavia]], a chair that he occupied for almost 40 years.<ref name=\"munro\" />\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": " Volta and Galvani ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Luigi Galvani, oil-painting.jpg|thumb|[[Luigi Galvani]], Volta's rival]]\n[[Luigi Galvani]], an Italian physicist, discovered something he named, \"animal electricity\" when two different metals were connected in series with a frog's leg and to one another. Volta realised that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an [[electrolyte]]) and as a detector of electricity. He also understood that the frog's legs were irrelevant to the [[electric current]], which was caused by the two differing metals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Price |first=Derek deSolla |title=On the Brink of Tomorrow: Frontiers of Science |date=1982 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington D.C. |pp=16\u201317}}</ref> He replaced the frog's leg with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies.\nIn this way he discovered the [[electrochemical series]], and the law that the [[electromotive force]] (emf) of a [[galvanic cell]], consisting of a pair of metal [[electrode]]s separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials (thus, two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf). This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series.\n\nIn 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, Volta invented the [[voltaic pile]], an early [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]], which produced a steady electric current.<ref name=\"routledge\" /> Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was [[zinc]] and [[copper]]. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with [[brine]] into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Price"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Derek deSolla"}, {"name": "title", "value": "On the Brink of Tomorrow: Frontiers of Science"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1982"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "National Geographic Society"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Washington D.C."}, {"name": "pp", "value": "16\u201317"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": " Early battery ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Voltaic pile.svg|thumb|A [[voltaic pile]]]]\nIn announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile, Volta paid tribute to the influences of [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Tiberius Cavallo]], and [[Abraham Bennet]].<ref name=\"elliott\" />\n\nThe battery made by Volta is credited as one of the first electrochemical cells. It consists of two electrodes: one made of [[zinc]], the other of [[copper]]. The [[electrolyte]] is either [[sulfuric acid]] mixed with water or a form of saltwater [[brine]]. The electrolyte exists in the form 2H<sup>+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>. The zinc, which is higher in the [[standard electrode potential (data page)|electrochemical series]] than both copper and hydrogen, reacts with the negatively charged sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>). The positively charged hydrogen ions ([[proton]]s) capture [[electron]]s from the copper, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H<sub>2</sub>. This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode.\nThus, there are two terminals, and an electric current will flow if they are connected. The [[chemical reaction]]s in this voltaic cell are as follows:\n\n:Zinc:\n::Zn <big><big>\u2192</big></big> Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n:Sulfuric acid:\n::2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> <big><big>\u2192</big></big> H<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe copper does not react, but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current.\nHowever, this cell also has some disadvantages. It is unsafe to handle, since sulfuric acid, even if diluted, can be hazardous. Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released. Instead, it accumulates on the surface of the copper electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 3}, {"title": " Last years and retirement ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|Volta explains the principle of the ''\"electric column\"'' to [[Napoleon]] in 1801]]\n\nIn 1809 Volta became associated member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute of the Netherlands]].<ref name=\"dwc\" /> In honour of his work, Volta was made a count by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1810.<ref name=\"pancaldi\" />\n\nVolta retired in 1819 to his estate in Camnago, a [[frazione]] of [[Como, Italy]], now named \"Camnago Volta\" in his honour.
