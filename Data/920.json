For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped {{IPA|[\u027e&#771;]}} as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|[ . ]}} and {{IPA|[\u0279]}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0283\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThese descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.\n\n=== Rules for English Consonant Allophones ===\n\n[[Peter Ladefoged]], a renowned [[phonetics|phonetician]], clearly explains the [[consonant]] [[allophones]] of [[language|English]] in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant. \nThese descriptive rules are as follows<ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2001). A Course in Phonetics (4th ed.). Orlando: Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15-507319-2}}. p. 56-60.</ref>:\n# Consonants are longer when at the end of a phrase. This can be easily tested by recording a speaker saying a sound like \u201cbib\u201d, then comparing the forward and backward playback of the recording. One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.\n# [[Voicelessness|Voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like \"pip, test, kick\" {{IPA|[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]}}. You can compare this with voiceless stops that are not [[syllable]] initial like \"stop\" [st\u0251p]. The {{IPA|/t/}} voiceless stop follows the {{IPA|/s/}} (fricative) here.\n# [[voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[obstruents]], which include stops and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], such as {{IPA|/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/}}, that come at the end of an utterance like {{IPA|/v/}} in \"improve\" or before a voiceless sound like {{IPA|/d/}} in \"add two\") are only briefly voiced during the articulation.\n# Voiced stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} in fact occur as voiceless at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.\n# [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]] (in English, these include {{IPA|/w,r,j,l/}}) are partially voiceless when they occur after syllable-initial {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} like in \"play, twin, cue\" {{IPA|[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]}}.\n# Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words \"spew, stew, skew.\"\n# Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p,t,k,t\u0283/}} are longer than their voiced counterparts {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing \"cap\" to \"cab\" or \"back\" to \"bag\".\n# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like \"apt\" {{IPA|[\u00e6p\u031at]}} and \"rubbed\" {{IPA|[r\u028cb\u031ad]}}.\n# Many English accents produce a [[glottal stop]] in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of \"tip, pit, kick\" {{IPA|[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]}}.\n# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a {{IPA|/t/}} when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word \"beaten\" {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]}}.\n# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words \"leaden, chasm\" {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]}}. Take in comparison \"kiln, film\"; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}}, however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in \"paddle, whistle\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]}}. \n## When considering {{IPA|/r,l/}} as [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], {{IPA|/r/}} is included in this rule as well as present in the words \"sabre, razor, hammer, tailor\" {{IPA|[\u02c8se\u026abr\u0329, \u02c8re\u026azr\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6mr\u0329, \u02c8te\u026alr\u0329]}}.\n# [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|Alveolar stops]] become [[Dental and alveolar taps and flaps|voiced taps]] when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like \"fatty, data, daddy, many\" {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]}}.\n## When an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar nasals|alveolar nasal]] is followed by a stop, the {{IPA|/t/}} is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing \"winter\" to sound just like \"winner\" or \"panting\" to sound just like \"panning\". In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.\n# All alveolar consonants assimilate to [[Dental consonant|dentals]] when occurring before a dental. Take the words \"eighth, tenth, wealth\". This also applies across word boundaries, for example \"at this\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]}}.\n# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include \"most people\" (can be written either as {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], where the {{IPA|[t]}} is inaudible, and \"sand paper, grand master\", where the {{IPA|[d]}} is inaudible.\n# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in \"big game\" or \"top post\".\n# A [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] voiceless stop may be inserted after a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p/}} can be detected in the word \"something\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]}} even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as [[epenthesis]]. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.\n# Velar stops {{IPA|/k,g/}} become more [[Front and back|front]] when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance \"cap\" {{IPA|[k\u00e6p]}} vs. \"key\" {{IPA|[ki]}} and \"gap\" {{IPA|[g\u00e6p]}} vs. \"geese\" {{IPA|gis]}}.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarization|velarized]] at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant.

vowels}}\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a string explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped {{IPA|[\u027e&#771;]}} as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|[ . ]}} and {{IPA|[\u0279]}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0283\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThese descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "English phonology#Allophones of consonants"}, {"name": "2", "value": "English phonology#Allophones of vowels"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p, t, k/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[p\u02b0]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[p]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p, t, k/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t, d, n, l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/r/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[ t\u031a]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[t\u02b0]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u0294]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u027e]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u027e&#771;]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[t]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[ . ]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u0279]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0283\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t\u02b0/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[l]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8li\u02d0f]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u026b]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/\u026b/"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": " Rules for English Consonant Allophones ", "paragraphs": "\n[[Peter Ladefoged]], a renowned [[phonetics|phonetician]], clearly explains the [[consonant]] [[allophones]] of [[language|English]] in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior.

One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.\n# [[Voicelessness|Voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like \"pip, test, kick\" {{IPA|[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]}}. You can compare this with voiceless stops that are not [[syllable]] initial like \"stop\" [st\u0251p]. The {{IPA|/t/}} voiceless stop follows the {{IPA|/s/}} (fricative) here.\n# [[voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[obstruents]], which include stops and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], such as {{IPA|/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/}}, that come at the end of an utterance like {{IPA|/v/}} in \"improve\" or before a voiceless sound like {{IPA|/d/}} in \"add two\") are only briefly voiced during the articulation.\n# Voiced stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} in fact occur as voiceless at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.\n# [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]] (in English, these include {{IPA|/w,r,j,l/}}) are partially voiceless when they occur after syllable-initial {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} like in \"play, twin, cue\" {{IPA|[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]}}.\n# Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words \"spew, stew, skew.\"\n# Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p,t,k,t\u0283/}} are longer than their voiced counterparts {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing \"cap\" to \"cab\" or \"back\" to \"bag\".\n# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like \"apt\" {{IPA|[\u00e6p\u031at]}} and \"rubbed\" {{IPA|[r\u028cb\u031ad]}}.\n# Many English accents produce a [[glottal stop]] in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of \"tip, pit, kick\" {{IPA|[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]}}.\n# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a {{IPA|/t/}} when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word \"beaten\" {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]}}.\n# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words \"leaden, chasm\" {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]}}. Take in comparison \"kiln, film\"; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}}, however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in \"paddle, whistle\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]}}. \n## When considering {{IPA|/r,l/}} as [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], {{IPA|/r/}} is included in this rule as well as present in the words \"sabre, razor, hammer, tailor\" {{IPA|[\u02c8se\u026abr\u0329, \u02c8re\u026azr\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6mr\u0329, \u02c8te\u026alr\u0329]}}.\n# [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|Alveolar stops]] become [[Dental and alveolar taps and flaps|voiced taps]] when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like \"fatty, data, daddy, many\" {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]}}.\n## When an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar nasals|alveolar nasal]] is followed by a stop, the {{IPA|/t/}} is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing \"winter\" to sound just like \"winner\" or \"panting\" to sound just like \"panning\". In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.\n# All alveolar consonants assimilate to [[Dental consonant|dentals]] when occurring before a dental. Take the words \"eighth, tenth, wealth\". This also applies across word boundaries, for example \"at this\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]}}.\n# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include \"most people\" (can be written either as {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], where the {{IPA|[t]}} is inaudible, and \"sand paper, grand master\", where the {{IPA|[d]}} is inaudible.\n# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in \"big game\" or \"top post\".\n# A [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] voiceless stop may be inserted after a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p/}} can be detected in the word \"something\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]}} even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as [[epenthesis]]. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.\n# Velar stops {{IPA|/k,g/}} become more [[Front and back|front]] when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance \"cap\" {{IPA|[k\u00e6p]}} vs. \"key\" {{IPA|[ki]}} and \"gap\" {{IPA|[g\u00e6p]}} vs. \"geese\" {{IPA|gis]}}.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarization|velarized]] at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant. Compare for example \"life\" {{IPA|[la\u026af]}} vs. \"file\" {{IPA|[fa\u026a\u026b]}} or \"feeling\" {{IPA|[fi\u02d0l\u026a\u014b]}} vs. \"feel\" {{IPA|[fi\u02d0\u026b]}}.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-15-507319-2"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p,t,k/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/s/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/v/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/d/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/b,d,g,d\u0292/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/w,r,j,l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p,t,k/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p,t,k/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p,t,k,t\u0283/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/b,d,g,d\u0292/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u00e6p\u031at]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[r\u028cb\u031ad]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/r,l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/r/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8se\u026abr\u0329, \u02c8re\u026azr\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6mr\u0329, \u02c8te\u026alr\u0329]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/t/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[t]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[d]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/p/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/k,g/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[k\u00e6p]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[ki]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[g\u00e6p]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "gis]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "/l/"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[la\u026af]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[fa\u026a\u026b]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[fi\u02d0l\u026a\u014b]"}]}, {"name": "IPA", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[fi\u02d0\u026b]"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Other languages", "paragraphs": "There are many examples for allophones in languages other than English.

When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [\u014b].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=Mark |title=Marshallese phonology, the phonetics-phonology interface and historical linguistics |journal=The Linguistic Review |date=2000 |volume=17 |issue=2-4 |page=241-258}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Hale"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Mark"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Marshallese phonology, the phonetics-phonology interface and historical linguistics"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "The Linguistic Review"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "17"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2-4"}, {"name": "page", "value": "241-258"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "See also", "paragraphs": "*[[Allo-]]\n*[[Allophonic rule]]\n*[[Allomorph]]\n*[[Alternation (linguistics)]]\n*[[Diaphoneme]]\n*[[List of phonetics topics]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "{{Reflist}}\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 10}, {"title": " External links ", "paragraphs": "* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212012436/http://www.elloandfriends.uni-osnabrueck.de/wikis/1/show?n=PhoneticsandPhonology.PhonemesAndAllophones Phonemes and allophones]\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]", "attributes": [], "id": 11}]}
