But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be [[wiktionary:convertible#Adjective|convertible]], then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.\n</blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Mathematical analysis"}]}], "id": 11}, {"title": "Music", "paragraphs": "* [[Musical analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a process attempting to answer the question \"How does this music work?\"\n* [[Schenkerian analysis]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 12}, {"title": "Philosophy", "paragraphs": "* [[Philosophical analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a general term for the techniques used by philosophers\n* ''[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]'' is the name of a prominent journal in philosophy.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 13}, {"title": "Psychotherapy", "paragraphs": "* [[Psychoanalysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 seeks to elucidate connections among unconscious components of patients' mental processes\n* [[Transactional analysis]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 14}, {"title": "Public Policy", "paragraphs": "* [[Policy Analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 The use of statistical data to predict the effects of policy decisions made by governments and agencies\n* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative Analysis]]\u2013 The use of anecdotal evidence to predict the effects of policy decisions or, more generally, influence policy decisions\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 15}, {"title": "Signal processing", "paragraphs": "* [[Finite element analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a computer simulation technique used in engineering analysis\n* [[Independent component analysis]]\n* [[Link quality analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 the analysis of signal quality\n* [[Path quality analysis]]\n* [[Fourier analysis]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 16}, {"title": "Statistics", "paragraphs": "In [[statistics]], the term ''analysis'' may refer to any method used\nfor [[data analysis]].
