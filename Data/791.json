He was initially under the regency of his mother, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]], until 1662, when he removed her to a convent and took power with the help of his favourite, the [[Lu\u00eds de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor|Count of Castelo Melhor]].\n\nAfonso's reign saw the end of the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] (1640\u201368) and Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence. He also negotiated a French alliance through his marriage. However, the king was physically and mentally weak. In 1668, his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]] conspired to have him declared incapable of ruling, and took supreme ''de facto'' power as regent, although nominally Afonso was still sovereign. Queen [[Maria Francisca of Savoy|Marie Fran\u00e7oise]], Afonso's wife, received an annulment and subsequently married Pedro. Afonso spent the rest of his life and reign practically a prisoner.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2013"}]}, {"name": "More citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "March 2017"}]}, {"name": "Infobox royalty\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Afonso VI"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Afonso VI de Portugal.JPG"}, {"name": "image_size", "value": "180px"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "''D.
