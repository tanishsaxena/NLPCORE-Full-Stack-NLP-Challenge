It is located in the south-east of the country and is an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the state of [[New South Wales]]. Founded after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] as the seat of government for the new nation, all important institutions of the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] are centred in the territory.\n\nOn 1 January 1901, [[Federation of Australia|federation of the colonies]] of Australia was achieved. Section 125 of the new [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that land, situated in New South Wales and at least {{convert|100|miles|km|abbr=}} from [[Sydney]], would be ceded to the new [[Government of Australia|federal government]]. Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales, the ''[[Seat of Government Act 1908]]'' was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of the population reside in the city of [[Canberra]] in the ACT's north-east, the territory also includes some surrounding townships such as [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]]. The ACT also includes the [[Namadgi National Park]] which comprises the majority of land area of the territory. Despite a common misconception, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] is not part of the ACT although the laws of the Australian Capital Territory apply as if Jervis Bay did form part of the ACT.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx|title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration|website=Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters.\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. This includes the [[Parliament of Australia]], the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] and the [[Australian War Memorial]]. It also hosts the majority of foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations. Several major universities also have campuses in the ACT including the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Charles Sturt University]] and the [[Australian Catholic University]].\n\nA locally elected legislative assembly has governed the territory since 1988. However, the Commonwealth maintains authority over the territory and may overturn local laws. It still maintains control over the area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] through the [[National Capital Authority]]. Residents of the territory elect three members to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and two Senators to the [[Australian Senate]].\n\nWith 423,800 residents, the Australian Capital Territory is the second smallest mainland state or territory by population. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the median weekly income for people in the territory aged over 15 was $998 and higher than the national average of $662.<ref name=\"census\" /> The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is also higher than the national average. Within the ACT, 37.1% of the population hold a bachelor's degree level or above education compared to the national figure of 20%.<ref name=\"census\" />\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short

Australian Capital Territory}}\nThe environments range from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] area on the higher mountains, to [[sclerophyll]] forest and to [[woodland]]. Much of the ACT has been cleared for grazing and is also burnt off by [[bushfire]]s several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into [[vascular plants]], that include [[gymnosperm]]s, flowering plants, and [[fern]]s, as well as [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[fungi]] and freshwater [[algae]]. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the [[Australian flora|Flora of Australia]] and include well known plants such as [[Grevillea]], [[Eucalyptus]] trees and [[kangaroo grass]].\n\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT|last=McLeod|first=Ron|year=2003|isbn=0-642-60216-6|location=Canberra, ACT|ref=harv|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe fauna of the territory includes representatives from most major [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animal groups]]. This includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, platypus, echidna, emu, kookaburras and dragon lizards.\n\n===Geology===\n{{main|Geology of the Australian Capital Territory}}\nNotable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.\n\nIn the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022162853/http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2005|publisher=ACT Heritage Council|title=Entry to the ACT Heritage Register \u2013 20010.

During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name":

The kinds of plants can be grouped into [[vascular plants]], that include [[gymnosperm]]s, flowering plants, and [[fern]]s, as well as [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[fungi]] and freshwater [[algae]]. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the [[Australian flora|Flora of Australia]] and include well known plants such as [[Grevillea]], [[Eucalyptus]] trees and [[kangaroo grass]].\n\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT|last=McLeod|first=Ron|year=2003|isbn=0-642-60216-6|location=Canberra, ACT|ref=harv|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe fauna of the territory includes representatives from most major [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animal groups]].
