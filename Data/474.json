For a time he led [[Hut 8]], the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German [[cipher]]s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bombe]] method, an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]].\n\nTuring played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and in so doing helped win the war.<ref name=\"bbc-copeland\"/><ref>A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany.

In 1948, Turing joined [[Max Newman]]'s [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], where he helped develop the [[Manchester computers]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=231\u2013233}}</ref> and became interested in [[mathematical biology]]. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of [[morphogenesis]]<ref name=googlescholar/> and predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s such as the [[Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction]], first observed in the 1960s.\n\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the [[Labouchere Amendment]] of 1885 had mandated that \"gross indecency\" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted [[chemical castration]] treatment, with [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]], as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from [[cyanide poisoning]]. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.\n\nIn 2009, following an [[Internet campaign]], British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] made an [[#Government apology and pardon support|official public apology]] on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated\". [[Queen Elizabeth II]] granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013.

The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]].

He was interested in [[morphogenesis]], the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a [[reaction-diffusion system]], could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".<ref>{{cite news| first=Alan M. | last=Turing | authorlink=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | date=14 August 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | volume=237 | number=641 | pages=37\u201372 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}</ref> He used systems of [[partial differential equations]] to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]] had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''.<ref>John Gribbin, ''Deep Simplicity'', p. 126, Random House, 2004</ref>\n\nAlthough published before the structure and role of [[DNA]] was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.<ref>{{cite

Building on the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments.

For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]] had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to [[electroplating|electroplate]] gold onto spoons. The [[potassium cyanide]] was used to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]]. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.<ref name = \"Copeland\">{{cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate = 23 June 2012 | quote = We have&nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to [[electroplating|electroplate]] gold onto spoons. The [[potassium cyanide]] was used to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]]. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison.

to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201212/ldhansrd/text/120202w0001.htm

A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [[Alan Turing Memorial|statue of Turing]] was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in [[Sackville Park]], between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]]. The memorial statue depicts the \"father of computer science\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912\u20131954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an [[Enigma machine]]: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'. However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the 'u' in 'computer' matches up with the 'u' in 'ADXUO'. As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://benosteen.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/what-does-the-code-on-the-alan-turing-memorial-actually-say/|title=What does the code on the Alan Turing Memorial actually say?|date=2010-09-23|work=Random Hacks|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628125202/https://benosteen.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/what-does-the-code-on-the-alan-turing-memorial-actually-say/|archive-date=28 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Sackville Park Turing plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Turing memorial statue plaque in [[Sackville Park]], Manchester]]\nA plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'.

In 1994, a stretch of the [[A6010 road]] (the [[Manchester]] city intermediate ring road) was named \"Alan Turing Way\". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [[Alan Turing Memorial|statue of Turing]] was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in [[Sackville Park]], between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]]. The memorial statue depicts the \"father of computer science\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912\u20131954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an [[Enigma machine]]: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'. However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the 'u' in 'computer' matches up with the 'u' in 'ADXUO'. As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://benosteen.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/what-does-the-code-on-the-alan-turing-memorial-actually-say/|title=What does the code on the Alan Turing Memorial actually say?|date=2010-09-23|work=Random Hacks|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628125202/https://benosteen.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/what-does-the-code-on-the-alan-turing-memorial-actually-say/|archive-date=28 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Sackville Park Turing plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Turing memorial statue plaque in [[Sackville Park]], Manchester]]\nA plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'.

It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]], as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older brother John F.
