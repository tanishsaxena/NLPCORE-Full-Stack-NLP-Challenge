Each set contains at least one, and possibly infinitely many, elements. The axiom of choice allows us to arbitrarily select a single element from each set, forming a corresponding family of elements (''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) also indexed over the real numbers, with ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> drawn from S<sub>''i''</sub>. In general, the collections may be indexed over any set <span style=\"font-family:serif;\">''I''</span>, not just '''R'''.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]] equivalent to the statement that ''a [[Cartesian product#Infinite Cartesian products|Cartesian product]] of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty''. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is [[Infinite set|infinite]]. Formally, it states that for every [[indexed family]] <math>(S_i)_{i \\in I}</math> of [[nonempty]] sets there exists an indexed family <math>(x_i)_{i \\in I}</math> of elements such that <math>x_i \\in S_i</math> for every <math>i \\in I</math>.  The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in order to formalize his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zermelo|1904}}.</ref>\n\nIn many cases, such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice; this is in particular the case if the number of sets is finite, or if a selection rule is available \u2013 some distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one element in each set. An illustrative example is sets picked from the natural numbers. From such sets, one may always select the smallest number, e.g. in <nowiki>{{4, 5, 6}, {10, 12}, {1, 400, 617, 8000}}</nowiki> the smallest elements are {4, 10, 1}. In this case, \"select the smallest number\" is a [[choice function]]. Even if infinitely many sets were collected from the natural numbers, it will always be possible to choose the smallest element from each set to produce a set. That is, the choice function provides the set of chosen elements. However, no choice function is known for the collection of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers (if there are [[Constructible universe|non-constructible reals]]). In that case, the axiom of choice must be invoked.\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] coined an analogy: for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection; this makes it possible to directly define a choice function. For an ''infinite'' collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), there is no obvious way to make a function that selects one sock from each pair, without invoking the axiom of choice.<ref>{{harvnb|Jech|1977|p=351}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians,<ref>Jech, 1977, p.&nbsp;348''ff''; Martin-L\u00f6f 2008, p.&nbsp;210. According to {{harvnb|Mendelson|1964|p=201}}:\n: The status of the Axiom of Choice has become less controversial in recent years. To most mathematicians it seems quite plausible and it has so many important applications in practically all branches of mathematics that not to accept it would seem to be a wilful hobbling of the practicing mathematician.</ref> and it is included in the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]], Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ([[ZFC]]). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as [[Tychonoff's theorem]], require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the [[axiom of determinacy]]. The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]], although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "About", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "the mathematical concept"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the band named after it"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Axiom of Choice (band)"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2013"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Zermelo"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1904"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Jech"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1977"}, {"name": "p", "value": "351"}]}, {"name": "harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Mendelson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1964"}, {"name": "p", "value": "201"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Statement", "paragraphs": "A [[choice function]] is a function ''f'', defined on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets, such that for every set ''A'' in ''X'', ''f''(''A'') is an element of ''A''.

The axiom of choice can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 4}, {"title": "Usage", "paragraphs": "Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly, although it had not yet been formally stated. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said \"let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''\" to define a function ''F''.  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until [[Zermelo]].\n\nNot every situation requires the axiom of choice. For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]] to prove \"for every natural number ''k'', every family of ''k'' nonempty sets has a choice function.\") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the [[axiom of countable choice]]. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (''X''<sub>''i''</sub> : ''i''\u2208\u03c9) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, but there is no stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no \"limiting\" choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5}, {"title": "Examples", "paragraphs": "The nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection ''X'' is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.\n\nThe difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  Next we might try specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (0,1) does not have a least element: if ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So this attempt also fails.\n\nAdditionally, consider for instance the unit circle ''S'', and the action on ''S'' by a group ''G'' consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples of&nbsp;''\u03c0''. Here ''G'' is countable while ''S'' is uncountable. Hence ''S'' breaks up into uncountably many orbits under&nbsp;''G''. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset ''X'' of ''S'' with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint from&nbsp;''X''. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since ''X'' is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on ''S'', finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See [[non-measurable set#Example|non-measurable set]] for more details.\n\nThe reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element under the natural ordering.  One might say, \"Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.\"  The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 6}, {"title": "Criticism and acceptance", "paragraphs": "A proof requiring the axiom of choice may establish the existence of an object without explicitly [[definable set|defining]] the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the axiom of choice implies that there is a [[well-ordering]] of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no well-ordering of the reals is definable. Similarly, although a subset of the real numbers that is not [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]] can be proved to exist using the axiom of choice, it is [[consistent]] that no such set is definable.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Fraenkel | first1 = Abraham A. | author1-link = Abraham Fraenkel\n | last2 = Bar-Hillel | first2 = Yehoshua | author2-link = Yehoshua Bar-Hillel\n | last3 = L\u00e9vy | first3 = Azriel | author3-link = Azriel L\u00e9vy\n | edition = 2nd\n | location = Amsterdam-London\n | mr = 0345816\n | pages = 69\u201370\n | publisher = North-Holland Publishing Co.\n | title = Foundations of set theory\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ah2bwOwc06MC&pg=PA69\n | year = 1973| isbn = 9780080887050 }}.</ref>\n\nThe axiom of choice proves the existence of these intangibles (objects that are proved to exist, but which cannot be explicitly constructed), which may conflict with some philosophical principles.<ref>{{citation|title=The Elements of Mathematical Logic|first=Paul C.|last=Rosenbloom|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2005|isbn=9780486446172|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=089eY-s33EsC&pg=PA147}}.</ref> Because there is no [[Canonical form|canonical]] well-ordering of all sets, a construction that relies on a well-ordering may not produce a canonical result, even if a canonical result is desired (as is often the case in [[category theory]]).

The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.\n\nIt is possible to prove many theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation; such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of ZF, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model. The restriction to ZF renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation unprovable. For example, the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox is neither provable nor disprovable from ZF alone: it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in ZF, but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition. Similarly, all the statements listed below which require choice or some weaker version thereof for their proof are unprovable in ZF, but since each is provable in ZF plus the axiom of choice, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true. Statements such as the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox can be rephrased as conditional statements, for example, \"If AC holds, then the decomposition in the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox exists.\" Such conditional statements are provable in ZF when the original statements are provable from ZF and the axiom of choice.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "citation\n ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Fraenkel"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Abraham A."}, {"name": "author1-link", "value": "Abraham Fraenkel"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Bar-Hillel"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Yehoshua"}, {"name": "author2-link", "value": "Yehoshua Bar-Hillel"}, {"name": "last3", "value": "L\u00e9vy"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Azriel"}, {"name": "author3-link", "value": "Azriel L\u00e9vy"}, {"name": "edition", "value": "2nd"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Amsterdam-London"}, {"name": "mr", "value": "0345816"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "69\u201370"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "North-Holland Publishing Co."}, {"name": "title", "value": "Foundations of set theory"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=ah2bwOwc06MC&pg=PA69"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1973"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780080887050"}]}, {"name": "citation", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Elements of Mathematical Logic"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Paul C."}, {"name": "last", "value": "Rosenbloom"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Courier Dover Publications"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2005"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780486446172"}, {"name": "page", "value": "147"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=089eY-s33EsC&pg=PA147"}]}, {"name": "citation\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Dawson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "J.

In 1963, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] employed the technique of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], developed for this purpose, to show that, assuming ZF is consistent, the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF. He did this by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF\u00acC (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF\u00acC is consistent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:pd104gy5838/SCM0405.pdf|title=The Independence of the Axiom of Choice|last=Cohen|first=Paul|date=2019|website=Stanford University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTogether these results establish that the axiom of choice is [[Independence (mathematical logic)|logically independent]] of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.\n\nOne argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved. Many theorems which are provable using choice are of an elegant general character: every [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a ring is contained in a [[maximal ideal]], every [[vector space]] has a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]], and every [[Product topology|product]] of [[compact space]]s is compact. Without the axiom of choice, these theorems may not hold for mathematical objects of large cardinality.\n\nThe proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]], are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC.<ref>This is because arithmetical statements are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] to the [[constructible universe]] ''L''. [[Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem]] gives a more general result.</ref> Statements in this class include the statement that [[P = NP]], the [[Riemann hypothesis]], and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.\n\nThe axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZFC. However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "List of statements independent of ZFC"}]}, {"name": "Cite journal", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "24"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "12"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "556\u2013557"}, {"name": "last", "value": "G\u00f6del"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Kurt"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 9, 1938"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "1077160"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "16577857"}, {"name": "bibcode", "value": "1938PNAS...24..556G"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1073/pnas.24.12.556"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:pd104gy5838/SCM0405.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Independence of the Axiom of Choice"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Cohen"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Paul"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2019"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Stanford University Libraries"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2019-03-22"}]}], "id": 9}, {"title": "Stronger axioms", "paragraphs": "The [[axiom of constructibility]] and the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] each imply the axiom of choice and so are strictly stronger than it.
