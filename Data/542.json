In contrast, [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] hydrocarbons lack this delocalization. The term \"aromatic\" was assigned before the physical mechanism determining [[aromaticity]] was discovered; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, [[benzene]]. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ''monocyclic'' (MAH) or ''polycyclic'' (PAH).\n\nSome non-benzene-based compounds called '''heteroarenes''', which follow [[H\u00fcckel's rule]] (for monocyclic rings: when the number of its \u03c0 electrons equals 4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, where ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 1, 2, 3, ...), are also called aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the [[heteroatom]]s [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[sulfur]]. Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are [[furan]], a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and [[pyridine]], a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-aromatic.html HighBeam Encyclopedia: aromatic compound].</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hydrocarbon with alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings"}]}, {"name": "Redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Arene"}]}, {"name": "GoldBookRef ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "arenes"}, {"name": "file", "value": "A00435"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": " Benzene ring model ", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Benzene circle.svg|100px|right|thumb| [[Benzene]] ]]\n{{main|aromaticity}}\n[[Benzene]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one named as such. The nature of its bonding was first recognized by [[August Kekul\u00e9]] in the 19th century. Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one to each of the two neighbouring carbons. This leaves one electron to share with one of the two neighbouring carbon atoms, thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.\n\nThe structure is alternatively illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This depiction represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon\u2013carbon bonds all of [[bond order]] 1.5; the equivalency is explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.\n\nGeneral properties of aromatic hydrocarbons:\n\n# They display [[aromaticity]]\n# The carbon\u2013hydrogen ratio is high\n# They burn with a strong sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon\u2013hydrogen ratio\n# They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]s\n\nThe circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] and his student James Armit in 1925<ref>{{cite journal|first1=James Wilkins |last1=Armit |first2=Robert |last2=Robinson|author2-link=Robert Robinson (organic chemist) |date=1925 |title=Polynuclear heterocyclic aromatic types.

The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic \u03c0 system in some publications, or only those \u03c0 systems that obey [[H\u00fcckel's rule]] in others.
