M. Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (although this was severely criticised by [[Raymond Chandler]] for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, \"said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words\" (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.\n\nAnother reason Milne stopped writing children's books, and especially about Winnie-the-Pooh, was that he felt \"amazement and disgust\" over the fame his son was exposed to, and said that \"I feel that the legal Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him.
