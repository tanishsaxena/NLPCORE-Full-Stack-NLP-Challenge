Gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] movement, to the advent of [[Anti-imperialism|anticolonialism]] between the two World Wars.

Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and [[puritan]]ical constraints, and centers on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is shaped by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his 1936 voyage to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2013"}]}, {"name": "Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Andr\u00e9 Gide"}, {"name": "awards", "value": "{{awd|[[Nobel Prize in Literature]]|1947}}"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Andr\u00e9 Gide.jpg"}, {"name": "birth_name", "value": "Andr\u00e9 Paul Guillaume Gide"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date|df=yes|1869|11|22}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Paris]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|df=yes|1951|2|19|1869|11|22}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "Paris, [[French Fourth Republic|France]]"}, {"name": "resting_place", "value": "Cimeti\u00e8re de Cuverville, [[Cuverville, Seine-Maritime]]"}, {"name": "occupation", "value": "Novelist, essayist, dramatist"}, {"name": "notableworks", "value": "''[[The Immoralist|L'immoraliste]]'' (''The Immoralist'')<br /> ''[[Strait Is the Gate|La porte \u00e9troite]]'' (''Strait Is the Gate'')<br />  ''Les caves du Vatican'' (''The Vatican Cellars''; sometimes published in English under the title ''Lafcadio's Adventures'')<br /> ''[[La Symphonie Pastorale]]'' (''The Pastoral Symphony'')<br /> ''[[The Counterfeiters (novel)|Les faux-monnayeurs]]'' (''The Counterfeiters'')"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "Madeleine Rondeaux Gide"}, {"name": "children", "value": "Catherine Gide"}, {"name": "signature", "value": "Andr\u00e9 Gide signature.svg"}, {"name": "website", "value": "{{URL|andregide.org}}"}, {"name": "education", "value": "[[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]]"}]}, {"name": "awd", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "[[Nobel Prize in Literature]]"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1947"}]}, {"name": "birth date", "values": [{"name": "df", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1869"}, {"name": "2", "value": "11"}, {"name": "3", "value": "22"}]}, {"name": "death date and age", "values": [{"name": "df", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1951"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "19"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1869"}, {"name": "5", "value": "11"}, {"name": "6", "value": "22"}]}, {"name": "URL", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "andregide.org"}]}, {"name": "IPA-fr", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u0251\u0303d\u0281e p\u0254l \u0261ijom \u0292id"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lang"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.andregide.org/remembrance/nytgide.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "new york time obituary"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.andregide.org"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "20 March 2018"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110806050538/http://www.andregide.org/remembrance/nytgide.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "6 August 2011"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "df", "value": "dmy-all"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Early life", "paragraphs": "[[File:Gide 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gide in 1893]]\nGide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class [[Protestant]] family.

Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence \u2013 \"the best part of myself,\" he later commented. In 1918, he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.\n\nIn the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.\n\nIn 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]]. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between All\u00e9gret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe.
