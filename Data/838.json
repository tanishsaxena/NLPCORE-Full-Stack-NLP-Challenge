Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] for the rest of his life. According to [[Damascius]], during the persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]] at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the [[Christianity|Christian]] authorities so that he could continue his lectures.<ref>Damascius, ''Philosophos Historia'', 118B, Athanassiadi</ref> Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote.

A commentary on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.\n\nIn ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent.
