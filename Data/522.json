These artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the Emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]].  Examples of these include talismans, charts, writs, tallies, and registers.  The first examples were stones, jade pieces, bronze vessels and weapons, but came to include talismans and magic diagrams.<ref name=\"SeidelAnna\">Seidel, Anna. \"Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments\", in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises. pp. 291-371.</ref> From their roots in [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era China (1066 to 256 B.C.) these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the [[Han dynasty]] (206 B.C. to A.D. 220). Most of these texts have been destroyed as Emperors, particularly during the Han dynasty, collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed, forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals.<ref name=\"SeidelAnna\" /> It is therefore fitting with the Greek root of the word, as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling Emperor from challenges to his status as Heaven's choice as sovereign.\n\n===Writings of questionable value===<!-- This was originally part of the Esoteric writing section, but it does not seem to fit.It seems to be a separate topic-->\n\"Apocrypha\" was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church. Many in [[Protestant]] traditions cite Revelation 22:18\u201319 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra-biblical writings such as the Apocrypha. However, a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the [[Book of Revelation]]. Rv.22:18\u201319f. (KJV) states: \"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\"  In the context of Revelation, a book predicting the future atrocities of man, it means that God will strip them of the goodness of life (\"from the things written in this book\") and that they will be removed from heaven (\"out of the book of life\").   The early Christian theologian [[Origen]], in his ''Commentaries on Matthew'', distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings: {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd \u1f12\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4' \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f12\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} (''writing not found on the common and published books in one hand, actually found on the secret ones on the other'').<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1016.htm ''Commentaries on Matthew'', X. 18, XIII. 57]{{Nonspecific|date=March 2010}}</ref> The meaning of \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 is here practically equivalent to \"excluded from the public use of the church\", and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.<ref name=EB1911 />\n\n===Spurious writings===\nIn general use, the word \"apocrypha\" came to mean \"false, spurious, bad, or heretical.\" This meaning also appears in Origen's prologue to his commentary on the [[Song of Songs]], of which only the [[Latin]] translation survives: ''De scripturis his, quae appellantur apocriphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a maioribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.''<ref name=EB1911 /> \"Concerning these scriptures, which are called apocryphal, for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders, it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority.\"\n\n===Other===\nOther uses of ''apocrypha'' developed over the history of Western Christianity.  The [[Gelasian Decree]] (generally held now as being  the work of an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553) refers to religious works by [[church fathers]] [[Eusebius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] as apocrypha. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] defined the word as meaning simply \"obscurity of origin,\" implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered apocryphal. On the other hand, [[Jerome]] (in ''Protogus Galeatus'') declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal. In practice, Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical, and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, instead retaining the word's prior meaning (''see: [[Deuterocanon]]'').<ref name=EB1911 /> As a result, various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha, treating them with varying levels of regard.\n \n[[Origen]] (who stated that \"the canonical books, as the Hebrews have handed them down, are twenty-two\"),<ref>{{cite web|title=Origen on the Canon|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/origen.html|website=BibleResearcher.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] and others cited some apocryphal books as \"scripture,\" \"divine scripture,\" \"inspired,\" and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and familiar with the [[protocanonical books|Hebrew canon]] excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of [[Melito of Sardis]], and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the [[Hebrew]] collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from [[paganism]], and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as \"[[ecclesiastical]]\" works by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]].<ref name=EB1911 />\n\nThese three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s alike. In 1546 the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring \"He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin [[Vulgate]], as sacred and canonical.\" The whole of the books in question, with the exception of [[1 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], were declared canonical at Trent.<ref name=EB1911 /> The Protestants, in comparison,  were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on. Some considered them divinely inspired, others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible, but no doctrine should be based on them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[John Wycliffe]], a 14th-century Christian Humanist, had declared in his biblical translation that \"whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief.\"<ref name=EB1911 /> Nevertheless, his translation of the Bible included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] and the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans|Epistle of the Laodiceans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/wycliffe/|title=John Wycliffe's Translation|work=nnu.edu}}</ref>\n\nMartin Luther did not class apocryphal books as being Scripture, but in both the [[Luther Bible|German]] (1534) translation of the Bible, the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books, although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster), readers were warned that these books were not \"to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.\" A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere, such as in the \"argument\" introducing them in the [[Geneva Bible]], and in the Sixth Article of the [[Church of England]], where it is said that \"the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,\" though not to establish doctrine.<ref name=EB1911 />  Among some other Protestants,  the term ''apocryphal'' began to take on extra or altered connotations: not just of dubious authenticity, but having spurious or false content,<ref name=\"McDonald\" /> not just obscure but having hidden or suspect motives.{{citation needed|reason=needs published reference|date=November 2015}}  Protestants were (and are) not unanimous in adopting those meanings. The [[Church of England]] agreed, and that view continues today throughout the [[Lutheran Church]], the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], and many other denominations.{{citation needed|reason=needs reliable source|date=November 2015}}  Whichever implied meaning is intended, ''Apocrypha'' was (and is) used primarily by Protestants, in reference to the books of questioned canonicity. [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] sometimes avoid using the term in contexts where it might be disputatious or be misconstrued as yielding on the point of canonicity.  Thus the respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations. Most Protestant published Bibles that include the apocryphal books will relocate them into a separate section (rather like an appendix), so as not to intermingle them with their canonical books.\n\nAccording to the [[Orthodox Anglican Church]]:\n\n{{quote|On the other hand, the Anglican Communion emphatically maintains that the Apocrypha is part of the Bible and is to be read with respect by her members. Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the Benedictus es and Benedicite, are taken from the Apocrypha.

However, a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the [[Book of Revelation]]. Rv.22:18\u201319f.

The [[Gelasian Decree]] (generally held now as being  the work of an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553) refers to religious works by [[church fathers]] [[Eusebius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] as apocrypha. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] defined the word as meaning simply \"obscurity of origin,\" implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered apocryphal. On the other hand, [[Jerome]] (in ''Protogus Galeatus'') declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal. In practice, Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical, and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, instead retaining the word's prior meaning (''see: [[Deuterocanon]]'').<ref name=EB1911 /> As a result, various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha, treating them with varying levels of regard.\n \n[[Origen]] (who stated that \"the canonical books, as the Hebrews have handed them down, are twenty-two\"),<ref>{{cite web|title=Origen on the Canon|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/origen.html|website=BibleResearcher.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] and others cited some apocryphal books as \"scripture,\" \"divine scripture,\" \"inspired,\" and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and familiar with the [[protocanonical books|Hebrew canon]] excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of [[Melito of Sardis]], and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the [[Hebrew]] collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from [[paganism]], and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as \"[[ecclesiastical]]\" works by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]].<ref name=EB1911 />\n\nThese three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s alike. In 1546 the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring \"He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin [[Vulgate]], as sacred and canonical.\" The whole of the books in question, with the exception of [[1 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], were declared canonical at Trent.<ref name=EB1911 /> The Protestants, in comparison,  were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on. Some considered them divinely inspired, others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible, but no doctrine should be based on them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[John Wycliffe]], a 14th-century Christian Humanist, had declared in his biblical translation that \"whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief.\"<ref name=EB1911 /> Nevertheless, his translation of the Bible included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] and the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans|Epistle of the Laodiceans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/wycliffe/|title=John Wycliffe's Translation|work=nnu.edu}}</ref>\n\nMartin Luther did not class apocryphal books as being Scripture, but in both the [[Luther Bible|German]] (1534) translation of the Bible, the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books, although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster), readers were warned that these books were not \"to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.\" A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere, such as in the \"argument\" introducing them in the [[Geneva Bible]], and in the Sixth Article of the [[Church of England]], where it is said that \"the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,\" though not to establish doctrine.<ref name=EB1911 />  Among some other Protestants,  the term ''apocryphal'' began to take on extra or altered connotations: not just of dubious authenticity, but having spurious or false content,<ref name=\"McDonald\" /> not just obscure but having hidden or suspect motives.{{citation needed|reason=needs published reference|date=November 2015}}  Protestants were (and are) not unanimous in adopting those meanings. The [[Church of England]] agreed, and that view continues today throughout the [[Lutheran Church]], the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], and many other denominations.{{citation needed|reason=needs reliable source|date=November 2015}}  Whichever implied meaning is intended, ''Apocrypha'' was (and is) used primarily by Protestants, in reference to the books of questioned canonicity. [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] sometimes avoid using the term in contexts where it might be disputatious or be misconstrued as yielding on the point of canonicity.  Thus the respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations.

In the sixteenth century, during the Protestant reformation, some authorities began using term ''deuterocanonical'' to refer to this traditional intertestamental collection as books of \"the second canon.\" <ref>The ''Style Manual for the Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical literature'' instead of ''apocrypha'' in academic writing, although not all apocryphal books are properly deuterocanonical.</ref> These books are often seen as \"intertestamental\" because reading them helps explain the theological and cultural transitions which took place between the Old and New Testaments. They are also sometimes called \"intertestamental\" by religious groups who do not recognize Hellenistic Judaism as belonging with either \"Jewish\" or \"Christian\" testaments.\n\nSlightly varying collections of apocryphal, deuterocanonical, or intertestamental books of the Bible form part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] canons (cf [[Development of the Old Testament canon]]). The deuterocanonical or intertestamental books of the Catholic Church include 1-2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, the Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, the Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, the Prayer of Manasseh, and 1-2 Maccabees.\n\nThe [[Book of Enoch]] is included in the biblical canon of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea.  The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes the book of Enoch, and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and [[1 Peter]].<ref>Clontz, T.E. and J., \"The Comprehensive New Testament\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accordancebible.com/Comprehensive-Crossreferences|title=New Release: Comprehensive Bible Cross References|first=Accordance Bible|last=Software|date=|website=Accordance Bible Software|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref> The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]]<ref name=EB1911 /> and much of the early church. The epistles of Paul and the gospels also show influences from the [[Book of Jubilees]], which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the [[Assumption of Moses]] and the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]], which are included in no biblical canon.\n\nThe canonical validity of the intertestamental books was challenged in the 16th century by Protestants. The Protestant removal of the deuterocanonical books of the Bible did not happen immediately as part of the Reformation, but rather happened in waves over time. The apocryphal books were in fact translated as part of the King James Version of the Bible. Eventually they were effectively removed by Protestants during the 1800s, with some Protestants arguing against their inclusion for theological reasons, and with other Protestants citing the cost of publishing the hidden books as a major factor in removing them. Today it is possible to find Protestant Bibles which now include the Apocrypha. The status of the deuterocanonicals remains unchanged in Catholic and Orthodox Christianities.\n\n===Christianity===\n\n====Disputes over canonicity====\nThe actual status of the books which the Catholic church terms ''Deuterocanonicals'' (second canon) and Protestantism refers to as ''Apocrypha'' has been an issue of disagreement which preceded the Reformation. Many believe that the pre-Christian-era Jewish translation (into Greek) of holy scriptures known as the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures originally compiled around 280 B.C., originally included the apocryphal writings in dispute, with little distinction made between them and the rest of the [[Old Testament]].  Others argue that the Septuagint of the first century did not contain these books but were added later by Christians,<ref name=\"Wegner\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beckwith |first1=Roger T.|title=The Canon of the Old Testament|date=November 1, 2008|publisher=Wipf & Stock Pub|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=978-1606082492|pages=62, 382\u201383|url=http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ejt/apocrypha_blocher.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>  The earliest extant manuscripts of the Septuagint are from the fourth century, and suffer greatly from a lack of uniformity as regards containing apocryphal books,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=E.

In response to this challenge, after the death of Martin Luther (February 8, 1546)  the ecumenical [[Council of Trent]] officially (\"infallibly\") declared these books (called \"deuterocanonical\" by Catholics) to be part of the canon in  April, 1546 A.D.

Protestants also rejected the Catholic term \"deuterocanonical\" for these writings, preferring to apply the term \"apocryphal\" which was already in use for other early and disputed writings. As today (but along with others reasons),<ref name=\"Wegner\"/>  various reformers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason. The differences between canons can be seen under [[Biblical canon#Old Testament|Biblical canon]] and [[Development of the Christian biblical canon]].  \n \nExplaining the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the [[Roman Catholic]] church in the interpretation of how it was done.  Those differences (in matters of jurisdictional authority) were contributing factors in the [[East-West Schism|separation of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox]] around 1054, but the formation of the canon which Trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century, in not settled, six centuries before the separation.  In the eastern part of the church, it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement, but in the end it was accomplished.  The canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alike.  The East did already differ from the West in not considering every question of canon yet settled, and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its Old Testament.  It also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided, which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions, but not all.  Thus, there are today a few remaining differences of canon among Orthodox, and all Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon. The [[Psalms of Solomon]],  [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]]  the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], the  [[Prayer of Manasseh]] and [[Psalm 151]] are included in some copies of the Septuagint,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Testament Canon and Apocrypha|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon2.html|website=BibleResearcher|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches.   Protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either, but see them having roughly the same status as the other Apocrypha.\n\n====New Testament apocrypha====\n{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}\nNew Testament apocrypha\u2014books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants\u2014include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]). Others of these were produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars,{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the [[pseudepigraphical]] [[Infancy Gospel of James]].\n\nBefore the fifth century, the Christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient [[antilegomena]]e.  These were all candidates for the New Testament and included several books which were eventually accepted, such as: [[The Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[2 Peter]], [[3 John]] and the [[Revelation of John]] (Apocalypse).  None of those accepted books can be considered Apocryphal now, since all Christendom accepts them as canonical.  Of the uncanonized ones, the Early Church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well.  Some Christians, in an extension of the meaning, might also consider the non-heretical books to be \"apocryphal\" along the manner of Martin Luther: not canon, but useful to read.  This category includes books such as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Didache]], and [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] which are sometimes referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]].\nThe [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels.<ref name=EB1911 /> While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.\n\nRoman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] have in the past also included [[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|I & II Clement]] and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] in their [[New Testament]] canon.\n\n====List of Sixty====\nThe List of Sixty, dating to around the 7th century, lists the sixty books of the Bible. The unknown author also lists several apocryphal books that are not included amongst the sixty.

Emerging from the instability of the [[Warring States period]] (476\u2013221 BCE), ancient Chinese scholars saw the centralized rule of the Zhou as an ideal model for the new Han empire to emulate. The ''Ch'an-wei'' are therefore texts written by Han scholars about the Zhou royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign. These texts took the form of stories about texts and objects being conferred upon the Emperors by Heaven and comprising these ancient sage-king's (this is how the Zhou emperors were referred to by this time, about 500 years after their peak) royal regalia.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The desired effect was to confirm the Han emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]] through the continuity offered by his possession of these same sacred talismans. It is because of this politicized recording of their history that it is difficult to retrace the exact origins of these objects. What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the ''[[fangshi]]''. These were a class of nobles who were not part of the state administration; they were considered specialists or occultists, for example diviners, astrologers, alchemists or healers.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It is from this class of nobles that the first [[Taoist]] priests are believed to have emerged.

Catholic Christians incorporated several of these books into the canon of the Christian Bible, calling them the \"apocrypha\" or the \"hidden books\" of the Bible. Patristic authorities frequently recognized these books as important to the emergence of apostolic Christianity, but the inspired authority and value of the apocrypha remained widely disputed. In the sixteenth century, during the Protestant reformation, some authorities began using term ''deuterocanonical'' to refer to this traditional intertestamental collection as books of \"the second canon.\" <ref>The ''Style Manual for the Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical literature'' instead of ''apocrypha'' in academic writing, although not all apocryphal books are properly deuterocanonical.</ref> These books are often seen as \"intertestamental\" because reading them helps explain the theological and cultural transitions which took place between the Old and New Testaments. They are also sometimes called \"intertestamental\" by religious groups who do not recognize Hellenistic Judaism as belonging with either \"Jewish\" or \"Christian\" testaments.\n\nSlightly varying collections of apocryphal, deuterocanonical, or intertestamental books of the Bible form part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] canons (cf [[Development of the Old Testament canon]]). The deuterocanonical or intertestamental books of the Catholic Church include 1-2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, the Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, the Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, the Prayer of Manasseh, and 1-2 Maccabees.\n\nThe [[Book of Enoch]] is included in the biblical canon of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea.  The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes the book of Enoch, and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and [[1 Peter]].<ref>Clontz, T.E. and J., \"The Comprehensive New Testament\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accordancebible.com/Comprehensive-Crossreferences|title=New Release: Comprehensive Bible Cross References|first=Accordance Bible|last=Software|date=|website=Accordance Bible Software|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref> The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]]<ref name=EB1911 /> and much of the early church. The epistles of Paul and the gospels also show influences from the [[Book of Jubilees]], which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the [[Assumption of Moses]] and the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]], which are included in no biblical canon.\n\nThe canonical validity of the intertestamental books was challenged in the 16th century by Protestants. The Protestant removal of the deuterocanonical books of the Bible did not happen immediately as part of the Reformation, but rather happened in waves over time. The apocryphal books were in fact translated as part of the King James Version of the Bible. Eventually they were effectively removed by Protestants during the 1800s, with some Protestants arguing against their inclusion for theological reasons, and with other Protestants citing the cost of publishing the hidden books as a major factor in removing them. Today it is possible to find Protestant Bibles which now include the Apocrypha. The status of the deuterocanonicals remains unchanged in Catholic and Orthodox Christianities.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Biblical apocrypha"}]}, {"name": "see also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Intertestamental period"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-0-9778737-1-5"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.accordancebible.com/Comprehensive-Crossreferences"}, {"name": "title", "value": "New Release: Comprehensive Bible Cross References"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Accordance Bible"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Software"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Accordance Bible Software"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "21 April 2018"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "Christianity", "paragraphs": "\n====Disputes over canonicity====\nThe actual status of the books which the Catholic church terms ''Deuterocanonicals'' (second canon) and Protestantism refers to as ''Apocrypha'' has been an issue of disagreement which preceded the Reformation.

In response to this challenge, after the death of Martin Luther (February 8, 1546)  the ecumenical [[Council of Trent]] officially (\"infallibly\") declared these books (called \"deuterocanonical\" by Catholics) to be part of the canon in  April, 1546 A.D. While the Protestant Reformers rejected the parts of the canon that were not part of the [[Hebrew Bible]], they included the four New Testament books Luther held as  doubtful  canonicity along with the Apocrypha in his non-binding canon (though most were separately included in his bible,<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Lee Martin|title=Forgotten Scriptures: The Selection and Rejection of Early Religious Writings|date=2009|location=Louisville, KY 40202-1396|isbn=978-0664233570|pages=11\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n9U4T2aYQJ8C&pg=PR4&lpg=PR4&dq=Forgotten+Scriptures:+The+Selection+and+Rejection+of+Early+Religious+Writings+By+Lee+Martin+McDonald|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>  as  they were in some editions of the KJV bible until 1947).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hiers|first1=Richard H.|title=The Trinity Guide to the Bible|date=October 1, 2001|publisher=Trinity Press International|location=Norcross, GA 3007|isbn=1563383403|page=148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eKhBPOKzHkUC&pg=PA148&dq=luther+include+the+apocrypha+in+his+bible#v=onepage&q=luther%20include%20the%20apocrypha%20in%20his%20bible&f=false|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>  Protestantism therefore established a 66 book canon with the 39 books based on the ancient Hebrew canon, along with the traditional 27 books of the New Testament. Protestants also rejected the Catholic term \"deuterocanonical\" for these writings, preferring to apply the term \"apocryphal\" which was already in use for other early and disputed writings. As today (but along with others reasons),<ref name=\"Wegner\"/>  various reformers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason. The differences between canons can be seen under [[Biblical canon#Old Testament|Biblical canon]] and [[Development of the Christian biblical canon]].  \n \nExplaining the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the [[Roman Catholic]] church in the interpretation of how it was done.  Those differences (in matters of jurisdictional authority) were contributing factors in the [[East-West Schism|separation of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox]] around 1054, but the formation of the canon which Trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century, in not settled, six centuries before the separation.  In the eastern part of the church, it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement, but in the end it was accomplished.  The canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alike.  The East did already differ from the West in not considering every question of canon yet settled, and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its Old Testament.  It also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided, which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions, but not all.  Thus, there are today a few remaining differences of canon among Orthodox, and all Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon. The [[Psalms of Solomon]],  [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]]  the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], the  [[Prayer of Manasseh]] and [[Psalm 151]] are included in some copies of the Septuagint,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Testament Canon and Apocrypha|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon2.html|website=BibleResearcher|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches.   Protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either, but see them having roughly the same status as the other Apocrypha.\n\n====New Testament apocrypha====\n{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}\nNew Testament apocrypha\u2014books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants\u2014include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]). Others of these were produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars,{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the [[pseudepigraphical]] [[Infancy Gospel of James]].\n\nBefore the fifth century, the Christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient [[antilegomena]]e.  These were all candidates for the New Testament and included several books which were eventually accepted, such as: [[The Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[2 Peter]], [[3 John]] and the [[Revelation of John]] (Apocalypse).  None of those accepted books can be considered Apocryphal now, since all Christendom accepts them as canonical.  Of the uncanonized ones, the Early Church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well.  Some Christians, in an extension of the meaning, might also consider the non-heretical books to be \"apocryphal\" along the manner of Martin Luther: not canon, but useful to read.  This category includes books such as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Didache]], and [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] which are sometimes referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]].\nThe [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels.<ref name=EB1911 /> While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.\n\nRoman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] have in the past also included [[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|I & II Clement]] and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] in their [[New Testament]] canon.\n\n====List of Sixty====\nThe List of Sixty, dating to around the 7th century, lists the sixty books of the Bible.

In response to this challenge, after the death of Martin Luther (February 8, 1546)  the ecumenical [[Council of Trent]] officially (\"infallibly\") declared these books (called \"deuterocanonical\" by Catholics) to be part of the canon in  April, 1546 A.D. While the Protestant Reformers rejected the parts of the canon that were not part of the [[Hebrew Bible]], they included the four New Testament books Luther held as  doubtful  canonicity along with the Apocrypha in his non-binding canon (though most were separately included in his bible,<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Lee Martin|title=Forgotten Scriptures: The Selection and Rejection of Early Religious Writings|date=2009|location=Louisville, KY 40202-1396|isbn=978-0664233570|pages=11\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n9U4T2aYQJ8C&pg=PR4&lpg=PR4&dq=Forgotten+Scriptures:+The+Selection+and+Rejection+of+Early+Religious+Writings+By+Lee+Martin+McDonald|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref>  as  they were in some editions of the KJV bible until 1947).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hiers|first1=Richard H.|title=The Trinity Guide to the Bible|date=October 1, 2001|publisher=Trinity Press International|location=Norcross, GA 3007|isbn=1563383403|page=148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eKhBPOKzHkUC&pg=PA148&dq=luther+include+the+apocrypha+in+his+bible#v=onepage&q=luther%20include%20the%20apocrypha%20in%20his%20bible&f=false|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>  Protestantism therefore established a 66 book canon with the 39 books based on the ancient Hebrew canon, along with the traditional 27 books of the New Testament. Protestants also rejected the Catholic term \"deuterocanonical\" for these writings, preferring to apply the term \"apocryphal\" which was already in use for other early and disputed writings. As today (but along with others reasons),<ref name=\"Wegner\"/>  various reformers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason. The differences between canons can be seen under [[Biblical canon#Old Testament|Biblical canon]] and [[Development of the Christian biblical canon]].  \n \nExplaining the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the [[Roman Catholic]] church in the interpretation of how it was done.  Those differences (in matters of jurisdictional authority) were contributing factors in the [[East-West Schism|separation of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox]] around 1054, but the formation of the canon which Trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century, in not settled, six centuries before the separation.  In the eastern part of the church, it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement, but in the end it was accomplished.  The canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alike.  The East did already differ from the West in not considering every question of canon yet settled, and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its Old Testament.  It also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided, which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions, but not all.  Thus, there are today a few remaining differences of canon among Orthodox, and all Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon. The [[Psalms of Solomon]],  [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]]  the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], the  [[Prayer of Manasseh]] and [[Psalm 151]] are included in some copies of the Septuagint,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Testament Canon and Apocrypha|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon2.html|website=BibleResearcher|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches.   Protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either, but see them having roughly the same status as the other Apocrypha.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Beckwith"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Roger T."}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Canon of the Old Testament"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 1, 2008"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Wipf & Stock Pub"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Eugene, OR"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-1606082492"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "62, 382\u201383"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ejt/apocrypha_blocher.pdf"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "23 November 2015"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Ellis"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "E.

Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]). Others of these were produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars,{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the [[pseudepigraphical]] [[Infancy Gospel of James]].\n\nBefore the fifth century, the Christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient [[antilegomena]]e.  These were all candidates for the New Testament and included several books which were eventually accepted, such as: [[The Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[2 Peter]], [[3 John]] and the [[Revelation of John]] (Apocalypse).  None of those accepted books can be considered Apocryphal now, since all Christendom accepts them as canonical.  Of the uncanonized ones, the Early Church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well.  Some Christians, in an extension of the meaning, might also consider the non-heretical books to be \"apocryphal\" along the manner of Martin Luther: not canon, but useful to read.  This category includes books such as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Didache]], and [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] which are sometimes referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]].\nThe [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels.<ref name=EB1911 /> While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.\n\nRoman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]].

The ''Ch'an-wei'' are therefore texts written by Han scholars about the Zhou royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign.

What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the ''[[fangshi]]''.
