The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned [[Ahithophel]] (sometimes spelled Achitophel).\n\nDavid took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the [[Jordan River]]. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle.\n\n===The Battle of Ephraim's Wood===\n[[File:Muerte de absalon en el CESEDEN.jpg|thumb|18th-century tapestry of the death of Absalom.]]\nA fateful [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim|battle]] was fought in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:18}}</ref> Absalom's head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it.

And again, elsewhere: \"By his vile stratagem he deceived and stole three hearts, that of his father, of the elders, and finally of the whole nation of Israel, and for this reason three darts were thrust into his heart to end his treacherous life\" (Tosef., So\u1e6dah, iii. 17). More striking is the following: \"Did one ever hear of an oak-tree having a heart? And yet in the oak-tree in whose branches Absalom was caught, we read that upon its heart he was held up still alive while the darts were thrust through him [Mek., Shirah, \u00a7 6]. This is to show that when a man becomes so heartless as to make war against his own father, nature itself takes on a heart to avenge the deed.\"\n\nPopular legend states that the eye of Absalom was of immense size, signifying his insatiable greed (Niddah, 24b). Indeed, \"hell itself opened beneath him, and David, his father, cried seven times: 'My son! my son!' while bewailing his death, praying at the same time for his redemption from the seventh section of Gehenna, to which he was consigned\" (So\u1e6dah, 10b). According to R. Meir (Sanh. 103b), \"he has no share in the life to come\". And according to the description of Gehenna by Joshua ben Levi, who, like Dante, wandered through hell under the guidance of the angel Duma, Absalom still dwells there, having the rebellious heathen in charge; and when the angels with their fiery rods run also against Absalom to smite him like the rest, a heavenly voice says: \"Spare Absalom, the son of David, My servant.\"<ref>\"[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/637-absalom Absalom]\".

While closely following the main events as related in the Bible, Havas concentrates on the motives behind Absalom\u2019s actions, which are more complex than depicted in the scriptures.\n\n===Music===\n* [[Josquin des Prez]] composed the [[motet]] \"Absalon, fili mi\" on the occasion of the death of [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Juan Borgia]] (Absalon being a further alternative spelling).\n* [[Nicolas Gombert|Nicholas Gombert]] composed the two-part, eight-voice motet \"Lugebat David Absalon\".\n* [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] (1585\u20131672) composed \"Fili mi, Absalon\" as part of his Sinfoniae Sacrae, op. 6.\n* The single verse, 2 Samuel 18:33, regarding David's grief at the loss of his son (\"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\"), is the inspiration for the text of several pieces of choral music, usually entitled ''When David Heard'' (such as those by Renaissance composers [[Thomas Tomkins]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]], or modern composers [[Eric Whitacre]], Joshua Shank, and Norman Dinerstein). This verse is also used in \"David's Lamentation\" by [[William Billings]], first published in 1778.\n* [[Leonard Cohen]]'s poem \"Prayer for Sunset\" compares the setting sun to the raving Absalom, and asks whether another Joab will arrive tomorrow night to kill Absalom again.\n* \"Absalom, Absalom\" is a song on the 1996 Compass CD ''Making Light of It'' by singer/songwriter [[Pierce Pettis]], incorporating several elements of the biblical narrative.\n* The Australian composer [[Nigel Butterley]] set the verse in his 2008 choral work \"Beni Avshalom\", commissioned by the [[Sydney Chamber Choir]].\n* During the finale of the song \"[[Distant Early Warning (song)|Distant Early Warning]]\" by Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Geddy Lee]] sings, \"Absalom, Absalom, Absalom\"; lyrics written by drummer [[Neil Peart]].\n* [[David Olney]]'s 2000 CD ''Omar's Blues'' includes the song \"Absalom\". The song depicts David grieving over the death of his son.\n* The story of Absalom is referred to several places in folk singer [[Adam Arcuragi]]'s song \"Always Almost Crying\".\n* The San Francisco-based band [[Om (band)|Om]] mentions Absalom in their song \"Kapila's Theme\" from their debut album ''[[Variations on a Theme (Om album)|Variations on a Theme]]''.\n* The garage folk band David's Doldrums references Absalom in their song, \"My Name Is Absalom\". The song alludes to Absalom's feelings of solemnity and abandonment of love and hope.\n* In \"Every Kind Word\" by [[Lackthereof]], Danny Seim's project parallel to [[Menomena]], Seim sings \"...&nbsp;and your hair is long like Absalom.\"\n* \"Barach Hamelech\", an Israeli song by Amos Etinger and Yosef Hadar.\n* The [[grindcore]] band [[Discordance Axis]] references Absalom at the end of the track entitled \"Castration Rite\".<!-- Don't seem to be notable, no article: * The [[progressive metal]] band from [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]], Absalom has his name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://karmametalcolombian.blogspot.com/2008/04/absalom-absalom-colombian-2003.html |title=Un Alma Oculto |author=Infernal North |date=8 April 2008 |publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref> -->\n* In 2007 [[Ryland Angel]] released \"Absalom\" on Ryland Angel-Manhattan Records.\n* \"Hanging By His Hair\" from the 1998 ''[[Wormwood: Curious Stories from the Bible|Wormwood]]'' album by [[The Residents]] recounts Absalom's defiance and death.
