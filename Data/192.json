This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          =

This trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by [[Hiroshi Tada]]; and Germany in 1965 by [[Katsuaki Asai]]. Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961. [[Seiichi Sugano]] was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.\n\n===Proliferation of independent organizations===\n{{further|Aikido styles}}\n{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikid\u014dka}}\n\nThe largest aikido organization is the [[Aikikai Foundation]], which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has developed into many styles, most of which were formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nThe earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,<ref name=\"Mochizuki\"/> [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Yoshinkan Aikido \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225749/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |archivedate=26 September 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> and [[Shodokan Aikido]], founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]] in 1967.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite book\n| last = Shishido\n| first = Fumiaki\n| authorlink = Fumiaki Shishida\n|last2=Nariyama\n|first2=Tetsuro\n|authorlink2= Tetsuro Nariyama\n| title = Aikido: Tradition and the Competitive Edge\n| publisher = Shodokan Publishing USA\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-0-9647083-2-7\n}}</ref> The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n",

Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "further", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Aikido styles"}]}, {"name": "see also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "List of aikidoka"}, {"name": "l1", "value": "List of aikid\u014dka"}]}, {"name": "cite encyclopedia\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Pranin"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Stanley"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Yoshinkan Aikido"}, {"name": "encyclopedia", "value": "Encyclopedia of Aikido"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225749/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "26 September 2007"}]}, {"name": "cite book\n", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Shishido"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Fumiaki"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Fumiaki Shishida"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Nariyama"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Tetsuro"}, {"name": "authorlink2", "value": "Tetsuro Nariyama"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Aikido: Tradition and the Competitive Edge"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Shodokan Publishing USA"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-9647083-2-7"}]}, {"name": "cite encyclopedia\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Pranin"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Stanley"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Tohei, Koichi"}, {"name": "encyclopedia", "value": "Encyclopedia of Aikido"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "7 August 2007"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "headquarters"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834"}, {"name": "3", "value": "honbu d\u014dj\u014d"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Ki", "paragraphs": "[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}.

''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ja"}, {"name": "2", "value": "[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ja"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u6c17"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ja"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u6c23"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"health\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u5143\u6c17"}, {"name": "3", "value": "genki"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"shyness\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u5185\u6c17"}, {"name": "3", "value": "uchiki"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Reed"}, {"name": "first", "value": "William"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "11 August 2007"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "19 June 2007"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Training", "paragraphs": "In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training.

''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration. Additionally, the target may also become unbalanced while attempting to avoid a strike (by jerking the head back, for example) which may allow for an easier throw.<ref name=\"dynamic\">{{cite book\n| last = Shioda\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n| title = Dynamic Aikido\n| publisher = Kodansha International\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/dynamicaikido00shio_0/page/52 52\u201355]\n| year = 1968\n| isbn = 978-0-87011-301-7\n| url = https://archive.org/details/dynamicaikido00shio_0/page/52\n}}</ref>\nMany sayings about ''atemi'' are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Scott\n |first       = Nathan\n |title       = Teachings of Ueshiba Morihei Sensei\n |year        = 2000\n |url         = http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html\n |accessdate  = 1 February 2007\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231203238/http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html\n |archivedate = 31 December 2006\n |url-status     = dead\n\n}}</ref>\n\n===Weapons===\n[[Image:PRehse002-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Disarming an attacker using a {{Nihongo|\"sword taking\"|\u592a\u5200\u53d6\u308a|tachi-dori}} technique.]]\n\nWeapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff (''[[j\u014d]]'') (these techniques closely resemble the use of the bayonet, or [[J\u016bkend\u014d]]), the wooden sword (''[[bokken]]''), and the knife (''[[tant\u014d]]'').<ref>{{cite book| last = Dang\n| first = Phong\n| title = Aikido Weapons Techniques: The Wooden Sword, Stick, and Knife of Aikido\n| publisher = Charles E Tuttle Company\n| year = 2006\n| isbn = 978-0-8048-3641-8\n}}</ref> Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques, where either weapon-taking and/or weapon-retention may be taught. Some schools, such as the [[Iwama style]] of [[Morihiro Saito]], usually spend substantial time practicing with both ''bokken'' and ''j\u014d'', under the names of ''[[aiki-ken]]'', and ''[[aiki-j\u014d]]'', respectively.\n\nThe founder developed many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional sword, spear and bayonet movements. Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).<ref name=\"SOS\">{{cite book\n| last = Ratti\n| first = Oscar\n| last2 = Westbrook\n| first2 = Adele\n| title = Secrets of the Samurai: The Martial Arts of Feudal Japan\n| publisher = Castle Books\n| year = 1973\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/secretsofsamurai00osca_0/page/23 23, 356\u2013359]\n| location = Edison, New Jersey\n| isbn = 978-0-7858-1073-5\n| url = https://archive.org/details/secretsofsamurai00osca_0/page/23\n}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple attackers and ''randori''===\nOne feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called ''taninzudori'', or ''taninzugake''.

For instance, an ''ura'' technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn [[Shodokan Aikido]], ''randori'' differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.

Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration. Additionally, the target may also become unbalanced while attempting to avoid a strike (by jerking the head back, for example) which may allow for an easier throw.<ref name=\"dynamic\">{{cite book\n| last = Shioda\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n| title = Dynamic Aikido\n| publisher = Kodansha International\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/dynamicaikido00shio_0/page/52 52\u201355]\n| year = 1968\n| isbn = 978-0-87011-301-7\n| url = https://archive.org/details/dynamicaikido00shio_0/page/52\n}}</ref>\nMany sayings about ''atemi'' are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Scott\n |first       = Nathan\n |title       = Teachings of Ueshiba Morihei Sensei\n |year        = 2000\n |url         = http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html\n |accessdate  = 1 February 2007\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231203238/http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html\n |archivedate = 31 December 2006\n |url-status     = dead\n\n}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"turning\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u8ee2\u63db"}, {"name": "3", "value": "tenkan"}]}, {"name": "cite journal\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Amdur"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Ellis"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Irimi"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Aikido Journal"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "17 October 2007"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"inside\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u5185"}, {"name": "3", "value": "uchi"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"outside\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u5916"}, {"name": "3", "value": "soto"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"front\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u8868"}, {"name": "3", "value": "omote"}]}, {"name": "Nihongo", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\"rear\""}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u88cf"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ura"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ja"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ja"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u5f53\u3066\u8eab"}]}, {"name": "cite book\n", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "G\u014dz\u014d"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Shioda"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Gozo Shioda"}, {"name": "others", "value": "Translated by Payet, Jacques"}, {"name": "author2", "value": "Johnston, Christopher"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Shindokan Books"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-9687791-2-5"}]}, {"name": "cite book\n", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Shioda"}, {"name": "first", "value": "G\u014dz\u014d"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Gozo Shioda"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Dynamic Aikido"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Kodansha International"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/dynamicaikido00shio_0/page/52 52\u201355]"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1968"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-87011-301-7"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/dynamicaikido00shio_0/page/52"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Scott"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Nathan"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Teachings of Ueshiba Morihei Sensei"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "1 February 2007"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20061231203238/http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "31 December 2006"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": "Weapons", "paragraphs": "[[Image:PRehse002-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Disarming an attacker using a {{Nihongo|\"sword taking\"|\u592a\u5200\u53d6\u308a|tachi-dori}} technique.]]\n\nWeapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff (''[[j\u014d]]'') (these techniques closely resemble the use of the bayonet, or [[J\u016bkend\u014d]]), the wooden sword (''[[bokken]]''), and the knife (''[[tant\u014d]]'').<ref>{{cite book| last = Dang\n| first = Phong\n| title = Aikido Weapons Techniques: The Wooden Sword, Stick, and Knife of Aikido\n| publisher = Charles E Tuttle Company\n| year = 2006\n| isbn = 978-0-8048-3641-8\n}}</ref> Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques, where either weapon-taking and/or weapon-retention may be taught.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.<ref name=\"Pranin-status quo\">{{cite journal| last = Pranin| first = Stanley| title = Challenging the Status Quo| journal = Aiki News| volume = 98| publisher = Aiki News| year = 1994| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=12| accessdate = 2 November 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231241/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=12| archivedate = 21 November 2007| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nConversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. According to Minoru Shibata of Aikido Journal, \"O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts.\"<ref name=\"Shibata-Dilemma\">{{cite journal| last = Shibata| first = Minoru J.| title = A Dilemma Deferred: An Identity Denied and Dismissed| journal = Aikido Journal | year = 2007| url = http://members.aikidojournal.com/public/a-dilemma-deferred-an-identity-denied-and-dismissed/| accessdate = 11 March 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231751/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=263| archivedate= 21 November 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional ''[[jujutsu]]'' or ''[[kenjutsu]]'' are diverging from what Ueshiba taught.
