Being in the [[Earth 616|mainstream continuity]] of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously, with a brief interruption in 1995, until its relaunch with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. [[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|A video game based on the comic book series]] was released in 2000 and [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|a film named after the comic book series]] was released July 3, 2012.\n\nAfter [[DC Comics]]' [[The New 52|relaunch]] of ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' with new No. 1 issues in 2011, it had been the highest-numbered American comic still in circulation until it was cancelled. The title ended its 50-year run as a continuously published comic with [[Dying Wish|issue#700]] in December 2012. It was replaced by ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.<ref name=\"SuperiorSM\">{{cite web|url= http://marvel.com/news/story/19523/marvel_now_qa_superior_spider-man|title= Marvel NOW!

Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' under the bombastic editor-publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to support himself and his frail [[Aunt May]]. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Liz Allan]] at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, [[Betty Brant]].\n\nBy focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, [[Jack Kirby]],<ref name=\"DeFalco87\" /> and combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.\n\nMost of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time.

Romita's Spider-Man \u2013 more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko's \u2013 became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[managing editor]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] in No. 52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain [[George Stacy]], father of Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], in No. 56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was [[Mary Jane Watson]], who made her first full appearance in No. 42, (Nov. 1966),<ref>DeFalco \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 119: \"After teasing the readers for more than two years, Stan Lee finally allowed Peter Parker to meet Mary Jane Watson.\"</ref> although she first appeared in No. 25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since No. 15 (Aug. 1964).

The stories became more topical,<ref>Manning \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 46: \"Stan Lee tackled the issues of the day again when, with artists John Romita and Jim Mooney, he dealt with social unrest at Empire State University.\"</ref> addressing issues such as [[civil rights]], racism, [[prisoners' rights]], the [[Vietnam War]], and [[Election|political elections]].\n\nIssue No. 50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],<ref>DeFalco \"1960s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 122: \"Stan Lee wanted to create a new kind of crime boss.

Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', likewise were given the dual numbering around this time.

Here, the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying [[Aunt May]] if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's tenure as writer.\n\nFollowing this, Marvel made ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with [[domino effect]] differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' No. 200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]).

Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[J. Michael Straczynski|Straczynski, J.

Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.\n\nIssue No. 30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', likewise were given the dual numbering around this time.

This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\", written partially by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]], running through ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544\u2013545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' No. 24 (Nov. 2007) and ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' No. 41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying [[Aunt May]] if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's tenure as writer.\n\nFollowing this, Marvel made ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with [[domino effect]] differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' No. 200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]). The alternating regular writers were initially [[Dan Slott]], [[Bob Gale]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Fred Van Lente]], and [[Zeb Wells]], joined by a rotation of artists that included [[Chris Bachalo]], [[Phil Jimenez]], [[Mike McKone]], [[John Romita Jr.]] and [[Marcos Mart\u00edn]].
