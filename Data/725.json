He was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period. After becoming a monk at the monastery at [[Winchester]], he was appointed [[Abbot]] of [[Tavistock Abbey]] in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served [[Edward the Confessor]], the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, [[Edward the Exile]], back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.\n\nIn 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so.<ref name=Edward208>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 208\u2013209</ref> As administrator of the [[Diocese of Hereford]], he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], a Welsh ruler.\n\nIn 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York, but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]] as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood.\n\nSome sources state that following King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned [[Harold Godwinson]] as King of England.<ref name=Hindley335>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 335</ref> Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Ealdred backed [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]] and then endorsed King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], the [[Duke of Normandy]] and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the time of his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "bots", "values": [{"name": "deny", "value": "InternetArchiveBot"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "11th-century abbot and Archbishop of York"}]}, {"name": "For", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "other people with the same name"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Ealdred"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Aldred (name)"}]}, {"name": "Infobox Christian leader\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Ealdred"}, {"name": "title", "value": "[[Archbishop of York]]"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Gloucester catedral anglosajon.JPG"}, {"name": "imagesize", "value": "250px"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "Interior view of a chamber, with arches supporting the pillars holding up the roof."}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Crypt of Gloucester Cathedral, which predates the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], and would have been contemporary with Ealdred's administration of [[Gloucester Abbey]]"}, {"name": "elected", "value": "25 December 1060"}, {"name": "ended", "value": "11 September 1069"}, {"name": "other_post", "value": "[[Abbot of Tavistock]]<br>[[Bishop of Worcester]]"}, {"name": "predecessor", "value": "[[Cynesige]]"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "[[Thomas of Bayeux]]"}, {"name": "consecration", "value": "1046"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "11 September 1069"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[York]]"}, {"name": "buried", "value": "[[York Minster]]"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Early life", "paragraphs": "Ealdred was probably born in the west of England, and could be related to [[Lyfing of Winchester|Lyfing]], his predecessor as bishop of Worcester.<ref name=DNB>Lawson \"Ealdred\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do.<ref name=King124>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 124</ref> Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became [[Abbot of Gloucester]].<ref name=DNB/> Ealdred was a monk in the [[cathedral chapter]] at [[Winchester Cathedral]] before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043.<ref name=Knowles72>Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 72</ref> Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death.<ref name=King124/> No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.<ref name=King125>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 125</ref>\n\nEaldred was made bishop of Worcester in 1046, a position he held until his resignation in 1062.<ref name=Handbook224>Fryde, et al.
