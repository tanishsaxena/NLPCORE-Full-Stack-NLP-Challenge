It has a population of 2,700. Its area is {{convert|148|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Achill is attached to the mainland by [[Michael Davitt Bridge]], between the villages of Gob an Choire ([[Achill Sound]]) and Poll Raithn\u00ed ([[Polranny]]). A [[bridge]] was first completed here in 1887, replaced by another structure in 1949, and subsequently replaced with the current bridge which was completed in 2008. Other centres of population include the villages of Keel, [[Dooagh]], Dumha \u00c9ige ([[Dooega]]), D\u00fan Ibhir ([[Dooniver]]), The Valley and Dugort. The parish's main [[Gaelic football]] pitch and [[secondary school]] are on the mainland at Poll Raithn\u00ed. Early [[human settlement]]s are believed to have been established on Achill around 3000 BC. A paddle dating from this period was found at the [[crann\u00f3g]] near Dookinella.\nThe island is 87% [[peat bog]].{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Thompson our-escort-into-glenaragh.jpg|thumbnail|\"Our Escort Into Glenaragh\", from the sketch book and diary of [[Elizabeth Thompson]].]]\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "redirect", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Achill"}, {"name": "2", "value": "the village on the island of Canna, Scotland"}, {"name": "3", "value": "A'Chill"}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Island off the western coast of Ireland, in County Mayo"}]}, {"name": "more citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "March 2018"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2012"}]}, {"name": "Infobox islands\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Achill"}, {"name": "image_name", "value": "Achillsatmap.jpg"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "View of the Island using [[NASA]]'s technology overhead"}, {"name": "map", "value": "Ireland"}, {"name": "coordinates", "value": "{{coords|53.96391|-10.00303|display=it}}"}, {"name": "native_name", "value": "Acaill, Oile\u00e1n Acla"}, {"name": "location", "value": "[[Atlantic Ocean]]"}, {"name": "archipelago", "value": "Achill"}, {"name": "total_islands", "value": "3 (Achill,Innisbiggle and Achillbeg islands)"}, {"name": "major_islands", "value": "Achill"}, {"name": "coastline_km", "value": "128"}, {"name": "highest_mount", "value": "[[Croaghaun]]"}, {"name": "elevation_m", "value": "688"}, {"name": "area_acre", "value": "36572"}, {"name": "country", "value": "[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]"}, {"name": "country_admin_divisions_title", "value": "[[Provinces of Ireland|Province]]"}, {"name": "country_admin_divisions", "value": "[[Connacht]]"}, {"name": "country_admin_divisions_title_1", "value": "[[Counties of Ireland|County]]"}, {"name": "country_admin_divisions_1", "value": "[[County Mayo|Mayo]]"}, {"name": "country_admin_divisions_title_2", "value": "[[Barony (Ireland)|Barony]]"}, {"name": "country_admin_divisions_2", "value": "[[Burrishoole]]"}, {"name": "population", "value": "2,569"}, {"name": "population_as_of", "value": "2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishislands.info/census/graphs/numbers.html|title=Island Change in Population, 1841 - 2011 |date=28 January 2013 }}</ref>"}, {"name": "density_km2", "value": "17.3"}, {"name": "ethnic_groups", "value": "[[Irish people|Irish]]"}, {"name": "additional_info", "value": "Ireland's largest island"}]}, {"name": "coords", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "53.96391"}, {"name": "2", "value": "-10.00303"}, {"name": "display", "value": "it"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://irishislands.info/census/graphs/numbers.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Island Change in Population, 1841 - 2011"}, {"name": "date", "value": "28 January 2013"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6"}, {"name": "3", "value": "k"}, {"name": "4", "value": "\u0259l"}]}, {"name": "lang-ga", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Acaill, Oile\u00e1n Acla"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "148"}, {"name": "2", "value": "km2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "sqmi"}, {"name": "abbr", "value": "on"}]}, {"name": "fact", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2019"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "It is believed that at the end of the [[Neolithic Period]] (around 4000 BC), Achill had a population of 500\u20131,000 people.

Offaly, Ireland|pages=1-6}}</ref>\n\n===Overlords===\nAchill Island lies in the Barony of [[Burrishoole]], in the territory of ancient [[Umaill|Umhall]] (Umhall Uactarach and Umhall Ioctarach), that originally encompassed an area extending from the [[County Galway]]/Mayo border to Achill Head.\n\nThe hereditary chieftains of Umhall were the O'Malleys, recorded in the area in 814 AD when they successfully repelled an onslaught by the Vikings in [[Clew Bay]]. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] invasion of [[Connacht]] in 1235 AD saw the territory of Umhall taken over by the Butlers and later by the de Burgos. The Butler Lordship of Burrishoole continued into the late 14th century when Thomas le Botiller was recorded as being in possession of Akkyll and Owyll.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Immigration===\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, there was much migration to Achill from other parts of Ireland, particularly [[Ulster]], due to the political and religious turmoil of the time. For a while there were two different [[dialect]]s of Irish being spoken on Achill. This led to many townlands being recorded as having two names during the 1824 [[Ordnance Survey]], and some maps today give different names for the same place. Achill Irish still has many traces of [[Ulster Irish]].\n\n===Specific historical sites and events===\n====Grace O'Malley's Castle====\n[[Carrickkildavnet Castle]] is a 15th-century tower house associated with the O'Malley Clan, who were once a ruling family of Achill. [[Grace O' Malley]], or Granuaile, the most famous of the O'Malleys, was born on [[Clare Island]] around 1530.<ref name= \"piratequeen\">{{cite news |last=Lynch |first=Peter |url= http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160615-the-pirate-queen-of-county-mayo |title=The Pirate Queen of County Mayo |work=[[BBC]] |date=2016-06-20 |accessdate=2017-02-02}}</ref> Her father was the chieftain of the barony of [[Murrisk]]. The O'Malleys were a powerful seafaring family, who traded widely. Grace became a fearless leader and gained fame as a sea captain and pirate. She is reputed to have met with [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1593. She died around 1603 and is buried in the O'Malley family tomb on Clare Island.\n\n====Achill Mission====\n[[File:The Colony, Achill (21330853923).jpg|thumbnail|left|View of the \"Colony\", prior to 1900.]]\nOne of Achill's most famous historical sites is that of the Achill Mission or 'the Colony' at Dugort. In 1831 the [[Church of Ireland]] Reverend [[Edward Nangle]] founded a [[proselytising]] mission at Dugort. The Mission included schools, cottages, an orphanage, an infirmary and a guesthouse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dugort, Achill Island 1831-1861|last=Ni Ghiobuin|first=Mealla C|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=2001|isbn=0716527405|location=Dublin|pages=7-21}}</ref>The Colony gave rise to mixed assessments, particularly during the Great Famine when charges of 'souperism' were leveled against Edward Nangle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Irish Famine: Impact, Ideology and Rebellion|last=Kinealy|first=Christine|publisher=Palgrave|year=2002|isbn=9780333677735|location=New York|pages=160-166}}</ref> For almost forty years Edward Nangle edited a newspaper called the ''Achill Missionary Herald and Western Witness'' which was printed in Achill. Nangle. expanded his mission into Mweelin in west Achill where a school, church, rectory, cottages and a training school were built. The Achill Mission began to decline slowly after Nangle was moved from Achill and was finally closed in the 1880s. When Edward Nangle died in 1883 there were opposing views on his legacy.\n\n====Railway====\nIn 1894, the Westport - Newport railway line was extended to Achill Sound. The railway station is now a hostel. The train provided a great service to Achill, but it also is said to have fulfilled an ancient prophecy. [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|Brian Rua O' Cearbhain]] had prophesied that 'carts on iron wheels' would carry bodies into Achill on their first and last journey. In 1894, the first train on the Achill railway carried the bodies of victims of the Clew Bay Drowning. This tragedy occurred when a boat overturned in Clew Bay, drowning thirty-two young people. They had been going to meet the steamer which would take them to Scotland for potato picking.\n\nThe Kirkintilloch Fire in 1937 almost fulfilled the second part of the prophecy when the bodies of ten victims were carried by rail to Achill. While it was not literally the last train, the railway would close just two weeks later. These people had died in a fire in a [[bothy]] in [[Kirkintilloch]]. This term referred to the temporary accommodation provided for those who went to Scotland to pick potatoes, a migratory pattern that had been established in the early nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Memorial for the victims of the Clew Bay Drowning on 15 June 1894 at Kildavenet Graveyard, Achill Island.jpg|thumb|Memorial for the victims of the Clew Bay Drowning on 15 June 1894 at Kildavenet Graveyard]]\n\n====Kildamhnait====\nKildamhnait on the south-east coast of Achill is named after St. Damhnait, or [[Dymphna]], who founded a church there in the 16th century. There is also a holy well just outside the graveyard. The present church was built in the 1700s and the graveyard contains memorials to the victims of two of Achill's greatest tragedies, the Kirchintilloch Fire (1937) and the Clew Bay Drowning (1894).\n\n====The Monastery====\nIn 1852, Dr. John McHale, Archbishop of Tuam purchased land in Bunnacurry which became the location of a Franciscan Monastery which, for many years provided an education for local children. The ruins of this monastery are still to be seen in Bunnacurry today.\n\n====The Valley House====\nThe historic Valley House is located in The Valley, near Dugort in the north-east of Achill Island. The present building sits on the site of a hunting lodge built by the Earl of Cavan in the 19th century. Its notoriety arises from an incident in 1894 in which the then owner, an English landlady named Agnes McDonnell, was savagely beaten and the house set alight, allegedly by a local man, James Lynchehaun. Lynchehaun had been employed by McDonnell as her land agent, but the two fell out and he was sacked and told to quit his accommodation on her estate. A lengthy legal battle ensued, with Lynchehaun refusing to leave. At the time, in the 1890s, the issue of land ownership in Ireland was politically charged, and after the events at the Valley House in 1895 Lynchehaun was to claim that his actions were motivated by politics. He escaped custody and fled to the United States, where he successfully defeated legal attempts by the British authorities to have him extradited to face charges arising from the attack and the burning of the Valley House. Agnes McDonnell suffered terrible injuries from the attack but survived and lived for another 23 years, dying in 1923. Lynchehaun is said to have returned to Achill on two occasions, once in disguise as an American tourist, and eventually died in Girvan, Scotland, in 1937. The Valley House is now a Hostel and Bar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Veiled Woman of Achill: Island Outrage and A Playboy Drama|last=Byrne|first=Patricia|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2012|isbn=9781848891470|location=Cork, Ireland|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:Deserted village - Achill.jpg|thumb|View of the deserted village from beside the ruins of one of the houses]]\n[[File:Inside deserted house - Achill.jpg|thumb|Inside the ruins of one of the houses at the deserted village]]\n\n====The Deserted Village====\nClose by Dugort, at the base of [[Slievemore]] mountain lies the Deserted Village. There are approximately 80 ruined houses in the village.\n\nThe houses were built of unmortared stone, which means that no cement or mortar was used to hold the stones together. Each house consisted of just one room and this room was used as a kitchen, living room, bedroom and even a stable.\n\nIf one looks at the fields around the Deserted Village and right up the mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like potatoes were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.\n\nFor many years people lived in the village and then in 1845 Famine struck in Achill as it did in the rest of Ireland. Most of the families moved to the nearby village of Dooagh, which is beside the sea, while some others emigrated. Living beside the sea meant that fish and shellfish could be used for food. The village was completely abandoned which is where the name 'Deserted Village' came from.\n\nNo-one has lived in these houses since the time of the Famine, however, the families that moved to Dooagh and their descendants, continued to use the village as a 'booley village'. This means that during the summer season, the younger members of the family, teenage boys and girls, would take the cattle to graze on the hillside and they would stay in the houses of the Deserted Village. This custom continued until the 1940s. Boolying was also carried out in other areas of Achill, including Annagh on Croaghaun mountain and in Curraun.\n\nAt Ailt, Kildownet, you can see the remains of a similar deserted village. This village was deserted in 1855 when the tenants were evicted by the local landlord so the land could be used for cattle grazing; the tenants were forced to rent holdings in Currane, Dooega and Slievemore. Others emigrated to America.\n\n===Archaeology===\n[[File:KeemBayAchillJune.JPG|thumb|[[Keem Bay]]]]Achill Archaeological Field School is based at the Achill Archaeology Centre in Dooagh, which has served as a catalyst for a wide array of archaeological investigations on the island. It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]. Since 1991, several thousand students from 21 countries have come to Achill to study and participate in ongoing excavations. The school is involved in a study of the prehistoric and historic landscape at [[Slievemore]], incorporating a research excavation at a number of sites within the deserted village of Slievemore. Slievemore is rich in archaeological monuments that span a 5,000 year period from the [[Neolithic]] to the Post Medieval.<ref>{{cite web | title=Achill Archaeological Field School 2009 | work=Achill Archaeological Field School | url=http://www.achill-fieldschool.com/ | accessdate=7 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228224527/http://www.achill-fieldschool.com/| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Recent archaeological  research suggests the village was occupied year-round at least as early as the 19th century, though it is known to have served as a seasonally occupied 'booley village' by the first half of the 20th century. A booley village (a number of which exist in a ruined state on the island) is a village occupied only during part of the year, such as a resort community, a [[lake]] community, or (as the case on Achill) a place to live while [[Transhumance|tending flocks or herds]] of [[ruminant]]s during winter or summer [[pasture|pasturing]].<ref>[http://www.achill247.com/pictures/slievemore-7.html ''Deserted village, Slievemore, Achill Island'', achill247.com] Retrieved on 17 February 2008.</ref> Specifically, some of the people of Dooagh and Pollagh would migrate in the summer to Slievemore and then go back to Dooagh in the autumn. The summer 2009 field school excavated Round House 2 on Slievemore Mountain under the direction of archaeologist Stuart Rathbone.  Only the outside north wall, entrance way and inside of the Round House were completely excavated.<ref>Amanda Burt, member of Achill Field School, Summer 2009.</ref>\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, the Achill Island Maritime Archaeology Project directed by [[Chuck Meide]] was sponsored by the [[College of William and Mary]], the Institute of Maritime History, the Achill Folklife Centre (now the Achill Archaeology Centre), and the [[St. Augustine Light|Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)]]. This project focused on the documentation of archaeological resources related to Achill's rich maritime heritage.  Maritime archaeologists recorded a 19th-century fishing station, an ice house, boat house ruins, a number of anchors which had been salvaged from the sea, 19th-century and more recent [[currach]] pens, a number of traditional vernacular watercraft including a possibly 100-year-old Achill yawl, and the remains of four historic shipwrecks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimehistory.org/content/achill-island-maritime-archaeology-project |title=Achill Island Maritime Archaeology Project &#124; Institute of Maritime History |publisher=Maritimehistory.org |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Meide, Chuck and Kathryn Sikes (2014) Manipulating the Maritime Cultural Landscape: Vernacular Boats and Economic Relations on Nineteenth-Century Achill Island, Ireland.

In 1831 the [[Church of Ireland]] Reverend [[Edward Nangle]] founded a [[proselytising]] mission at Dugort. The Mission included schools, cottages, an orphanage, an infirmary and a guesthouse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dugort, Achill Island 1831-1861|last=Ni Ghiobuin|first=Mealla C|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=2001|isbn=0716527405|location=Dublin|pages=7-21}}</ref>The Colony gave rise to mixed assessments, particularly during the Great Famine when charges of 'souperism' were leveled against Edward Nangle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Irish Famine: Impact, Ideology and Rebellion|last=Kinealy|first=Christine|publisher=Palgrave|year=2002|isbn=9780333677735|location=New York|pages=160-166}}</ref> For almost forty years Edward Nangle edited a newspaper called the ''Achill Missionary Herald and Western Witness'' which was printed in Achill. Nangle. expanded his mission into Mweelin in west Achill where a school, church, rectory, cottages and a training school were built. The Achill Mission began to decline slowly after Nangle was moved from Achill and was finally closed in the 1880s. When Edward Nangle died in 1883 there were opposing views on his legacy.\n\n====Railway====\nIn 1894, the Westport - Newport railway line was extended to Achill Sound. The railway station is now a hostel. The train provided a great service to Achill, but it also is said to have fulfilled an ancient prophecy. [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|Brian Rua O' Cearbhain]] had prophesied that 'carts on iron wheels' would carry bodies into Achill on their first and last journey. In 1894, the first train on the Achill railway carried the bodies of victims of the Clew Bay Drowning. This tragedy occurred when a boat overturned in Clew Bay, drowning thirty-two young people. They had been going to meet the steamer which would take them to Scotland for potato picking.\n\nThe Kirkintilloch Fire in 1937 almost fulfilled the second part of the prophecy when the bodies of ten victims were carried by rail to Achill. While it was not literally the last train, the railway would close just two weeks later. These people had died in a fire in a [[bothy]] in [[Kirkintilloch]]. This term referred to the temporary accommodation provided for those who went to Scotland to pick potatoes, a migratory pattern that had been established in the early nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Memorial for the victims of the Clew Bay Drowning on 15 June 1894 at Kildavenet Graveyard, Achill Island.jpg|thumb|Memorial for the victims of the Clew Bay Drowning on 15 June 1894 at Kildavenet Graveyard]]\n\n====Kildamhnait====\nKildamhnait on the south-east coast of Achill is named after St. Damhnait, or [[Dymphna]], who founded a church there in the 16th century. There is also a holy well just outside the graveyard. The present church was built in the 1700s and the graveyard contains memorials to the victims of two of Achill's greatest tragedies, the Kirchintilloch Fire (1937) and the Clew Bay Drowning (1894).\n\n====The Monastery====\nIn 1852, Dr. John McHale, Archbishop of Tuam purchased land in Bunnacurry which became the location of a Franciscan Monastery which, for many years provided an education for local children. The ruins of this monastery are still to be seen in Bunnacurry today.\n\n====The Valley House====\nThe historic Valley House is located in The Valley, near Dugort in the north-east of Achill Island. The present building sits on the site of a hunting lodge built by the Earl of Cavan in the 19th century. Its notoriety arises from an incident in 1894 in which the then owner, an English landlady named Agnes McDonnell, was savagely beaten and the house set alight, allegedly by a local man, James Lynchehaun. Lynchehaun had been employed by McDonnell as her land agent, but the two fell out and he was sacked and told to quit his accommodation on her estate. A lengthy legal battle ensued, with Lynchehaun refusing to leave. At the time, in the 1890s, the issue of land ownership in Ireland was politically charged, and after the events at the Valley House in 1895 Lynchehaun was to claim that his actions were motivated by politics. He escaped custody and fled to the United States, where he successfully defeated legal attempts by the British authorities to have him extradited to face charges arising from the attack and the burning of the Valley House. Agnes McDonnell suffered terrible injuries from the attack but survived and lived for another 23 years, dying in 1923. Lynchehaun is said to have returned to Achill on two occasions, once in disguise as an American tourist, and eventually died in Girvan, Scotland, in 1937. The Valley House is now a Hostel and Bar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Veiled Woman of Achill: Island Outrage and A Playboy Drama|last=Byrne|first=Patricia|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2012|isbn=9781848891470|location=Cork, Ireland|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:Deserted village - Achill.jpg|thumb|View of the deserted village from beside the ruins of one of the houses]]\n[[File:Inside deserted house - Achill.jpg|thumb|Inside the ruins of one of the houses at the deserted village]]\n\n====The Deserted Village====\nClose by Dugort, at the base of [[Slievemore]] mountain lies the Deserted Village. There are approximately 80 ruined houses in the village.\n\nThe houses were built of unmortared stone, which means that no cement or mortar was used to hold the stones together. Each house consisted of just one room and this room was used as a kitchen, living room, bedroom and even a stable.\n\nIf one looks at the fields around the Deserted Village and right up the mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like potatoes were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.\n\nFor many years people lived in the village and then in 1845 Famine struck in Achill as it did in the rest of Ireland. Most of the families moved to the nearby village of Dooagh, which is beside the sea, while some others emigrated. Living beside the sea meant that fish and shellfish could be used for food. The village was completely abandoned which is where the name 'Deserted Village' came from.\n\nNo-one has lived in these houses since the time of the Famine, however, the families that moved to Dooagh and their descendants, continued to use the village as a 'booley village'. This means that during the summer season, the younger members of the family, teenage boys and girls, would take the cattle to graze on the hillside and they would stay in the houses of the Deserted Village. This custom continued until the 1940s. Boolying was also carried out in other areas of Achill, including Annagh on Croaghaun mountain and in Curraun.\n\nAt Ailt, Kildownet, you can see the remains of a similar deserted village. This village was deserted in 1855 when the tenants were evicted by the local landlord so the land could be used for cattle grazing; the tenants were forced to rent holdings in Currane, Dooega and Slievemore. Others emigrated to America.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Lynch"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Peter"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160615-the-pirate-queen-of-county-mayo"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Pirate Queen of County Mayo"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[BBC]]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2016-06-20"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2017-02-02"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Dugort, Achill Island 1831-1861"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Ni Ghiobuin"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Mealla C"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Irish Academic Press"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0716527405"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Dublin"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "7-21"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Great Irish Famine: Impact, Ideology and Rebellion"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Kinealy"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Christine"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Palgrave"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780333677735"}, {"name": "location", "value": "New York"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "160-166"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Veiled Woman of Achill: Island Outrage and A Playboy Drama"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Byrne"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Patricia"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "The Collins Press"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2012"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781848891470"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Cork, Ireland"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Grace O'Malley's Castle", "paragraphs": "[[Carrickkildavnet Castle]] is a 15th-century tower house associated with the O'Malley Clan, who were once a ruling family of Achill.
