Cyan gave it to Delman, who finished the design and first used it for ''Lunar Lander''. Logg received Delman's modified board with five buttons, 13 sound effects, and additional RAM, and used it to develop ''Asteroids''. The size of the board was 4 by 4 inches, and it was \"linked up\" to a monitor.<ref name=\"WiredEdLogg\"/><ref name=\"RetroGamerAsteroids\"/>\n\nLogg modeled the player's ship, the five-button control scheme, and the game physics after ''Spacewar!'', which he had played as a student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but made several changes to improve playability.

Logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype, so he created a second prototype specifically for staff to play.<ref name=\"RetroGamerAsteroids\"/><ref name=\"ClassicGamingAsteroids\"/> Atari went to Sacramento, California for testing, setting up prototypes of the game in local arcades to measure its potential success. The company also observed veteran players and younger players during focus group sessions at Atari itself. A group of old players familiar with ''Spacewar!'' struggled to maintain grip on the thrust button and requested a joystick, whereas younger players accustomed to ''[[Space Invaders]]'' noted they get no break in the game. Logg and other Atari engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages.<ref name=\"RetroGamerAsteroids\"/>\n<!-- HIDDEN BECAUSE OF NO EASY RELIABLE SOURCE: ''Asteroids'' uses only 6 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code. Another 2 KB of vector ROM contains the descriptions of the main graphical elements (rocks, saucer, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits) in the form of DVG commands. For each picture frame, the 6502 writes graphics commands for the DVG into a defined area of [[RAM]] (the vector RAM), and then asks the DVG to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen. The DVG reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor. There are DVG commands for positioning the cathode ray, for drawing a line to a specified destination, calling a subroutine with further commands, and so on.  It features various sound effects, each of which is implemented by its own circuitry. There are seven distinct audio circuits designed by Delman. The CPU activates these audio circuits (and other hardware components) by writing to special memory addresses (memory mapped ports).
