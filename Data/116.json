Later, in ''Crome Yellow'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 [[John Middleton Murry]] was reorganising the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.<ref>{{citation |title=The Huxleys |first=Ronald W |last=Clark |publisher=William Heinemann |place=London |year=1968}}.</ref> They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).<ref>{{cite book |first=George |last=Woodcock |year=2007 |title=Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley |page=240 |publisher=Black Rose Books}}.</ref>\n\nWorks of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''Brave New World'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]], and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.\n\nBeginning in this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate=6 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Life in the United States ===\nIn 1937 Huxley moved to [[Hollywood]] with his wife Maria, son [[Matthew Huxley]], and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, and also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.\n\nHeard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. Huxley and Krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange (sometimes edging on debate) over many years, with Krishnamurti representing the more rarefied, detached, ivory-tower perspective and Huxley, with his pragmatic concerns, the more socially and historically informed position. Huxley provided an introduction to Krishnamurti's quintessential statement, ''The First and Last Freedom'' (1954).<ref>Vernon, Roland (2000) ''Star in the East'', pp. 204-207. Sentient Publications: Boulder, CO</ref>\n\nHuxley also became a Vedantist in the circle of [[Hindu]] [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long afterward, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted \"five senses\" and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.\n\nHuxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of [[Los Angeles]]. The college appears as \"Tarzana College\" in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.<ref>Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009</ref> Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.\n\nDuring this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''My Guru and His Disciple'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the US. In March 1938, Huxley's friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), which hired him for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). He was commissioned by [[Walt Disney]] in 1945 to write a script based on ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and the biography of the story's author, [[Lewis Carroll]]. The script was not used, however.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/ |title=7 unproduced screenplays by famous intellectuals |date=2010-04-15 |work=Salon |access-date=2018-02-25 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHuxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of [[J.

From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall semester of 1960, Huxley was invited by Professor [[Huston Smith]] to be the Carnegie Visiting Professor of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).<ref>[https://www.lionsroar.com/huston-smith-fifty-years-on-the-razors-edge/ Interview of Huston Smith]</ref> As part of the MIT centennial program of events organized by the Department of Humanities, Huxley presented a series of lectures titled, \"What a Piece of Work is a Man\" which concerned history, language, and art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/761|title=Aldous Huxley lecture series, \"What a Piece of Work Is a Man\"|last=|first=|date=|website=archivesspace.mit.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-World War II life ===\nIn 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the U.S. and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]], the judge had to adjourn the proceedings.<ref name=\"Reiff2009\">{{cite book|author=Raychel Haugrud Reiff|title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JyRntokmqYC&pg=PA31|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4701-6|page=31}}</ref><ref name=\"Murray2009\">{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Nicholas|title=Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h7CKgXGDi4C&pg=PT309|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1231-9|page=309}}</ref> He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the U.S. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957\u20131963)|Macmillan government]] without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.<ref>''The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall semester of 1960, Huxley was invited by Professor [[Huston Smith]] to be the Carnegie Visiting Professor of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).<ref>[https://www.lionsroar.com/huston-smith-fifty-years-on-the-razors-edge/ Interview of Huston Smith]</ref> As part of the MIT centennial program of events organized by the Department of Humanities, Huxley presented a series of lectures titled, \"What a Piece of Work is a Man\" which concerned history, language, and art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/761|title=Aldous Huxley lecture series, \"What a Piece of Work Is a Man\"|last=|first=|date=|website=archivesspace.mit.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "7 unproduced screenplays by famous intellectuals"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2010-04-15"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Salon"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-02-25"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en-US"}]}, {"name": "citation ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "JD"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Unwin"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1940"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oscar Piest"}, {"name": "place", "value": "NY"}]}, {"name": "Quote ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and [[wikt:narcohypnosis|narcohypnosis]] are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0-7011-1312-4}}</ref>"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Huxley"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Aldous"}, {"name": "editor", "value": "Grover Smith"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Letters of Aldous Huxley"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1969"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Chatto & Windus"}, {"name": "location", "value": "London"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-7011-1312-4"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958)"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "YouTube"}, {"name": "date", "value": "25 July 2011"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "8 March 2013"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/761"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Aldous Huxley lecture series, \"What a Piece of Work Is a Man\""}, {"name": "website", "value": "archivesspace.mit.edu"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2019-09-27"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": " Post-World War II life ", "paragraphs": "In 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination.

In about 1939 Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northern [[Los Angeles County]]. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley Annual |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYFcahCQm4wC&pg=PA109 |publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster |date=28 February 2011 |isbn=978-3-643-10450-2 |language=en |first=Bernfried |last=Nugel |first2=Jerome |last2=Meckier |page=111 |chapter=A New Look at The Art of Seeing}}</ref>\n\nIt was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since [[#Aldous Huxley eye disease|the illness in his teens]], despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: \"Then suddenly he faltered\u2014and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes.
