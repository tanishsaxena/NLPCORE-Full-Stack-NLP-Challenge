In the special case of [[aqueous solutions]], proton donors form the [[hydronium ion]] H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and are known as [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius acids]]. [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted|Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry|Lowry]] generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H<sup>+</sup>.\n\nAqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid.<ref>Petrucci R.H., Harwood, R.S. and Herring, F.G.

The word ''acid'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''acidus/ac\u0113re'' meaning ''sour''.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']</ref> An aqueous solution of an acid has a [[pH]] less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition refers only to the [[solution|solute]].<ref name=\"IUPAC_acid\"/> A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of [[Hydron (chemistry)|positive hydrogen ions]] in the [[solution]]. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.\n\nCommon aqueous acids include [[hydrochloric acid]] (a solution of [[hydrogen chloride]] which is found in [[gastric acid]] in the stomach and activates [[digestive enzymes]]), [[acetic acid]] (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[citric acid]] (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict<ref name=\"IUPAC_acid\"/> sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. [[Acid strength|Strong acid]]s and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].\n\nThe second category of acids are [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acids]], which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>), whose boron atom has a vacant [[atomic orbital|orbital]] which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>). [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Lewis]] considered this as a generalization of the Br\u00f8nsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly ''or'' by releasing protons (H<sup>+</sup>) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\">Oxtoby, D.

Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.\n\nAn Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]], on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) ions when dissolved in water. This decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form H<sub>2</sub>O molecules:\n\nH<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + OH{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} \u21cc H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nDue to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.\n\nIn an acidic solution, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10<sup>\u22127</sup> [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter.

In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Br\u00f8nsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory.

In the second example CH<sub>3</sub>COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is both an Arrhenius and a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid.\n\nBr\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of [[molecule|molecular compounds]] in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions.

The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH<sub>3</sub> combine to form the solid.\n\n===Lewis acids===\n{{main|Lewis acids and bases}}\nA third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N.

Fluoride \"loses\" a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B\u2014F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Br\u00f8nsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Br\u00f8nsted acid to ammonia, a Br\u00f8nsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> gains a pair of electrons when one of the H\u2014O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen.

Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA<sup>+</sup> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H<sub>2</sub>O] means ''the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>a</sub> is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H<sup>+</sup>.\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac\\ce{[H+] [A^-]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nThe stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''<sub>a</sub> than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''<sub>a</sub> spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''<sub>a</sub> is more frequently used, where p''K''<sub>a</sub> = &minus;log<sub>10</sub> ''K''<sub>a</sub>. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids.

A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H<sup>+</sup> and one mole of the conjugate base, A<sup>\u2212</sup>, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H<sup>+</sup>. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H\u2014A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H\u2014A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.\n\nStronger acids have a larger ''K''<sub>a</sub> and a more negative p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids.\n\nSulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.\n\n[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] \"salts\". They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.\n\nWhile ''K''<sub>a</sub> measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.  The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ''K''<sub>a</sub>.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Acid strength"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Chemical characteristics", "paragraphs": "\n===Monoprotic acids===\nMonoprotic acids, also known as monobasic acids, are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):\n:HA<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a</sub>\n\nCommon examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>).

Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive ''K''<sub>a</sub> values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.\n\nAlthough the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution.

For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H<sub>2</sub>A, HA<sup>\u2212</sup>, and A<sup>2\u2212</sup>.

It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.\n\nNeutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].\n\n===Weak acid\u2013weak base equilibrium===\n{{main|Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation}}\nIn order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p''K''<sub>a</sub> of the acid. The decreased concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H<sup>+</sup> concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.\n\nSolutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "+"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "H<sub>2</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "+"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "+"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "2\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "4"}, {"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "4"}, {"name": "p", "value": "2\u2212"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "(H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "(HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}})"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "3"}, {"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "3"}, {"name": "p", "value": "2\u2212"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "H<sub>3</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "+"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "+"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "2\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=3\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a3</sub>"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "2\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "+"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "p", "value": "3\u2212"}, {"name": "b", "value": "(aq)"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "4"}, {"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "4"}, {"name": "p", "value": "2\u2212"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "4"}, {"name": "p", "value": "3\u2212"}]}, {"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Acid dissociation constant#Polyprotic acids"}]}, {"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Monoprotic acids", "paragraphs": "Monoprotic acids, also known as monobasic acids, are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):\n:HA<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a</sub>\n\nCommon examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>).

The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H<sup>+</sup>]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:\n:<math chem>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha_\\ce{H2A}   &= \\frac{\\ce{[H+]^2}}{\\ce{[H+]^2}  + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}  = \\frac{\\ce{[H2A]}}{\\ce{{[H2A]}} + [HA^-] + [A^{2-}]}\\\\ \n\\alpha_\\ce{HA^-}  &= \\frac{[\\ce{H+}]K_1}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}  = \\frac{\\ce{[HA^-]}}{\\ce{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\\\\\n\\alpha_\\ce{A^{2-}}&= \\frac{K_1 K_2}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2} = \\frac{\\ce{[A^{2-}]}}{\\ce{{[H2A]}}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\n\\end{align}</math>\nA plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub>, is known as a [[Bjerrum plot]].

Many of those acids are [[amino acids]] which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = 8 - Biological roles of amino acids and peptides - University Publishing Online|url = http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139163828&cid=CBO9781139163828A114|website = ebooks.cambridge.org|access-date = 2016-02-06|doi = 10.1017/CBO9781139163828}}</ref> Other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the body's pH from undergoing large scale changes which would be harmful to cells.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html|title = Acid Buffering|date = 2006|access-date = 2016-02-06|website = Acid Base Online Tutorial|publisher = University of Connecticut|last = Graham|first = Timur|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213132105/http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html|archive-date = 13 February 2016|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite journal", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "8 - Biological roles of amino acids and peptides - University Publishing Online"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139163828&cid=CBO9781139163828A114"}, {"name": "website", "value": "ebooks.cambridge.org"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2016-02-06"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1017/CBO9781139163828"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Acid Buffering"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2016-02-06"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Acid Base Online Tutorial"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Connecticut"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Graham"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Timur"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160213132105/http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "13 February 2016"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "df", "value": "dmy-all"}]}], "id": 20}, {"title": "Acid catalysis", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Acid catalysis}}\nAcids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline.

[[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].\n\nAn \u03b1-amino acid has a central carbon (the \u03b1 or [[alpha and beta carbon|''alpha'' carbon]]) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|<small>L</small>-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some bacterial [[cell wall]]s contains some <small>D</small>-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO<sup>\u2212</sup>) and the basic amine group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) gains a proton (-NH{{su|b=3|p=+}}). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of \u22121 at physiological pH.\n\nFatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] \"head\" groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.\n\nIn humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].\n\nAcid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O<sub>2</sub>) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and fat, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO<sub>2</sub> exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.\n: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}\nIt is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO<sub>2</sub> and resupplying the cells with O<sub>2</sub>.\n\n[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "3"}, {"name": "p", "value": "+"}]}, {"name": "su", "values": [{"name": "b", "value": "3"}, {"name": "p", "value": "\u2212"}]}], "id": 22}, {"title": "Common acids", "paragraphs": "\n===Mineral acids (inorganic acids)===\n* [[Hydrogen halides]] and their solutions: [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF), [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI)\n* Halogen oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), [[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>), [[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), and corresponding analogs for bromine and iodine\n** [[Hypofluorous acid]] (HFO), the only known oxoacid for fluorine.\n* [[Sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluorosulfuric acid]] (HSO<sub>3</sub>F)\n* [[Nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Phosphoric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroantimonic acid]] (HSbF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroboric acid]] (HBF<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Hexafluorophosphoric acid]] (HPF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Chromic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Boric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>)\n\n===Sulfonic acids===\nA [[sulfonic acid]] has the general formula RS(=O)<sub>2</sub>\u2013OH, where R is an organic radical.\n* [[Methanesulfonic acid]] (or mesylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Ethanesulfonic acid]] (or esylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Benzenesulfonic acid]] (or besylic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[p-Toluenesulfonic acid]] (or tosylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] (or triflic acid, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Polystyrene sulfonic acid]] (sulfonated [[polystyrene]], [CH<sub>2</sub>CH(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)SO<sub>3</sub>H]<sub>n</sub>)\n\n===Carboxylic acids===\nA [[carboxylic acid]] has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.
