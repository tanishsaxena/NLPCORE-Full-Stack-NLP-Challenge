He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination ''Old Text'') that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the ''[[Xuanxue]]'' (mysterious learning), also called ''Neo-Taoism''. The most important philosophers of this movement were [[Wang Bi]], [[Xiang Xiu]] and [[Guo Xiang]]. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, ''ming'' and ''wuming''). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], was the concept of ''[[feng liu]]'' (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.\n\n[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|Northern and Southern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about [[Laozi]], founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to [[Buddha]]. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was far more successful in China than its rival [[Hinayana]], and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were [[Sengzhao]] and [[Daosheng]]. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the [[Zen]] sect.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5},

redirects here-->", "paragraphs": "{{main article|Indian philosophy}}\n\nThe '''ancient Indian philosophy'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> is a fusion of two ancient traditions: the Vedic tradition and the [[Sramana]] tradition.\n\n===Vedic philosophy===\nIndian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' wherein questions pertaining to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. In the famous [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] ''[[Hymn of Creation]]'' ([[Nasadiya Sukta]]) the poet asks:\n[[File:Sanjayas's Foreknowledge.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Vyasa]], at middle of the picture]]\n: \"Whence all creation had its origin,\n: he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,\n: he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,\n: he knows\u2014or maybe even he does not know.\"\n\nIn the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (''Purusha''). This leads to the inquiry into ''the one being'' that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed ''rta'' and causal law by ''karma''. Nature (''prakriti'') is taken to have three qualities (''[[sattva]]'', ''[[rajas]]'', and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'').\n* [[Vedas]]\n* [[Upanishads]]\n* [[Hindu philosophy]]\n\n===Sramana philosophy===\n{{main article|Jain philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Sramana}}\n[[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]] (Sanskrit: \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0915) (atheist) philosophy,  also known as Lok\u0101yata, it is a system of Hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is named after its founder, C\u0101rv\u0101ka, author of the B\u0101rhaspatya-s\u016btras.\n\n===Classical Indian philosophy===\nIn classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. Some of the questions asked were:\n* What is the ontological nature of consciousness?\n* How is cognition itself experienced?\n* Is mind (''chit'') intentional or not?\n* Does cognition have its own structure?\n\nThe six schools of [[Indian philosophy]] are:\n* [[Nyaya]]\n* [[Vaisheshika]]\n* [[Samkhya]]\n* [[R\u0101ja yoga|Yoga]]\n* [[Mimamsa]] (Purva Mimamsa)\n* [[Vedanta]] (Uttara Mimamsa)\n\n===Ancient Indian philosophers===\n{{main article|Timeline of Eastern philosophers#Indian philosophers}}\n\n====1st millennium BCE====\n* [[Parashara]] &mdash; writer of ''[[Vishnu Purana|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a]]''.\n\n====Philosophers of Vedic Age (c. 1500 \u2013 c. 600 BCE)====\n* Rishi Narayana &mdash; seer of the Purusha Sukta of the [[Rig Veda]].<ref>The significance of Purusha Sukta in [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pur.html Daily Invocations] by Swami Krishnananda</ref>\n* [[Saptarishi|Seven Rishis]] &mdash; Atri, Bharadwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, Viswamitra.<ref>P. 285 ''Indian sociology through Ghurye, a dictionary'' By S.
