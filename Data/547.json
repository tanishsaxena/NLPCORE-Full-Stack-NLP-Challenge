It was designed by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaud\u00ed and has been refurbished several times after that. Gaud\u00ed's assistants [[Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es i Gras]], Josep Canaleta and [[Joan Rubi\u00f3]] also contributed to the renovation project. \n\nThe local name for the building is ''Casa dels ossos'' (House of Bones), as it has a [[viscera]]l, [[skeleton|skeletal]] organic quality. It is located on the [[Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia]] in the [[Eixample]] district, and forms part of a row of houses known as the ''[[Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia]]''  (or ''Mansana de la Disc\u00f2rdia'', the \"Block of Discord\"), which consists of four buildings by noted ''[[Modernisme|Modernista]]'' architects of Barcelona.<ref name=\"hughes\">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Robert |title=Barcelona |date=2001 |publisher=Harvill Press |isbn=9781860468247 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&lpg=PP1&dq=Illa%20de%20la%20Disc%C3%B2rdia&pg=PA408#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=11 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nLike everything Gaud\u00ed designed, Casa Batll\u00f3 is only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, has unusual [[tracery]], irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a colorful [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]). The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Expand Catalan", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2012"}, {"name": "1", "value": "Casa Batll\u00f3"}]}, {"name": "Expand French", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2013"}, {"name": "1", "value": "Casa Batll\u00f3"}, {"name": "topic", "value": "struct"}]}, {"name": "Infobox building\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Casa Batll\u00f3"}, {"name": "native_name", "value": "Casa Batll\u00f3"}, {"name": "former_names", "value": "House of bones"}, {"name": "alternate_names", "value": "''Casa dels ossos'' (House of Bones)"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Casa Batllo Overview Barcelona Spain cut.jpg"}, {"name": "image_alt", "value": "Casa Batll\u00f3"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Casa Batll\u00f3"}, {"name": "map_type", "value": "Spain Barcelona"}, {"name": "material", "value": "stones, metal, wood, ceramic and colours"}, {"name": "location_town", "value": "[[Barcelona]]"}, {"name": "location_country", "value": "[[Spain]]"}, {"name": "coordinates", "value": "{{coord|41|23|30|N|2|09|54|E|region:ES-CT_scale:5000_type:landmark|display=title}}"}, {"name": "ren_architect", "value": "[[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]"}, {"name": "ren_oth_designers", "value": "[[Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es i Gras]], Josep Canaleta, [[Joan Rubi\u00f3]]"}, {"name": "website", "value": "[http://www.casabatllo.cat casabatllo.cat]"}]}, {"name": "coord", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "41"}, {"name": "2", "value": "23"}, {"name": "3", "value": "30"}, {"name": "4", "value": "N"}, {"name": "5", "value": "2"}, {"name": "6", "value": "09"}, {"name": "7", "value": "54"}, {"name": "8", "value": "E"}, {"name": "9", "value": "region:ES-CT_scale:5000_type:landmark"}, {"name": "display", "value": "title"}]}, {"name": "IPA-ca", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u02c8kaz\u0259 \u03b2\u0259\u02c8\u028e\u02d0o"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Hughes"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Robert"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Barcelona"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Harvill Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781860468247"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&lpg=PP1&dq=Illa%20de%20la%20Disc%C3%B2rdia&pg=PA408#v=onepage&q&f=false"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "11 June 2019"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "\n===Initial construction (1877)===\n[[File:Gaud%C3%AD_(1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antoni Gaud\u00ed in 1910]]\nThe building that is now Casa Batll\u00f3  was built in 1877, commissioned by Llu\u00eds Sala S\u00e1nchez.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bassegoda i Nonell |first= Joan |title= La Casa Batll\u00f3 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/La_Casa_Batll%C3%B3.html?id=kJ5oMwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y |accessdate= March 8, 2012|year=2001 |publisher= Publicaciones de la Real C\u00e1tedra Gaud\u00ed |location=Barcelona |page=4 |language=Spanish}}</ref> It was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the [[eclecticism]] traditional by the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bassegoda i Nonell |first= Joan |title= Los jardines de Gaud\u00ed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPM01pCm_QIC&dq=isbn:8483015382 |year=2001 |publisher=Edicions UPC |isbn=9788483015384 |page=75 |language=Spanish}}</ref> The building had a basement, a ground floor, four other floors and a garden in the back.<ref name=\"workart\">[http://www.casabatllo.es/en/history/casa-batllo/gaudi-work-art/]</ref>\n\n===Batll\u00f3 family===\n[[File:Batllo-godo-per Napoleon.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Batll\u00f3 family]]\nThe house was bought by Josep Batll\u00f3 in 1900. The design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the Batll\u00f3 family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location. It is located in the middle of [[Passeig de Gracia]], which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area. It was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves.<ref name=\"workart\"/>\n\nIn 1906 Josep Batll\u00f3 still owned the home. The Batll\u00f3 family was very well known in Barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city. Mr. Josep Batll\u00f3 I Casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city. Mr. Batll\u00f3 married Amalia Godo Belaunzaran, from the family that founded the newspaper La Vanguardia. Josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative. Both Josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit Gaud\u00ed. Josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the Batll\u00f3 family, such as Casa P\u00eda, built by the Josep Vilaseca. He chose the architect who had designed [[Park G\u00fcell]] because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan. The family lived on the Noble Floor of Casa Batll\u00f3 until the middle of the 1950s.<ref>[http://www.casabatllo.es/en/history/batllo-family/]</ref>\n\n===Renovation (1904-1906)===\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (atrium,close up), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|240px|The atrium; Gaud\u00ed convinced Batll\u00f3 to let him expand the central well of the building to let in light, instead of rebuilding.]]\nIn 1904 Josep Batll\u00f3 hired Gaud\u00ed to design his home; at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house. Gaud\u00ed convinced Josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year. The building was completed and refurbished in 1906. He completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the Batll\u00f3 family. He expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors. In the same year the Barcelona City Council selected the house as a candidate for that year's best building award. The award was given to another architect that year despite Gaud\u00ed's design.\n\n===Refurbishments===\nJosep Batll\u00f3 died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940 . After the death of the two parents, the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954. In 1954 an insurance company named Seguros Iberia acquired Casa Batll\u00f3 and set up offices there. In 1970, the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house. In 1983, the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior fa\u00e7ade was illuminated in the ceremony of [[La Merc\u00e8]].\n\n===Multiple uses===\nIn 1993, the current owners of Casa Batll\u00f3 bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building.<ref>In 1999 the elevator was reformed to adapt it to modern standards preserving its original appearance.

More than 2,500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions.

The building looks very remarkable &mdash; like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.\n\nIt seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n===Loft===\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 Parabolic Arches.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The loft, originally a service area, has sixty [[catenary arches]]]]\n\nThe loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty [[catenary arch]]es that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal.  Some people believe that the \u201cribcage\u201d design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon's spine that is represented in the roof.\n\n===Noble floor and museum===\n[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (interior), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Interior of the Noble Floor, which currently houses a museum open to the public]]\nThe noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes. On the noble floor, there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Mr. Batll\u00f3's study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like d\u00e9cor continues throughout the whole noble floor.\n\nIn 2002, the house opened its doors to the public, and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. The building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaud\u00ed. Casa Batll\u00f3 met with very much unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batll\u00f3, the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well. In 2005, Casa Batll\u00f3 became a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://www.worldsiteguides.com/europe/spain/barcelona/casa-batllo/]</ref>\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:Jfader batto roof.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Four chimney stacks on the roof, with the dragon's spine roof arch behind]]\nThe roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design. Gaud\u00ed represents an animal's spine by using tiles of different colors on one side. The roof is decorated with four chimney stacks, that are designed to prevent backdraughts.<ref>[http://www.casabatllo.es/en/history/the-building/]</ref>\n\n===Exterior fa\u00e7ade===\n[[File:CasaBatllo 0170.JPG|thumb|left|150px|The fa\u00e7ade has three distinct sections.]]\nThe fa\u00e7ade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated.

The building looks very remarkable &mdash; like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.\n\nIt seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 8}, {"title": "Loft", "paragraphs": "[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 Parabolic Arches.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The loft, originally a service area, has sixty [[catenary arches]]]]\n\nThe loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty [[catenary arch]]es that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal.  Some people believe that the \u201cribcage\u201d design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon's spine that is represented in the roof.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": "Noble floor and museum", "paragraphs": "[[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (interior), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Interior of the Noble Floor, which currently houses a museum open to the public]]\nThe noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes. On the noble floor, there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Mr. Batll\u00f3's study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like d\u00e9cor continues throughout the whole noble floor.\n\nIn 2002, the house opened its doors to the public, and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. The building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaud\u00ed. Casa Batll\u00f3 met with very much unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batll\u00f3, the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well.
