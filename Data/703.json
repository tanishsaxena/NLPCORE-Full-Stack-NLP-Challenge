This can be seen in the use of [[carrot]]s and [[tomato]]es.  Cuisine in China makes frequent use of Asian [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[bok choy]] and [[kai-lan]] and puts a greater emphasis on fresh [[meat]] and [[seafood]].<ref name = \"Oxford\">{{cite book   | title = The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink | author= Andrew F.

The food also has a reputation for high levels of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] to enhance the flavor. Market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer \"MSG Free\" or \"No MSG\" menus, or to omit this ingredient on request.<ref name = \"Oxford\"/>\n\n[[File:FriedWonton.jpg|thumb|Carryout Chinese food is commonly served in a paper carton with a wire bail, known as an [[oyster pail]].]]\nAmerican Chinese cuisine makes use of ingredients not native to and very rarely used in China. One such example is the common use of Western [[broccoli]] ({{zh|t=\u897f\u862d|p=x\u012bl\u00e1n}}) instead of Chinese broccoli ([[Gai-lan]], {{zh|t=\u82a5\u862d|p=ji\u00e8l\u00e1n|labels=no}}) in American Chinese cuisine. Occasionally, Western broccoli is also referred to as ''{{lang|yue|{{tonesup|sai1 laan4 fa1}}}}'' in Cantonese ({{zh|t=\u897f\u862d\u82b1|labels=no}}) in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli. Among Chinese speakers, however, it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified.\n\nThis is also the case with the words for [[carrot]] (''luo buo'' or ''lo baak,'' or ''hong luo buo'', ''hong'' meaning \"red\") and [[onion]] (''yang cong''). ''Lo baak'', in [[Cantonese]], can refer to several types of rod-shaped root vegetable including carrot, [[daikon]], green radish, or an umbrella term for all of them. The orange Western carrot is known in some areas of China as \"foreign [[radish]]\" (or more properly ''hung lo baak'' in Cantonese, ''hung'' meaning \"red\"). When the word for onion, ''cong'', is used, it is understood that one is referring to \"green onions\" (otherwise known to English-speakers as \"[[scallion]]s\" or \"spring onions\"). The larger, many-layered onion [[bulb]] common in the United States is called ''yang cong''. This translates as \"foreign onion\". These names make it evident that the American broccoli, carrot, and onion are not indigenous to China, and therefore are less common in the traditional cuisines of China.\n\n[[Yeung Chow Fried Rice|Egg fried rice]] in American Chinese cuisine is also prepared differently, with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce. Some food styles, such as [[dim sum]], were also modified to fit American palates, such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce.<ref name = \"Oxford\"/>\n\n[[Salad]]s containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional Chinese cuisine, as are Japanese style [[sushi]] or [[sashimi]].  However, an increasing number of American Chinese restaurants, including some upscale establishments, have started to offer these items in response to customer demand.\n\n[[Ming Tsai]], the owner of the Blue Ginger restaurant in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], and host of [[PBS]] culinary show ''[[Simply Ming]]'', said that American Chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing 3-5 regions of China at one time, have [[chop suey]], or have \"fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce\", \"eight different sweet and sour dishes\", or \"a whole page of 20 different chow meins or fried rice dishes\". Tsai said \"Chinese-American cuisine is 'dumbed-down' Chinese food. It's adapted... to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public\".<ref>\"[https://cnneatocracy.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/chef-ming-tsai-wants-you-to-have-a-chinese-friend/ Chef Ming Tsai wants you to have a Chinese friend]\". [[CNN]]. January 19, 2011. Retrieved on January 19, 2011.</ref>\n\nMost American Chinese establishments cater to non-Chinese customers with menus written in English or containing pictures. If separate Chinese-language menus are available, they typically feature items such as [[liver (food)|liver]], [[chicken feet]], or other meat dishes that might deter American customers.  In [[Chinatown, Manhattan]],<!-- intentional link to DAB page, discuss before changing --> the restaurants were known for having a \"phantom\" menu with food preferred by ethnic Chinese, but believed to be disliked by non-Chinese Americans.<ref>{{cite web|author=5:46 pm |url=http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/02/anthony_bourdain_plays_it_safe.html |title=Anthony Bourdain Plays It Safe at Hop Kee, Shuns \u2018Phantom Menu\u2019 - Grub Street New York |publisher=Newyork.grubstreet.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n[[Image:Chopsueywithrice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chop suey, made with garlic chicken and peapods, on [[fried rice]]]]\n[[File:Fortune cookie.jpg|200px|thumb|An unopened fortune cookie]]\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "multiple issues", "values": [{"name": "section", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "1", "value": "{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\n{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}"}]}, {"name": "refimprove section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2016"}]}, {"name": "Original research section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2016"}]}, {"name": "sfnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hom"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1997"}]}, {"name": "sfnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Hayford"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2011"}, {"name": "p", "value": "11-12"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Complete Asian Cookbook"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Charmaine"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Solomon"}, {"name": "page", "value": "281"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=Mdfacqx2UaQC&pg=PA368"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780804837576"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 15, 2006"}]}, {"name": "cite news", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Parkinson"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Rhonda"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Regional Chinese Cuisine"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://chinesefood.about.com/od/regionalchinesecuisine/ss/cookingstyles.htm"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "July 8, 2014"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "About.com"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070217160414/http://chinesefood.about.com/od/regionalchinesecuisine/ss/cookingstyles.htm"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "2007-02-17"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "cite book   ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Andrew F.

Yellow-hair chicken is valued for its flavor, but needs to be cooked properly to be tender due to its lower fat and higher muscle content. This dish usually does not appear on the English-language menu.\n\n[[Dau Miu]] ({{zh|c=\u8c46\u82d7|p=d\u00f2umi\u00e1o|labels=no}}) is a Chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early 1990s, and now not only appears on English-language menus, usually as \"pea shoots\", but is often served by upscale non-Asian restaurants as well. Originally it was only available during a few months of the year, but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year-round.\n\n===North American versions found in China===\n[[File:Egg foo young.JPG|thumb|Egg foo young]]\n[[File:Beef with broccoli.JPG|thumb|Beef with broccoli]]\n* [[Cashew chicken]] \u2013 Stir fried tender chicken pieces with cashews.\n* [[Chow mein]] \u2013 literally means \"stir-fried [[noodle]]s\". Chow mein consists of fried crispy noodles with bits of meat and vegetables. It can come with chicken, pork, shrimp or beef.\n* [[Egg foo young]] \u2013 a Chinese-style omelet with vegetables and meat, usually served with a brown gravy. While some restaurants in North America deep-fry the omelet, versions found in Asia are more likely to fry in the wok.\n* [[Egg roll]] \u2013 while [[spring roll]]s have a thin, light beige crispy skin that flakes apart, and is filled with mushrooms, [[bamboo]], and other vegetables inside, the American-style egg roll has a thicker, chewier, dark brown bubbly skin stuffed with cabbage and usually bits of meat or seafood (such as pork or shrimp), but no egg.\n* [[Fried rice]] \u2013 fried rice dishes are popular offerings in American Chinese food due to the speed and ease of preparation and their appeal to American tastes. Fried rice is generally prepared with rice cooled overnight, allowing restaurants to put leftover rice to good use (freshly cooked rice is actually less suitable for fried rice). The Chinese American version of this dish typically uses more soy sauce than the versions found in China. Fried rice is offered with different combinations of meat (pork, chicken and shrimp are the most popular) and vegetables.\n* [[Ginger beef]] \u2013 ({{zh|t=\u751f\u8591\u725b\u8089|p=sh\u0113ngji\u0101ng ni\u00far\u00f2u|labels=no}}) Tender beef cut in chunks, mixed with ginger and Chinese mixed vegetables.\n* [[Ginger fried beef]] \u2013 ({{zh|t=\u4e7e\u7092\u725b\u8089\u7d72|p=g\u0101nch\u01ceo ni\u00far\u00f2u-s\u012b|labels=no}}) Tender beef cut in strings, battered, deep dried, then re-fried in a wok mixed with a sweet sauce, a variation of a popular Northern Chinese dish.\n* [[Hulatang]] \u2013 a Chinese traditional soup with hot spices, often called \"spicy soup\" on menus\n* [[Kung Pao chicken]] \u2013 The [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]] dish is spicy hot, but the versions served in North America tend to be less so if at all, and sometimes leave out the [[Sichuan pepper]] that is a fundamental part of the original dish. \n* [[Lo mein]] (\"stirred noodles\"). These noodles are frequently made with eggs and flour, making them chewier than simply using water. Thick, spaghetti shaped noodles are pan fried with vegetables (mainly bok choy and Chinese cabbage ([[Napa cabbage|napa]])) and meat. Sometimes this dish is referred to as \"chow mein\" (which literally means \"stir-fried noodles\" in Cantonese).\n* [[Mei Fun]] (see [[Rice vermicelli]] dishes)\n* [[Moo shu pork]] \u2013 The original version uses more typically Chinese ingredients (including [[Cloud ear fungus|wood ear]] fungi and [[daylily]] buds) and thin flour pancakes while the American version uses vegetables more familiar to Americans, and thicker pancakes. This dish is quite popular in Chinese restaurants in the United States, but not so popular in China.\n* [[Orange chicken]] \u2013 chopped, battered, fried chicken with a sweet orange flavored chili sauce that is thickened and glazed. The traditional version consists of stir-fried chicken in a light, slightly sweet soy sauce that is flavored with dried orange peels.\n* [[Wonton soup]] \u2013 In most American Chinese restaurants, only wonton dumplings in broth are served, while versions found in China may come with noodles. In Canton, Wonton Soup can be a full meal in itself, consisting of thin egg noodles and several pork and prawn wontons in a pork or chicken soup broth or noodle broth. Especially in takeout restaurants, wonton are often made with thicker dough skins.\n* [[Beijing beef]] \u2013 In China, this dish uses ''[[gai lan]]'' (Chinese broccoli) rather than American [[broccoli]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Jung"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "p", "value": "[https://books.google.com/books?id=P99LCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=almond%20chicken&f=false 197 etc.]"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/16fort.html?_r=1"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The New York Times]]"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Solving a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery Inside a Cookie"}, {"name": "date", "value": "January 16, 2008"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "New University"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.newuniversity.org/2008/06/features/history_and_culture_chinese156/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "History and Culture: Chinese Food"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "New University"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2018-04-16"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.canyoustayfordinner.com/2010/06/30/beef-and-broccoli/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Beef and Broccoli &#124; Can You Stay For Dinner?"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Canyoustayfordinner.com"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2018-04-16"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://chinese.food.com/recipe/the-best-easy-beef-and-broccoli-stir-fry-99476"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120910210447/http://chinese.food.com/recipe/the-best-easy-beef-and-broccoli-stir-fry-99476"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Best Easy Beef And Broccoli Stir-Fry Recipe - Food.com - 99476<!-- Bot generated title -->"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "September 10, 2012"}]}, {"name": "zh", "values": [{"name": "t", "value": "\u9ec3\u6bdb\u96de"}, {"name": "j", "value": "wong4 mou4 gai1"}, {"name": "p", "value": "hu\u00e1ngm\u00e1o j\u012b"}, {"name": "l", "value": "yellow-feather chicken"}, {"name": "links", "value": "no"}]}, {"name": "zh", "values": [{"name": "c", "value": "\u8c46\u82d7"}, {"name": "p", "value": "d\u00f2umi\u00e1o"}, {"name": "labels", "value": "no"}]}, {"name": "zh", "values": [{"name": "t", "value": "\u751f\u8591\u725b\u8089"}, {"name": "p", "value": "sh\u0113ngji\u0101ng ni\u00far\u00f2u"}, {"name": "labels", "value": "no"}]}, {"name": "zh", "values": [{"name": "t", "value": "\u4e7e\u7092\u725b\u8089\u7d72"}, {"name": "p", "value": "g\u0101nch\u01ceo ni\u00far\u00f2u-s\u012b"}, {"name": "labels", "value": "no"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "American Chinese restaurant menu items", "paragraphs": "Dishes that often appear on American Chinese restaurant menus include:\n* [[Almond chicken]] - chicken breaded in batter containing ground almonds, fried and served with almonds and onions.{{sfnb|Jung|2010| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=P99LCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=almond%20chicken&f=false 197 etc.]}}\n* [[General Tso's chicken]] \u2013 chunks of chicken that are dipped in a batter, deep-fried, and seasoned with ginger, garlic, sesame oil, scallions, and hot [[chili pepper]]s.

The trademark dishes of American Chinese cuisine remain on the menu, but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables, and the selection is vegetarian-friendly. This new cuisine has exotic ingredients like [[mango]]s and [[portobello mushroom]]s. [[Brown rice]] is often offered as an alternative to [[white rice]]. Some restaurants substitute grilled wheat flour [[tortilla]]s for the rice pancakes in [[mu shu]] dishes. This occurs even in some restaurants that would not otherwise be identified as California Chinese, both the more Westernized places and the more authentic places. There is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] bakery that sells some restaurants thinner tortillas made for use with mu shu. Mu shu purists do not always react positively to this trend.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Mu Shu Tortilla Flats: Chinese restaurant needs better mu shu wraps |date= February 27, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007080309/http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b6c82e1ca42c0c4a952c682acd5b192 |archivedate=October 7, 2007 |work=AsianWeek |quote=Everything was well and good with one huge exception: The mu shu wrappers were flour tortillas!|url=http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b6c82e1ca42c0c4a952c682acd5b192 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, many restaurants serving more native-style Chinese cuisines exist, due to the high numbers and proportion of ethnic Chinese in the San Francisco Bay Area. Restaurants specializing in Cantonese, Sichuanese, Hunanese, Northern Chinese, Shanghainese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong traditions are widely available, as are more specialized restaurants such as seafood restaurants, [[Hong Kong-style Western cuisine|Hong Kong-style diners and cafes]], also known as ''[[Cha chaan teng]]'' ({{zh|t=\u8336\u9910\u5ef3|p=ch\u00e1c\u0101nt\u012bng|labels=no}}), [[dim sum]] teahouses, and [[hot pot]] restaurants. Many Chinatown areas also feature [[Chinese bakery products|Chinese bakeries]], [[boba milk tea]] shops, [[siu mei|roasted meat]], [[Chinese Buddhist cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], and specialized dessert shops. [[Chop suey]] is not widely available in [[San Francisco]], and the area's chow mein is different from [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] chow mein.\n\n===Boston===\nChinese cuisine in [[Boston]] reflects a [[m\u00e9lange]] of multiple influential factors. The growing [[Chinatown, Boston|Boston Chinatown]] accommodates [[Chinatown bus lines|Chinese-owned bus lines]] shuttling an increasing number of passengers to and from the numerous [[Chinese Americans in New York City|Chinatowns in New York City]], and this has led to some commonalities in the local Chinese cuisine derived from Chinese food in New York. A large immigrant [[Fujianese people|Fujianese]] immigrant population has made a home in Boston, leading to [[Fuzhou cuisine]] being readily available in Boston. An increasing [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] population has also been exerting an influence on Chinese cuisine in [[Greater Boston]]. Finally, innovative dishes incorporating chow mein and chop suey as well as [[farm-to-table|locally farmed]] produce and regionally procured [[seafood]] ingredients are found in Chinese as well as non-Chinese food in and around Boston.\n\n[[Joyce Chen (chef)|Joyce Chen]] introduced northern Chinese (Mandarin) and Shanghainese dishes to Boston in the 1950s, including [[Peking duck]], [[moo shu pork]], [[hot and sour soup]], and [[potstickers]], which she called \"Peking Ravioli\" or \"Ravs\".<ref name=Mennies>{{cite web|last1=Mennies|first1=Leah|title=The Story of Peking Ravioli|url=http://luckypeach.com/the-story-of-peking-ravioli|website=Lucky Peach|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317230442/http://luckypeach.com/the-story-of-peking-ravioli/|archive-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref> Her restaurants would be frequented by early workers on the [[ARPANET]],<ref>[[Katie Hafner|Hafner, K.]], & Lyon, M.

Also like Boston, the emerging [[Vietnamese cuisine]] scene in Philadelphia is contributing to the milieu of Chinese cuisine.\n\n===Hawaii===\nHawaiian-Chinese food developed somewhat differently from Chinese cuisine in the [[continental United States]]. Owing to the diversity of [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] ethnicities in Hawaii and the history of the [[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|Chinese influence in Hawaii]], resident Chinese cuisine forms a component of the [[cuisine of Hawaii]], which is a [[fusion cuisine|fusion]] of different culinary traditions. Some Chinese dishes are typically served as part of [[plate lunch]]es in Hawaii. The names of foods are different as well, such as ''[[Manapua]]'', from the Hawaiian contraction of \"Mea ono pua'a\" or \"delicious [[pork]] item\" from the dim sum ''bao'', though the meat is not necessarily pork.\n\n===Other regional American Chinese dishes===\n* [[Chow mein sandwich]] \u2013 sandwich of chow mein and gravy ([[Southeastern Massachusetts]]; [[Rhode Island]])\n* [[Chop suey sandwich]] \u2013 sandwich of chicken chop suey on a hamburger bun ([[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]] of [[Massachusetts]])\n* [[St. Paul sandwich]] \u2013 [[egg foo young]] patty in plain
