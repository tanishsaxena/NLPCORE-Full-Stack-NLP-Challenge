Extreme shortening <!-- why shortening? --> caused by the event resulted in marine [[sedimentary rock]]s rising by [[thrust fault|thrusting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] into high mountain peaks such as [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]]. Mont Blanc spans the French\u2013Italian border, and at {{convert|4810|m|abbr=on|0}} is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|{{convert|4000|m|ft}}]].\n\nThe altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as [[ibex]] live in the higher peaks to elevations of {{convert|3400|m|abbr=on|0}}, and plants such as [[Edelweiss]] grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] era. A [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman|mummified man]], determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian\u2013Italian border in 1991.\n\nBy the 6th century BC, the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] was well established. [[Hannibal]] famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had settlements in the region. In 1800, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], followed by the [[golden age of alpinism]] as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks.\n\nThe Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages, although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps. At present, the region is home to 14 million people and has 120&nbsp;million annual visitors.<ref name = \"Chatr\u00e98\">Chatr\u00e9, Baptiste, et al.

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the [[polar region]]s have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=737}} The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.<ref>Fleming (2000), 3</ref>\n\n[[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|The [[Aletsch Glacier]] with pine trees growing on the hillside (2007; the surface is {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} lower than 150 years ago)]]\n\nThe severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal [[foehn wind]].

At altitudes between {{convert|1000|and|3,000|m|abbr=on|}}, snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. [[Snow line]]s vary from {{convert|2400|to|3,000|m|abbr=on|}}, above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even during July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.<ref>Ceben (1998), 34\u201336</ref>\n\nThe Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=on|}}, depending on the location. The [[montane]] zone extends from {{convert|800|to|1,700|m|abbr=on|}}, followed by the sub-Alpine zone from {{convert|1600|to|2,400|m|abbr=on|}}. The Alpine zone, extending from [[tree line]] to snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.<ref>Viazzo (1980), 17</ref>\n\nVarious models of [[climate change]] have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff.<ref>Benniston (2011), 3\u20134</ref> Significant changes, of both natural and anthropogenic origins, have already been diagnosed from observations.<ref>{{Cite

Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion in relation to the proportion of the cows' milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages which has become somewhat mechanized in recent years, although the slopes are so steep that usually scythes are necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/> Alpine festivals vary from country to country and often include the display of local costumes such as [[dirndl]] and [[tracht]]en, the playing of [[Alpenhorn]]s, wrestling matches, some pagan traditions such as [[Walpurgis Night]] and, in many areas, [[Carnival]] is celebrated before [[Lent]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 129, 135</ref>\n\nIn the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the ''stube'', the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss [[chalet]] originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill, and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/><ref>Shoumataff (2001), 134</ref>\n[[File:Schaufschod 2009 05.JPG|thumb|Herding sheep in Austria]]\n\nFood is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as [[fondue]], where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served in a traditional manner on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.\n[[File:Toit de Lauzes.jpg|thumb|left|Alpine chalet being built in Haute-Maurienne (Savoy), the use of thick pieces of [[orthogneiss]] (4\u20137&nbsp;cm) is in accordance with the strict architural regulations in the region bordering the national parks of Vanoise-Grand Paradis.]]\nRoofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of [[schist]], gneiss or [[slate]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 131, 134</ref> Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the [[Maurienne]] valley in [[Savoy]], where the amount of snow during the cold months is important.
