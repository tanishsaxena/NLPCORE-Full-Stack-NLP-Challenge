Alfred Vogt found these moves difficult, later remarking:\n\n{{quote|Childhood was a terrible period for me. I was like a ship without anchor being swept along through darkness in a storm.

During his teen years, Alfred worked as a farmhand and a truck driver, and by the age of 19, he was working in [[Ottawa]] for the Canadian census bureau.  He began his writing career with stories in the [[True Confessions (magazine)|true confession]] style of [[pulp magazines]] such as ''[[True Story (magazine)|True Story]]''.  Most of these stories were published anonymously, with the first-person narratives allegedly being written by people (often women) in extraordinary, emotional, and life-changing circumstances.\n\nAfter a year in Ottawa, he moved back to Winnipeg, where he sold newspaper advertising space and continued to write.  While continuing to pen melodramatic \"true confessions\" stories through 1937, he also began writing short radio dramas for local radio station CKY, as well as conducting interviews published in trade magazines.  He added the middle name \"Elton\" at some point in the mid-1930s, and at least one confessional story (1937's \"To Be His Keeper\") was sold to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', who misspelled his name \"Alfred Alton Bogt\" in the byline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/stories/keeper.php#top|title=To Be His Keeper by A.

[[John W. Campbell]]'s novelette \"[[Who Goes There?]]\" (later adapted into ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' and ''[[The Thing (1982)|The Thing]]'') inspired van Vogt to write \"[[Vault of the Beast]]\", which he submitted to that same magazine. Campbell, who edited ''Astounding'' (and had written the story under a pseudonym), sent van Vogt a rejection letter, but one which encouraged van Vogt to try again. Van Vogt sent another story, entitled \"[[Black Destroyer]]\", which was accepted. A revised version of \"Vault of the Beast\" would be published in 1940.\n[[File:Fantasy book 1947 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Van Vogt's \"Ship of Darkness\" was the cover story in the second issue of ''Fantasy Book'' in 1948.]]\n\nVan Vogt's first SF publication was inspired by ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>Drake, H.

Hull, who had previously worked as a private secretary, would act as van Vogt's typist, and be credited with writing several SF stories of her own throughout the early 1940s.\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 caused a change in van Vogt's circumstances.  Ineligible for military service due to his poor eyesight, he accepted a clerking job with the Canadian Department of National Defence.  This necessitated a move back to [[Ottawa]], where he and his wife would stay for the next year and a half.\n\nMeanwhile, his writing career continued.  \"Discord in Scarlet\" was van Vogt's second story to be published, also appearing as the cover story.<ref>[http://www.icshi.net/worlds/voyageof.htm \"The Voyage of the Space Beagle\"] (cover images for numerous editions and adaptations of \"The Black Destroyer\" and its series).

(London: Savoy Books, 1980); ''Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction'' (Berkeley Books, 1980).</ref>\n\nVan Vogt was also always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern [[meta-systems]])\u2014the characters in his very first story used a system called \"Nexialism\" to analyze the alien's behavior. Around this time, he became particularly interested in the [[general semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]].\n\nHe subsequently wrote a novel merging these overarching themes, ''[[The World of \u0100]]'', originally serialized in ''Astounding'' in 1945. \u0100 (often rendered as ''Null-A''), or [[non-Aristotelian logic]], refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], [[inductive reasoning]] (compare [[fuzzy logic]]), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, [[deductive reasoning]].  The novel recounts the adventures of an individual living in an apparent [[Utopia]], where those with superior brainpower make up the ruling class... though all is not as it seems.  A sequel, ''The Players of \u0100'' (later re-titled ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]'') was serialized in 1948\u201349.\n\nAt the same time, in his fiction, van Vogt was consistently sympathetic to [[absolute monarchy]] as a form of government.<ref name=\"DK\">{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Knight|date=1967|title=In Search of Wonder|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}</ref> This was the case, for instance, in the ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher|Weapon Shop]]'' series, the ''[[The Mixed Men|Mixed Men]]'' series, and in single stories such as \"Heir Apparent\" (1945), whose protagonist was described as a \"[[benevolent dictator]]\".  These sympathies were the subject of much critical discussion during van Vogt's career, and afterwards.\n\nVan Vogt published \"Enchanted Village\" in the July 1950 issue of ''Other Worlds Science Stories''. It was reprinted in over 20 collections or anthologies, and appeared many times in translation.<ref>http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?56655 Retrieved 10 March 2017</ref>\n\n===Dianetics and fix-ups (1950\u20131961)===\nIn 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Dianetics]] operation in California.  Van Vogt had first met Hubbard in 1945, and became interested in his [[Dianetics]] theories, which were published shortly thereafter.  Dianetics was the secular precursor to Hubbard's Church of [[Scientology]]; van Vogt would have no association with Scientology, as he did not approve of its mysticism.\n\nThe California Dianetics operation went broke nine months later, but never went bankrupt, due to van Vogt's arrangements with creditors. Very shortly after that, van Vogt and his wife opened their own Dianetics center, partly financed by his writings, until he \"signed off\" around 1961.  In practical terms, what this meant was that from 1951 through 1961, van Vogt's focus was on Dianetics, and no new story ideas flowed from his typewriter.\n\n===Fix-ups===\nHowever, during the 1950s, van Vogt retrospectively patched together many of his previously published stories into novels, sometimes creating new interstitial material to help bridge gaps in the narrative.  Van Vogt referred to the resulting books as \"[[fix-up]]s\", a term that entered the vocabulary of science-fiction criticism. When the original stories were closely related this was often successful \u2014 although some van Vogt fix-ups featured disparate stories thrown together that bore little relation to each other, generally making for a less coherent plot.  One of his best-known (and well-regarded) novels, ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' (1950) was a fix-up of four short stories including \"Discord in Scarlet\"; it was published in at least five European languages by 1955.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\nAlthough Van Vogt averaged a new book title every ten months from 1951 to 1961, none of them were new stories. All of van Vogt's books from 1951 to 1961 were fix-ups, or collections of previously published stories, or expansions of previously published short stories to novel length, or republications of his books under new titles.  All were based on story material written and originally published between 1939 and 1950.  As well, one non-fiction work, ''The Hypnotism Handbook'', appeared in 1956, though it had apparently been written much earlier.\n\nSome of van Vogt's more well-known work was still produced using the fix-up method. In 1951, he published the fix-up ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]].'' In the same decade, van Vogt also produced collections and  [[fixup]]s such as ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' (1952), ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' (1959), and the two \"Clane\" novels, ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]'' (1962), which were inspired (like [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]]) by [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial history]], specifically the reign of [[Claudius]].\n\nAfter more than a decade of running their Dianetics center, Hull and van Vogt closed it in 1961.  Nevertheless, van Vogt maintained his association with the overall organization and was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors into the 1980s.<ref name=platt/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Knight"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Damon"}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Damon Knight"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1967"}, {"name": "title", "value": "In Search of Wonder"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Chicago"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Advent"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Dianetics and fix-ups (1950\u20131961)", "paragraphs": "In 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of [[L.

In practical terms, what this meant was that from 1951 through 1961, van Vogt's focus was on Dianetics, and no new story ideas flowed from his typewriter.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5}, {"title": "Fix-ups", "paragraphs": "However, during the 1950s, van Vogt retrospectively patched together many of his previously published stories into novels, sometimes creating new interstitial material to help bridge gaps in the narrative.  Van Vogt referred to the resulting books as \"[[fix-up]]s\", a term that entered the vocabulary of science-fiction criticism. When the original stories were closely related this was often successful \u2014 although some van Vogt fix-ups featured disparate stories thrown together that bore little relation to each other, generally making for a less coherent plot.  One of his best-known (and well-regarded) novels, ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' (1950) was a fix-up of four short stories including \"Discord in Scarlet\"; it was published in at least five European languages by 1955.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\nAlthough Van Vogt averaged a new book title every ten months from 1951 to 1961, none of them were new stories. All of van Vogt's books from 1951 to 1961 were fix-ups, or collections of previously published stories, or expansions of previously published short stories to novel length, or republications of his books under new titles.  All were based on story material written and originally published between 1939 and 1950.  As well, one non-fiction work, ''The Hypnotism Handbook'', appeared in 1956, though it had apparently been written much earlier.\n\nSome of van Vogt's more well-known work was still produced using the fix-up method. In 1951, he published the fix-up ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]].'' In the same decade, van Vogt also produced collections and  [[fixup]]s such as ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' (1952), ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' (1959), and the two \"Clane\" novels, ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]'' (1962), which were inspired (like [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]]) by [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial history]], specifically the reign of [[Claudius]].\n\nAfter more than a decade of running their Dianetics center, Hull and van Vogt closed it in 1961.  Nevertheless, van Vogt maintained his association with the overall organization and was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors into the 1980s.<ref name=platt/>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 6}, {"title": "Return to writing and later career (1962\u20131986)", "paragraphs": "Though the constant re-packaging of his older work meant that he had never really been away from the book publishing world, van Vogt had not published any wholly new fiction for almost 12 years when he decided to return to writing in 1962.  He did not return immediately to science fiction, however, but instead wrote the only mainstream, non-sf novel of his career.\n \nVan Vogt was profoundly affected by revelations of [[totalitarian]] [[police state]]s that emerged after [[World War II]]. Accordingly, he wrote a mainstream novel that he set in [[Communist China (modern)|Communist China]], ''The Violent Man'' (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of \"the violent male type\", which he described as a \"man who had to be right\", a man who \"instantly attracts women\" and who he said were the men who \"run the world\".<ref name=\"HLDrake\" />  Contemporary reviews were lukewarm at best,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/aa-van-vogt/the-violent-man/|title=THE VIOLENT MAN by A.A. Van Vogt|publisher=|via=www.kirkusreviews.com}}</ref> and van Vogt thereafter returned to science fiction.\n\nFrom 1963 through the mid-1980s, van Vogt once again published new material on a regular basis, though fix-ups and reworked material also appeared relatively often.  His later novels included fix-ups such as ''The Beast'' (also known as ''Moonbeast'') (1963), ''[[Rogue Ship]]'' (1965), ''[[Quest for the Future]]'' (1970) and ''[[Supermind (novel)|Supermind]]'' (1977).  He also wrote novels by expanding previously published short stories; works of this type include ''The Darkness on Diamondia'' (1972) and ''Future Glitter'' (also known as ''Tyranopolis''; 1973).\n\nNovels that were written simply as novels, and not serialized magazine pieces or fix-ups, were very rare in van Vogt's oeuvre, but began to appear regularly beginning in the 1970s.  Van Vogt's original novels included ''[[Children of Tomorrow]]'' (1970), ''The Battle of Forever'' (1971) and ''The Anarchistic Colossus'' (1977).  Over the years, many sequels to his classic works were promised, but only one appeared:  ''[[Null-A Three]]'' (1984; originally published in French). Several later books were originally published in Europe, and at least one novel only ever appeared in foreign language editions and was never published in its original English.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/aa-van-vogt/the-violent-man/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "THE VIOLENT MAN by A.A.

Knight described ''The World of Null-A'' as \"one of the worst allegedly adult science fiction stories ever published\". Concerning van Vogt's writing, Knight said:\n\n{{quote|In general van Vogt seems to me to fail consistently as a writer in these elementary ways: 1. His plots do not bear examination. 2. His choice of words and his sentence-structure are fumbling and insensitive. 3.

He noted that van Vogt's stories almost invariably present [[absolute monarchy]] in a favorable light. In 1974, Knight retracted some of his criticism after finding out about Vogt's writing down his dreams as a part of his working methods:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/3/notes3.htm|title=Notes, Reports, and Correspondence: Spring 1974|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|This explains a good deal about the stories, and suggests that it is really useless to attack them by conventional standards.
