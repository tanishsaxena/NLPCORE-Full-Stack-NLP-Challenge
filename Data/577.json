Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an \"education direct from nature.\" Amp\u00e8re's father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as [[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon|Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon]]'s ''Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et particuli\u00e8re'' (begun in 1749) and [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became Amp\u00e8re's schoolmasters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The young Amp\u00e8re, however, soon resumed his [[Latin]] lessons, which enabled him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amp\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Marie|volume=1|pages=878\u2013879}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Andre-Marie_Ampere"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Andre-Marie Ampere"}, {"name": "work", "value": "IEEE Global History Network"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "IEEE"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "21 July 2011"}]}, {"name": "Citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2017"}]}, {"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Amp\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Marie"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "878\u2013879"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "French Revolution", "paragraphs": "In addition, Amp\u00e8re used his access to the latest books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age 12.

The [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399) that began during his youth was also influential: Amp\u00e8re's father was called into [[Civil service|public service]] by the new revolutionary government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://simplyknowledge.com/popular/biography/andre-marie-ampere |title=Biography of Andre Marie Ampere|accessdate=2019-09-03}}</ref> becoming a justice of the peace in a small town near Lyon. When the [[Jacobin]] faction seized control of the Revolutionary government in 1792, his father Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re resisted the new political tides, and he was [[guillotine]]d on 24 November 1793, as part of the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin purges]] of the period.\n\nIn 1796 Amp\u00e8re met Julie Carron, and in 1799 they were married. Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re took his first regular job in 1799 as a [[mathematics]] teacher, which gave him the financial security to marry Carron and father his first child, [[Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re|Jean-Jacques]] (named after his father), the next year. (Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re eventually achieved his own fame as a scholar of languages.) Amp\u00e8re's maturation corresponded with the transition to the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic regime]] in France, and the young father and teacher found new opportunities for success within the technocratic structures favoured by the new French [[Napoleon|First Consul]]. In 1802 Amp\u00e8re was appointed a professor of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] at the \u00c9cole Centrale in [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], leaving his ailing wife and infant son [[Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re|Jean-Jacques Antoine Amp\u00e8re]] in Lyon.

Despite his lack of formal qualifications, Amp\u00e8re was appointed a professor of mathematics at the school in 1809. As well as holding positions at this school until 1828, in 1819 and 1820 Amp\u00e8re offered courses in [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]], respectively, at the [[University of Paris]], and in 1824 he was elected to the prestigious chair in [[experimental physics]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]. In 1814 Amp\u00e8re was invited to join the class of mathematicians in the new ''Institut Imp\u00e9rial'', the umbrella under which the reformed state Academy of Sciences would sit.\n\nAmp\u00e8re engaged in a diverse array of scientific inquiries during the years leading up to his election to the academy\u2014writing papers and engaging in topics from mathematics and philosophy to chemistry and astronomy, which was customary among the leading scientific intellectuals of the day.

On the day of his wife's death he wrote two verses from the [[Psalm]]s, and the prayer, 'O Lord, God of Mercy, unite me in Heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth.'

Amp\u00e8re began developing a mathematical and physical theory to understand the relationship between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. Furthering \u00d8rsted's experimental work, Amp\u00e8re showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions, respectively - this laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He also applied mathematics in generalizing physical laws from these experimental results. The most important of these was the principle that came to be called [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's law]], which states that the mutual action of two lengths of current-carrying wire is proportional to their lengths and to the intensities of their currents. Amp\u00e8re also applied this same principle to magnetism, showing the harmony between his law and French physicist [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]]'s law of magnetic action. Amp\u00e8re's devotion to, and skill with, experimental techniques anchored his science within the emerging fields of experimental physics.\n\nAmp\u00e8re also provided a physical understanding of the electromagnetic relationship, theorizing the existence of an \"electrodynamic molecule\" (the forerunner of the idea of the [[electron]]) that served as the component element of both electricity and magnetism. Using this physical explanation of electromagnetic motion, Amp\u00e8re developed a physical account of electromagnetic phenomena that was both empirically demonstrable and mathematically predictive. In 1827 Amp\u00e8re published his magnum opus, ''M\u00e9moire sur la th\u00e9orie math\u00e9matique des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes \u00e9lectrodynamiques uniquement d\u00e9duite de l\u2019experience'' (Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience), the work that coined the name of his new science, ''electrodynamics'', and became known ever after as its founding treatise.\n\nIn 1827 Amp\u00e8re was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] and in 1828, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27ampere%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27ampere%27%29"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Library and Archive Catalogue"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Royal Society"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "13 March 2012"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": " Honours ", "paragraphs": "* '''8.10.1825''': Member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].<ref>Index biographique des membres et associ\u00e9s de l'Acad\u00e9mie royale de Belgique (1769\u20132005) p. 15</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nIn recognition of his contribution to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 [[International Exposition of Electricity]], established the [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]] as a standard unit of electrical measurement, along with the [[coulomb]], [[volt]], [[ohm]], and [[watt]], which are named, respectively, after Amp\u00e8re's contemporaries [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] of France, [[Alessandro Volta]] of [[Italy]], [[Georg Ohm]] of [[Germany]], and [[James Watt]] of [[Scotland]].
