Allegory (in the sense of the practice and use of allegorical devices and works) has occurred widely throughout history in all forms of [[art]], largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.\n\nWriters or speakers typically use allegories as [[literary device]]s or as [[rhetoric]]al devices that convey (semi-)hidden or complex meanings through [[symbol]]ic figures, actions, imagery, or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html |title=A |work=Literary Terms and Definitions |publisher=Carson-Newman University |last=Wheeler |first=L.

G. P. (1949). \"On Allegory in Homer\". The Classical Journal 44 (7): 423.]</ref> The title of \"first allegorist,\" however, is usually awarded to whoever was the earliest to put forth allegorical interpretations of Homer.  This approach leads to two possible answers: Theagenes of Rhegium (whom Porphyry calls the \"first allegorist,\" Porph. Quaest. Hom. 1.240.14-241.12 Schrad.) or Pherecydes of Syros, both of whom are presumed to be active in the 6th century B.C.E., though Pherecydes is earlier and as he is often presumed to be the first writer of prose.  The debate is complex, since it demands we observe the distinction between two often conflated uses of the Greek verb \"all\u0113gore\u012bn,\" which can mean both \"to speak allegorically\" and \"to interpret allegorically.\" <ref> [Domaradzki, M. (2017). \"The Beginnings of Greek Allegoresis\". Classical World 110 (3):301] </ref> \n\nIn the case of \"interpreting allegorically,\" Theagenes appears to be our earliest example.  Presumably in response to proto-philosophical moral critiques of Homer (e.g. Xenophanes fr. 11 Diels-Kranz <ref>[H. Diels and W. Kranz. (1951). Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, vol. 1. 6th edn. Berlin: Weidmann, 126-138.]</ref>), Theagenes proposed symbolic interpretations whereby the Gods of the Iliad actually stood for physical elements.  So, Hephestus represents Fire, for instance (for which see fr. A2 in Diels-Kranz <ref>[H. Diels and W. Kranz. (1951). Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, vol. 1. 6th edn. Berlin: Weidmann, 51-52.]</ref>).  Some scholars, however, argue that Pherecydes cosmogonic writings anticipated Theagenes allegorical work, illustrated especially by his early placement of Time (Chronos) in his genealogy of the gods, which is thought to be a reinterpretation of the titan Kronos, from more traditional genealogies.\n\nIn classical literature two of the best-known allegories are [[Allegory of the Cave|the Cave]] in Plato's ''[[Republic]]'' (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa ([[Livy]] ii. 32). \n\nAmong the best-known examples of allegory, [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]], forms a part of his larger work ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]].'' In this allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall (514a\u2013b). The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows, using language to identify their world (514c\u2013515a). According to the allegory, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality, until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows. He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery, but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves (516e\u2013518a). This allegory is, on a basic level, about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding, seeks to share it as is his duty, and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough.<ref>{{cite journal|last =Elliott|first= R.

Mediaeval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the Papal Bull ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of [[Christendom]] with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: \"''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head\u2014not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ.\" This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Mediaeval Period, following the tradition and example of the Bible.\n\nIn the late 15th century, the enigmatic ''[[Hypnerotomachia]]'', with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and [[masque]]s on contemporary allegorical representation, as [[Renaissance humanism|humanist dialectic]] conveyed them.\n\nThe denial of medieval allegory as found in the 12th-century works of [[Hugh of St Victor]] and [[Edward Topsell]]'s ''Historie of Foure-footed Beastes'' (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorisation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist [[John Ray]] and the astronomer [[Galileo]] is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Peter Harrison (historian) |last=Harrison |first=Peter |title=The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-59196-1 |page=1\u201310 |chapter=Introduction |date=2001}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/6393/portrait-of-a-lady-called-elizabeth-lady-tanfield-english-school"}, {"name": "work", "value": "ArtFund.org"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Portrait of a Lady, Called Elizabeth, Lady Tanfield by Unknown Artist"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Art Fund"}]}, {"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Allegory in the Middle Ages"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "author-link", "value": "Peter Harrison (historian)"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Harrison"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Peter"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Cambridge University Press]]"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0-521-59196-1"}, {"name": "page", "value": "1\u201310"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Introduction"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2001"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Modern allegory", "paragraphs": "\nSince meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognised.

Examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], and even some works of science fiction and fantasy, such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]].\n\nThe story of the apple falling onto [[Isaac Newton]]'s head is another famous allegory. It simplified the idea of gravity by depicting a simple way it was supposedly discovered. It also made the scientific revelation well known by condensing the theory into a short tale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revised Memoir of Newton (Normalized Version)|url=http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|website=The Newton Project|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Revised Memoir of Newton (Normalized Version)"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001"}, {"name": "website", "value": "The Newton Project"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "13 March 2017"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Poetry and fiction", "paragraphs": "\n[[File:Allegory of Arithmetic - detail.JPG|thumb|Detail of [[Laurent de La Hyre]]'s ''Allegory of Arithmetic'', c. 1650]]\nIt is important to note that while allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work, not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical, and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way. According to Henry Littlefield's 1964 article, [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'',  may be readily understood as a plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters, intended to discuss the politics of the time.<ref>[Littlefield, Henry (1964). \"The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism\".

I much prefer history \u2013 true or feigned\u2013 with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.

He noted that, had that been his intention, the book would  not have ended with the Ring being destroyed but rather with an [[arms race]] in which various powers would try to obtain such a Ring for themselves. Then Tolkien went on to outline an alternative plot for \"Lord of The Rings\", as it would have been written had such an allegory been intended, and which would have made the book into a [[dystopia]]. While all this does not mean Tolkien's works may not be treated as having allegorical themes, especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities, it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings. This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.\n\nLike allegorical stories, allegorical poetry has two meanings \u2013 a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning.\n\nSome unique specimens of allegory can be found in the following works:\n*[[Edmund Spenser]] &ndash; ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'': The several knights in the poem actually stand for several virtues.\n*[[William Shakespeare]] &ndash; ''[[The Tempest]]'': a fight between good and evil on a deserted island\n*[[John Bunyan]] &ndash; ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'': The journey of the protagonists Christian and Evangelist symbolises the ascension of the soul from earth to Heaven.\n*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] &ndash; ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'': The Devil's Staff symbolises defiance of God. The characters' names, such as ''Goodman'' and ''Faith'', ironically serve as paradox in the conclusion of the story.\n*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] &ndash; ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'': The scarlet letter symbolises many things. The characters, while developed with interiority, are allegorical in that they represent ways of seeing the world. Symbolism is also prominent.\n*[[George Orwell]] &ndash; ''[[Animal Farm]]'': The pigs stand for political figures of the [[Russian Revolution]].\n*[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai]] - ''[[The Melancholy of Resistance]]'' and the film ''[[Werckmeister Harmonies]]'': It uses a circus to describe an occupying dysfunctional government.\n*[[Edgar Allan Poe]] &ndash; ''[[The Masque of the Red Death]]'': The story can be read as an allegory for humans' inability to escape death.<ref>[Roppolo, Joseph Patrick. \"Meaning and 'The Masque of the Red Death'\", collected in Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays, edited by Robert Regan.
