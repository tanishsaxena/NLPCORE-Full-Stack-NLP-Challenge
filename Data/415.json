[[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. [[Tourism]], a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in [[East Asia]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Economy of American Samoa"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2013"}]}, {"name": "more citations needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox economy\n", "values": [{"name": "country", "value": "American Samoa"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Dollarbill4.jpg"}, {"name": "width", "value": "290px"}, {"name": "currency", "value": "[[United States dollar|US dollar]] (USD)"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1 October&nbsp;\u2013 30 September"}, {"name": "organs", "value": "none"}, {"name": "gdp rank", "value": "[[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|187th]] (nominal) / [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|190th]] (PPP)"}, {"name": "gdp", "value": "$537 million (2007 est)"}, {"name": "growth", "value": "3% (2003)"}, {"name": "per capita", "value": "$7,874 (2008)"}, {"name": "sectors", "value": "NA"}, {"name": "inflation", "value": "NA"}, {"name": "poverty", "value": "NA"}, {"name": "labor", "value": "17,630 (2007)"}, {"name": "occupations", "value": "agriculture 34%, industry 33%, services 33% (1990)"}, {"name": "unemployment", "value": "23.8% (2010)"}, {"name": "industries", "value": "tuna canneries (largely dependent on foreign fishing vessels), handicrafts"}, {"name": "exports", "value": "$445.6 million (2004)"}, {"name": "export-goods", "value": "canned tuna 93% (2004)"}, {"name": "export-partners", "value": "[[Indonesia]] 70%, Australia 6.7%, Japan 6.7%, [[Samoa]] 6.7% (2002)"}, {"name": "imports", "value": "$308.8 million (2004)"}, {"name": "import-goods", "value": "materials for canneries 56%, food 8%, petroleum products 7%, machinery and parts 6% (2004)"}, {"name": "import-partners", "value": "Australia 36.6%, New Zealand 20.3%, [[South Korea]] 16.3%, [[Mauritius]] 4.9% (2002)"}, {"name": "debt", "value": "NA"}, {"name": "revenue", "value": "$121 million (37% in local revenue and 63% in US grants) (1997)"}, {"name": "expenses", "value": "$127 million (1997)"}, {"name": "aid", "value": "more than $40 million from US in financial support (1994)"}, {"name": "cianame", "value": "aq"}, {"name": "spelling", "value": "US"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Numbers", "paragraphs": "'''[[Gross domestic product|GDP]]:''' [[purchasing power parity]] \u2013 $537 million (2007 est.)\n<br>''country comparison to the world:'' 210\n\n'''GDP (official exchange rate):''' $462.2 million (2005)\n\n'''GDP \u2013 real growth rate:''' 3% (2003)\n<br>''country comparison to the world:'' 139\n\n'''GDP \u2013 per capita:''' purchasing power parity \u2013 $7,874 (2008)\n<br>''country comparison to the world:'' 120\n\n'''GDP \u2013 composition by sector:'''\n<br>''agriculture:''\nNA%\n<br>''industry:''\nNA%\n<br>''services:''\nNA% (2002)\n\n'''Labor Force:''' 17,630 (2005)\n<br>''country comparison to the world:'' 203\n\n'''Labor force \u2013 by occupation:''' government 33%, tuna canneries 34%, other 33% (1990)\n\n'''Unemployment rate:''' 23.8% (2010)\n<br>''country comparison to the world:'' 175\n\n'''Population below poverty line:'''\nNA% (2002 est.)\n\n'''Household income or consumption by percentage share:'''\n<br>''lowest 10%:''\nNA%\n<br>''highest 10%:''\nNA%\n\n'''Inflation rate (consumer prices):'''\nNA% (2003 est.)\n\n'''Budget:'''\n<br>''revenues:'' $155.4 million (37% in local revenue and 63% in US grants)\n<br>''expenditures:'' $183.6 million (FY07)\n\n'''Agriculture \u2013 products:''' bananas, coconuts, vegetables, taro, breadfruit, yams, copra, pineapples, papayas;
