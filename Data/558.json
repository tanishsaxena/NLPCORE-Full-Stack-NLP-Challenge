An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111}}</ref>\n\nThere are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.\n\nPart of Title I was found unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as it pertains to states in the case of ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' as violating the [[sovereign immunity]] rights of the several states as specified by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules.

Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.\n\nTitle II applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]]. It includes the [[Amtrak|National Railroad Passenger Corporation]] (Amtrak), along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed-route services. ADA also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport.<ref>'Wheelchair Securement in Public Transport', http://thequantumleap.com/faq/</ref>\n\nTitle II also applies to all state and local public housing, housing assistance, and housing referrals. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with enforcing this provision.\n\n==={{anchor|Title III}}Title III\u2014public accommodations (and commercial facilities)===\n{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12181|12189}}.}}\n[[File: Drano Lake accessible fishing platform signage.jpg|thumb|The ADA sets standards for construction of accessible public facilities. Shown is a sign indicating an accessible fishing platform at [[Drano Lake]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].]]\nUnder Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal [[enjoyment]] of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.\n\nUnder Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)<ref name=ada90/> found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at 28&nbsp;C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix ''A''.\n\nTitle III also has applications to existing facilities. One of the definitions of \"discrimination\" under Title III of the ADA is a \"failure to remove\" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|42|12182|b|2|A|iv}}. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether \"removing barriers\" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is \"readily achievable\", defined as \"...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense\".\n\nThe statutory definition of \"readily achievable\" calls for a [[balancing test]] between the cost of the proposed \"fix\" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be \"readily achievable\" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.\n\nThere are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the \"maximum extent feasible\" but if following the usual standards would \"threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building\" then alternative standards may be used.\n\nUnder 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is \"readily achievable\".  Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in the application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=2013 ADA Pool Lift Compliance Deadline: Has Your Business Complied? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied |work=The National Law Review |publisher=Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed, P.A. |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Service animals ====\nThe ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm |title = ADA 2010 Revised Requirements: Service Animals |date=July 12, 2011 |publisher=US Department of Justice}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers: Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, but they are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They cannot ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability cannot be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner cannot get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animals would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety, so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premises. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals, nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to relieve itself. Lastly, people that require service dogs cannot be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly, for example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities cannot be treated as \"less than\" other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.\n\n==={{anchor|Title IV}}Title IV\u2014telecommunications===\nTitle IV of the ADA amended the landmark [[Communications Act of 1934]] primarily by adding section {{UnitedStatesCode|47|225}}. This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public [[teletypewriter]] (TTY) machines and other TDD ([[Telecommunications Device for the Deaf|telecommunications devices for the deaf]]). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what was then called dual-party relay services and now are known as [[Telecommunications Relay Services]] (TRS), such as [[STS relay]]. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.\n\n==={{anchor|Title V}}Title V\u2014miscellaneous provisions===\n{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12201|12213}}.}}\n\nTitle V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in [[Section 504]].<ref name=\"Sec12187\">{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12187}}</ref> Additionally, Title V includes an anti-retaliation or coercion provision. The ''Technical Assistance Manual'' for the ADA explains this provision: \n<blockquote>\"III-3.6000 Retaliation or coercion. Individuals who exercise their rights under the ADA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights ... Any form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere.\"</blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "anchor", "values":

An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111}}</ref>\n\nThere are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.\n\nPart of Title I was found unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as it pertains to states in the case of ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' as violating the [[sovereign immunity]] rights of the several states as specified by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] or the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], who can sue on their behalf.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Disability Rights in the Supreme Court|url = http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html|website = The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date = January 27, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020201040214/http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html|archive-date = February 1, 2002|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "anchor", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Title I"}]}, {"name": "UnitedStatesCode", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "42"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12111"}, {"name": "3", "value": "12117"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://finduslaw.com/americans_with_disabilities_act_of_1990_ada_42_u_s_code_chapter_126"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 - ADA - 42 U.S. Code Chapter 126"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "November 6, 2006"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20111227074955/http://finduslaw.com/americans_with_disabilities_act_of_1990_ada_42_u_s_code_chapter_126"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "December 27, 2011"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "UnitedStatesCode", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "42"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12112(a)"}]}, {"name": "UnitedStatesCode", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "42"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12111(2)"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "EEOC"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/preemp.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "EEOC.gov"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2000-07-06"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "EEOC"}, {"name": "title", "value": "EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/preemp.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "EEOC.gov"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2000-07-06"}]}, {"name": "UnitedStatesCode", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "42"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12112(b)(5)"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "author1", "value": "EEOC"}, {"name": "title", "value": "EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "EEOC.gov"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2002-10-15"}]}, {"name": "UnitedStatesCode", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "42"}, {"name": "2", "value": "12111"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Disability Rights in the Supreme Court"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "January 27, 2016"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20020201040214/http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "February 1, 2002"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "df", "value": "mdy-all"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "{{anchor|Title II}} Title II\u2014public entities (and public transportation)", "paragraphs": "{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12131|12165}}.}}\n[[File:Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|thumb|upright|Access sign]]\n\nTitle II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level, ''e.g.'', school district, municipal, city, or county, and at state level.

Shown is a sign indicating an accessible fishing platform at [[Drano Lake]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].]]\nUnder Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal [[enjoyment]] of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.\n\nUnder Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)<ref name=ada90/> found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at 28&nbsp;C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix ''A''.\n\nTitle III also has applications to existing facilities. One of the definitions of \"discrimination\" under Title III of the ADA is a \"failure to remove\" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|42|12182|b|2|A|iv}}. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether \"removing barriers\" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is \"readily achievable\", defined as \"...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense\".\n\nThe statutory definition of \"readily achievable\" calls for a [[balancing test]] between the cost of the proposed \"fix\" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be \"readily achievable\" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.\n\nThere are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the \"maximum extent feasible\" but if following the usual standards would \"threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building\" then alternative standards may be used.\n\nUnder 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is \"readily achievable\".  Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in the application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=2013 ADA Pool Lift Compliance Deadline: Has Your Business Complied? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied |work=The National Law Review |publisher=Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed, P.A. |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Service animals ====\nThe ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm |title = ADA 2010 Revised Requirements: Service Animals |date=July 12, 2011 |publisher=US Department of Justice}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers: Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises.

The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual's impairment to one that \"severely or significantly restricts\" a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace \"severely or significantly\" with \"substantially limits\", a more lenient standard.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA |url=http://www1.eeoc.gov//laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm?renderforprint=1 |website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2008, President [[George W.

The amendment broadened the definition of \"disability\", thereby extending the ADA's protections to a greater number of people.<ref name=BLR>{{cite web |title=ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA)\u2014What Employers Need to Know |year=2008 |publisher=HR.BLR.com |url=http://www.blr.com/information-ada/}}</ref> The ADAAA also added to the ADA examples of \"major life activities\" including, but not limited to, \"caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working\" as well as the operation of several specified ''major bodily functions''.<ref name=BLR /> The act overturned a 1999 US Supreme Court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures. It also overturned the court restriction that an impairment which substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.<ref name=BLR />\nIn 2008, the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor]] stated that the amendment \"makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=United States of America Congressional Record Proceedings and Debates of the 110th Congress Second Session Volume 154-Part 10 |date=2008 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.

The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community based treatment facilities.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it \"...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.\" The court added, \"Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.\"\n\nTherefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.<ref name=Olmstead/>\n\n===''Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v.

Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by [[Ellerbe Becket]] Architects & Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing.

Williams|link=|volume=534|page=184|pin=|year=2002}}.</ref> was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase \"substantially impairs\" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial [[summary judgment]] in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the \"major life activity\" definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled.<ref name=Toyota/><ref name=\"workerrights\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GGRFPMUFUSkC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=TOYOTA+of+KY+v+Ella+WILLIAMS#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Workers' Rights |accessdate=October 7, 2009 |last=Worth |first=Richard |isbn=978-0-7614-2574-8 |date=November 15, 2007}}\n</ref> This ruling is now, however, no longer good law\u2014it was invalidated by the ADAAA.

BARNETT |publisher=Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute}}</ref> held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the company's seniority system.  While the court held that, in general, a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable, a plaintiff can present evidence that, despite the seniority system, the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.\n\nImportantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail, and that, once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system, it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.\n\nIn this case, Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back, rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo-handling job.  Invoking seniority, he transferred to a less-demanding mailroom job, but this position later became open to seniority-based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees.  Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less-demanding mailroom job.  US Airways denied his request, and he lost his job.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court, which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgment in favor of US Airways, as well as the circuit court's approach that interpreted 'reasonable accommodation' as 'effective accommodation.'\n\n===''Access Now v.

It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial [[summary judgment]] in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the \"major life activity\" definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled.<ref name=Toyota/><ref name=\"workerrights\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GGRFPMUFUSkC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=TOYOTA+of+KY+v+Ella+WILLIAMS#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Workers' Rights |accessdate=October 7, 2009 |last=Worth |first=Richard |isbn=978-0-7614-2574-8 |date=November 15, 2007}}\n</ref> This ruling is now, however, no longer good law\u2014it was invalidated by the ADAAA.

While the court held that, in general, a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable, a plaintiff can present evidence that, despite the seniority system, the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.\n\nImportantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail, and that, once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system, it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.\n\nIn this case, Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back, rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo-handling job.  Invoking seniority, he transferred to a less-demanding mailroom job, but this position later became open to seniority-based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees.

George Lane was unable to walk after a 1997 car accident in which he was accused of driving on the wrong side of the road. A woman was killed in the crash, and Lane faced misdemeanor charges of reckless driving.

He refused, citing he wanted to be treated as any other citizen, and was subsequently charged with failure to appear, after appearing at a previous hearing where he dragged himself up the stairs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mears |first1=Bill |title=CNN.com - Court debates disabled access liability - Jan. 13, 2004 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/01/13/scotus.disabled/ |accessdate=7 January 2020 |work=www.cnn.com}}</ref> The court ruled that Congress did have enough evidence that the disabled were being denied those fundamental rights that are protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and had the  enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
