However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].\n[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century bottle, [[Twa]] peoples, Rwanda, Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]\n\nOver time, [[philosopher]]s like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.<ref>Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73\u201396</ref> Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a\u2013c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.<ref>Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40\u201372</ref>\n\nWith regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a</ref> For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation\u2014through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III</ref> Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV</ref>\n\nThe more recent and specific sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''[[fine art]]'' emerged in the early 17th century.<ref>''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&nbsp;120</ref> Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.\n\nWithin this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.<ref>Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287\u2013326</ref>\n\nOften, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.<ref>David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992</ref> However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.\n\nThe nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\".<ref>Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}</ref> Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].<ref name=Levinson5/> [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.<ref name=\"Levinson5\">Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}</ref> [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R. G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.<ref>Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}</ref><ref>R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36\u201343</ref> The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early 20th century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.<ref>[[Martin Heidegger]], \"The Origin of the Work of Art\", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], \"C\u00e9zanne's Doubt\" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).</ref> [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as \"the [[art world]]\" has conferred \"the status of candidate for appreciation\".<ref>Kennick, William ed., and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}</ref> Larry Shiner has described fine art as \"not an essence or a fate but something we have made.

Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.<ref>Gombrich, p.83, pp.75\u2013115 pp.132\u2013141, pp.147\u2013155, p.163, p.627.</ref>\n\nIn [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of [[Catholic Europe]].<ref>Gombrich, pp. 86\u201389, pp. 135\u2013141, p. 143, p. 179, p. 185.</ref>\n\n[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.<ref name=\"Nichols2012\">{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}</ref>\n[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]].

Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=30}}</ref>\n\n[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, \"It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\"<ref>Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)</ref> [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.<ref name=\"Sangeeta2017\">{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which \"that which is\" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "History of art"}]},

Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249\u201357 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content \u2013 i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s \u2013 while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and significance.<ref name=\"Belton\"/>\n\nExtreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.<ref name=\"Livingston\">{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831\u201346 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67 |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831041725/https://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67/ |archive-date=31 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as \"Emperor-God beyond time and space\".<ref name=\"Belton\"/> Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is \"socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise\".<ref name=\"Belton\"/>\n\nFinally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Melahat K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckarslan |last1=Emiro\u011flu |first2=Fitnat Cim\u015fit |last2=Ko\u015f |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16\u201320 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref> The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.<ref name=\"Belton\"/>\n\n===Skill and craft===\n{{See also|Conceptual art#Conceptual art and artistic skill|l1=Conceptual art and artistic skill}}\n[[File:Michelangelo, Creation of Adam 03.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', detail from [[Michelangelo]]'s fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] (1511)]]\n\nArt can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]].

Spain, late 10th century]]\nArt has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (L\u00e9vi-Strauss).<ref name=\"Schiuma2011\">{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}</ref>\n\n===Non-motivated functions ===\nThe non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.<ref name=\"Schiuma2011\" />\n# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.<blockquote>Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. \u2013 Aristotle<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.<blockquote>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. \u2013 Albert Einstein<ref>Einstein, Albert. \"The World as I See It\". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.<blockquote>Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else\u2014something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. \u2013 Immanuel Kant<ref>Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.<blockquote>Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. \u2013 Silva Tomaskova<ref>Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Motivated functions ===\nMotivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.<ref name=\"Schiuma2011\" /><ref name=\"Stephanidis2011\">{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9\u201314, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529\u2013533}}</ref>\n# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.<blockquote>[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. \u2013 Steve Mithen<ref>Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.<ref name=\"Resources2014\">{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}</ref>\n# '''The Avant-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal\u2014[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others\u2014are collectively referred to as the ''avant-garde'' arts.<blockquote>By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Breton (Surrealism)<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Art as a \"free zone\"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.<ref>According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as \"a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.\": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].</ref>\n# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission.

The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.<ref name=\"Hogan2001\">{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}</ref>\n# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.<ref>[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''</ref>\n# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates.<ref name=\"Dutton\">[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. \"Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology\" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''.

In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.<ref name=\"Schiuma2011\" />\n# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.<blockquote>Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. \u2013 Aristotle<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.<blockquote>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. \u2013 Albert Einstein<ref>Einstein, Albert. \"The World as I See It\". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.<blockquote>Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else\u2014something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. \u2013 Immanuel Kant<ref>Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.<blockquote>Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. \u2013 Silva Tomaskova<ref>Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Aristotle"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Republic"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "[Book 10:] The Poetics"}, {"name": "others", "value": "Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.authorama.com"}]}], "id": 6}, {"title": "Motivated functions ", "paragraphs": "Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator.

Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.<blockquote>[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. \u2013 Steve Mithen<ref>Steve Mithen.

Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal\u2014[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others\u2014are collectively referred to as the ''avant-garde'' arts.<blockquote>By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Breton (Surrealism)<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)</ref></blockquote>\n# '''Art as a \"free zone\"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.<ref>According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as \"a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.\": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].</ref>\n# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission.

Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood.

In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.<ref>[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''</ref>\n# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates.<ref name=\"Dutton\">[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. \"Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology\" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''.

The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s.

Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art.

[[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].

This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W.

Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.</ref> Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:\n{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting\u2014the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment\u2014were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly.

Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history.

This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.<ref name=\"Waugh2006\">{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}</ref><ref name=\"Colebrook1997\">{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, [[W.

This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.<ref>''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.</ref>\n\nDecisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled \"The Innocent Eye\" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].<ref>''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.</ref> [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960\u201361 [[John Locke lectures]].</ref> He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as [[Nick Zangwill]] strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.<ref>Nick Zangwill, \"Feasible Aesthetic Formalism\", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610\u201329.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Aesthetics"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-415-06700-6"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art.

In ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'', Larry Shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts, i.e. fine art. He finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity; for example, Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art, but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history.

This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.<ref>''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.</ref>\n\nDecisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled \"The Innocent Eye\" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].<ref>''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.</ref> [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''.

Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as [[Nick Zangwill]] strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.<ref>Nick Zangwill, \"Feasible Aesthetic Formalism\", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610\u201329.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 13}, {"title": "Classification disputes", "paragraphs": "{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}\n[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.
