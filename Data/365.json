He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by [[Garry Kasparov]]. He played five matches against Kasparov for the title from 1984 to 1990, before becoming [[FIDE]] World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules.

His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a [[Candidate Master]] by age 11.

He later transferred to [[Leningrad State University]], eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster [[Semyon Furman]], who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\n\nIn 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at [[Stockholm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Wch_U20_fin-A_1969/26788 |title=Wch U20 fin-A 1969 \u2013 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in [[Caracas]], Venezuela,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Caracas_1970/22885 |title=Caracas 1970 \u2013 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> and was awarded the [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] title.\n\n===Top-Class Grandmaster===\nHe won the 1971 [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]] Memorial in Moscow (equal with [[Leonid Stein]]), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the [[USSR Chess Championship]], and finished equal first with [[Viktor Korchnoi]] in the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Interzonal]] Tournament. The latter success qualified him for the 1974 [[Candidates Matches]], which would determine the challenger to the reigning world champion, [[Bobby Fischer]].\n\n===Candidate===\nKarpov defeated [[Lev Polugaevsky]] by the score of +3=5 in the first Candidates' match, earning the right to face former champion [[Boris Spassky]] in the semifinal round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates' cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates' cycle in 1977.\nSpassky won the first game as Black in good style, but tenacious, aggressive play from Karpov secured him overall victory by +4\u22121=6.\nThe Candidates' final was played in Moscow with Korchnoi. Karpov took an early lead, winning the second game against the [[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Dragon]], then scoring another victory in the sixth game. Following ten consecutive [[draw (chess)|draws]], Korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Karpov a 3\u20130 lead. In game 19, Korchnoi succeeded in winning a long [[chess endgame|endgame]], then notched a speedy victory after a blunder by Karpov two games later. Three more draws, the last [[draw by agreement|agreed]] by Karpov in a clearly better position, closed the match, as he thus prevailed +3\u22122=19, moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title.\n\n===Match with Fischer in 1975===\nThough a world championship match between Karpov and Fischer was highly anticipated, those hopes were never realised. Fischer not only insisted that the match be the first to ten wins ([[draw (chess)|draws]] not counting), but also that the champion retain the crown if the score was tied 9\u20139. [[FIDE]], the International Chess Federation, refused to allow this proviso, and after Fischer's resignation of the championship on June 27, 1975, FIDE declared that Fischer forfeited his crown. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but the negotiations fell through. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.\n[[Garry Kasparov]] argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.<ref>''Kasparov, [[My Great Predecessors]], part IV: Fischer, p. 474''</ref> Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.<ref>In [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf an article] (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website [[Susan Polgar]] wrote: \"I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch.\"</ref>\n\n===World champion===<!-- This section is linked from [[World Chess Championship]] -->\nDetermined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He convincingly won the very strong [[Milan]] tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (9) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14). As a result, most chess professionals soon agreed that Karpov was a legitimate world champion.<ref name=\"WinningChessStrategies\">{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Strategies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443851}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 1973\u201375 Candidates' cycle; the match was played at [[Baguio]], Philippines, with the winner needing six victories.\nAs in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match. When the score was +5\u22122=20 in Karpov's favour, Korchnoi staged a comeback, and won three of the next four games to draw level with Karpov. Karpov then won the very next game to retain the title (+6\u22125=21).\n\nThree years later Korchnoi reemerged as the Candidates' winner against German finalist [[Robert H\u00fcbner]] to challenge Karpov in [[Merano]], Italy. Karpov handily won this match,  11\u20137 (+6\u22122=10), in what is remembered as the \"Massacre in Merano\".\n\nKarpov's tournament career reached a peak at the [[Montreal]] \"Tournament of Stars\" tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7\u22121=10) with [[Mikhail Tal]] ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojevi\u0107]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vlastimil Hort]], [[Lajos Portisch]], H\u00fcbner, [[Bent Larsen]] and [[Lubomir Kavalek]]. He dominated [[Las Palmas]] 1977 with 13\u00bd/15. He also won the prestigious [[Bugojno]] tournament in 1978 (shared), 1980 and 1986, the [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] in 1981 (shared with [[Larry Christiansen]]) and 1994, the [[Tilburg]] tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]] in 1976, 1983, and 1988.\n\nKarpov represented the Soviet Union at six [[Chess Olympiads]], in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal. He played first reserve at [[20th Chess Olympiad|Skopje 1972]], winning the board prize with 13/15. At [[21st Chess Olympiad|Nice 1974]], he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12/14. At [[24th Chess Olympiad|La Valletta 1980]], he was again board one and scored 9/12. At [[25th Chess Olympiad|Lucerne 1982]], he scored 6\u00bd/8 on board one. At [[27th Chess Olympiad|Dubai 1986]], he scored 6/9 on board two. His last was [[28th Chess Olympiad|Thessaloniki 1988]], where on board two he scored 8/10. In Olympiad play, Karpov lost only two games out of 68 played.\n\nTo illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11\u22122=20 versus Spassky, +5=12 versus [[Robert H\u00fcbner]], +6\u22121=16 versus [[Ulf Andersson]], +3\u22121=10 versus [[Vasily Smyslov]], +1=16 versus [[Mikhail Tal]], and +10\u22122=13 versus Ljubojevi\u0107.\n\nKarpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion by the time [[Garry Kasparov]] arrived on the scene. In their first match, the [[World Chess Championship 1984]] in Moscow, the first player to win six games would win the match. Karpov built a 4\u20130 lead after nine games. The next 17 games were drawn, setting a record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which 14 more draws ensued. Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won games 47 and 48, FIDE President [[Florencio Campomanes]] unilaterally terminated the match, citing the players' health.<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov\u2013Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> Karpov is said to have lost 10kg over the course of the match.<ref>[https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=55015 Karpov vs Kasparov, 1984-85]</ref> The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and 40 draws.\n\nA rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, with a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match finished 12\u201312). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but lost, surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 13\u201311 (+3\u22125=16) in favour of Kasparov.\n\n===Rivalry with Kasparov===\nKarpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world No. 2) until the early 1990s. He fought Kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 (held in London and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]), 1987 (in [[Seville]]), and 1990 (in New York City and [[Lyon]]). All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11\u00bd\u201312\u00bd (+4\u22125=15), 12\u201312 (+4\u22124=16), and 11\u00bd\u201312\u00bd (+3\u22124=17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under time pressure at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.\n\nIn their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.\n\nKarpov is on record saying that if he had had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he could have been a much better player as a result.\n\n===FIDE champion again (1993\u20131999)===\n[[Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg|thumb|Karpov in 1993]]\nIn 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against [[Nigel Short]]. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov defeated Timman \u2013 the loser of the Candidates' final against Short.\n\nThe next major meeting of Kasparov and Karpov was the 1994 [[Linares chess tournament]]. The field, in eventual finishing order, was Karpov, Kasparov, [[Alexei Shirov|Shirov]], [[Evgeny Bareev|Bareev]], [[Vladimir Kramnik|Kramnik]], [[Jo\u00ebl Lautier|Lautier]], [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]], [[Gata Kamsky|Kamsky]], [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]], [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Boris Gelfand|Gelfand]], [[Miguel Illescas|Illescas]], [[Judit Polg\u00e1r]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky|Beliavsky]]; with an average [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2685, the highest ever at that time. Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament|San Remo in 1930]]), finishing 2\u00bd points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov is considered possibly the finest of his career). This performance against the best players in the world put his [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] tournament performance at 2985, the highest [[Performance rating (chess)|performance rating]] of any player in history up until 2009, when [[Magnus Carlsen]] won the category XXI [[Pearl Spring chess tournament]] with a performance of 3002. Chess statistician [[Jeff Sonas]] considers Karpov's Linares performance the best tournament result in history.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5828 Facts and figures: Magnus Carlsen's performance in Nanjing]. ChessBase.com. Retrieved on 2009-10-26.</ref>\n\nKarpov defended his FIDE title against [[Gata Kamsky]] (+6\u22123=9) in 1996. In 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidates' Matches, instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998]], champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating [[Viswanathan Anand]] (+2\u22122=2, rapid tiebreak 2\u20130). In the subsequent cycle, the format was changed, with the champion having to qualify. Karpov refused to defend his title, and ceased to be FIDE World Champion after the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1999]].\n\n===Towards retirement===\nKarpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1997, since he prefers to be more involved in Russian politics. He had been a member of the [[Supreme Soviet]] Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union dissolved. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the September 2009 FIDE rating list, he dropped out of the world's Top 100 for the first time.\n\nKarpov usually limits his play to exhibition events, and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess.

This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.\n[[Garry Kasparov]] argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.<ref>''Kasparov, [[My Great Predecessors]], part IV: Fischer, p. 474''</ref> Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.<ref>In [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf an article] (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website [[Susan Polgar]] wrote: \"I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch.\"</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 6}, {"title": "World champion", "paragraphs": "Determined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years.

When the score was +5\u22122=20 in Karpov's favour, Korchnoi staged a comeback, and won three of the next four games to draw level with Karpov.

Karpov handily won this match,  11\u20137 (+6\u22122=10), in what is remembered as the \"Massacre in Merano\".\n\nKarpov's tournament career reached a peak at the [[Montreal]] \"Tournament of Stars\" tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7\u22121=10) with [[Mikhail Tal]] ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojevi\u0107]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vlastimil Hort]], [[Lajos Portisch]], H\u00fcbner, [[Bent Larsen]] and [[Lubomir Kavalek]].

In their first match, the [[World Chess Championship 1984]] in Moscow, the first player to win six games would win the match. Karpov built a 4\u20130 lead after nine games. The next 17 games were drawn, setting a record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which 14 more draws ensued. Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw.

The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, with a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match finished 12\u201312). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but lost, surrendering the title to his opponent.

Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament|San Remo in 1930]]), finishing 2\u00bd points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov.
