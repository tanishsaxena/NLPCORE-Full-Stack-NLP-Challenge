He was the second son of King [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]] and successor of his brother [[Peter I of Aragon|Peter I]]. With his marriage to [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], queen regnant of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|Emperor of Spain]], formerly employed by his father-in-law, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso VI]]. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the [[Reconquista]]. He won his greatest military successes in the middle [[Ebro]], where he conquered [[Zaragoza]] in 1118 and took [[Ejea de los Caballeros|Ejea]], [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Calatayud]], [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], [[Tarazona]], [[Daroca]], and [[Monreal del Campo]]. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the [[Muslims]] at the [[Battle of Fraga]].\n\nHis nickname comes from the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] version of the ''[[Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]'' (c. 1370), which says that \"they called him lord Alfonso the battler because in Spain there wasn't as good a knight who won twenty-nine battles\" (''clamabanlo don Alfonso batallador porque en Espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas ven\u00e7i\u00f3'').<ref>Carmen Orc\u00e1stegui Gros (ed.), [https://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/10/06/7orcastegui.pdf \"Cr\u00f3nica de San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a (Versi\u00f3n aragonesa)\"], ''Cuadernos de Historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita'', 51\u201352 (Zaragoza, Instituci\u00f3n \u00abFernando el Cat\u00f3lico\u00bb, 1985), p. 459.</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "July 2013"}]}, {"name": "Infobox royalty\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Alfonso I"}, {"name": "image", "value": "File:Estatua de Alfonso I de Arag\u00f3n.jpg"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Statue of Alfonso in the ''Parque Grande Jos\u00e9 Antonio Labordeta'', Zaragoza"}, {"name": "image_size", "value": "225px"}, {"name": "succession", "value": "[[King of Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]"}, {"name": "reign", "value": "28 September 1104{{snd}}{{nowrap|8 September 1134}}"}, {"name": "predecessor", "value": "[[Peter I of Aragon|Peter I]]"}, {"name": "successor", "value": "[[Ramiro II of Aragon]]<br>[[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre]]"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "[[Urraca of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] <small>(annulled 1112)</small>"}, {"name": "house", "value": "[[House of Jim\u00e9nez]]"}, {"name": "father", "value": "[[Sancho Ram\u00edrez|Sancho Ram\u00edrez of Aragon and Navarre]]"}, {"name": "mother", "value": "[[Felicie de Roucy]]"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "''c''. 1073/1074"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "8 September 1134 (aged ''c''. 60)"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Pole\u00f1ino]], Spain"}, {"name": "place of burial", "value": "[[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo]]"}, {"name": "religion", "value": "[[Roman Catholicism]]"}]}, {"name": "nowrap", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "8 September 1134"}]}, {"name": "lang-es", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "el Batallador"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Biography", "paragraphs": "===Early life===\n[[File:Dinero_Alfonso_I_el_Batallador_(theBattler).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A denarius minted by Alfonso in Toledo while he ruled Castile]]\nHis earliest years were passed in the [[Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa|monastery of Siresa]], learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of Lope Garc\u00e9s the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of [[Pedrola]] when Alfonso came to the throne.\n\nDuring his brother's reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the [[Battle of Alcoraz]], 1096), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital.  He also joined [[El Cid]]'s expeditions in [[Valencia (taifa)|Valencia]].  His father gave him the lordships of [[Biel, Zaragoza|Biel]], [[Luna, Zaragoza|Luna]], [[Ardenes]], and [[Bailo, Spain|Bailo]].\n\nA series of deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne.  His brother's children, Isabella and Peter (who married Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, daughter of [[El Cid]]), died in 1103 and 1104 respectively.\n\n===Matrimonial conflicts===\nA passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married  (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in 1109 to the ambitious Queen [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n]], widow of [[Raymond of Burgundy]], a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role.  The marriage had been arranged by her father [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the [[Almoravides|Almoravids]], and to supply them with a capable military leader.  But Urraca was tenacious of her right as [[queen regnant]] and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war, even placing Urraca under siege at Astorga in 1112.<ref>Bernard F. Reilly, ''The Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain, 1031-1157'', (Blackwell, 1995), 133-134.</ref> Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the [[Battle of Candespina]] and the [[Battle of Viadangos]], but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the Pope, as they were second cousins, in 1110, but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with Urraca until 1114.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso I., king of Aragon|volume=1|pages=734-735}}</ref> During his marriage, he had called himself \"King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Arag\u00f3n, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza\" in recognition of his rights as Urraca's husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]]; and his prerogative to conquer [[Andalusia]] from the Muslims.  He inserted the title of ''imperator'' on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule.\n\nAlfonso's late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women. Ibn al-Athir (1166\u20131234) describes Alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover, whom when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of Muslim chiefs, responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women.<ref>Quoted in Lourie 1975:639 note.

The intervention of [[Pope Calixtus II]] brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1122 in Belchite, he founded [[Confraternity of Belchite|a confraternity of knights]] to fight against the Almoravids.  It was the start of the military orders in Aragon.  Years later, he organised a branch of the ''Militia Christi'' of the [[Holy Land]] at [[Monreal del Campo]].\n\n===Military expansion===\nAlfonso spent his first four years as king in near-constant war with the Muslims.  In 1105, he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol.  In 1106, he defeated [[Ahmad II al-Musta'in]] of Zaragoza at Valtierra.  In 1107, he took Tamarite de Litera and Esteban de la Litera.  Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and Le\u00f3n through his wife, Urraca.  He resumed his conquest in 1117 by conquering [[Fitero]], [[Corella, Spain|Corella]], [[Cintru\u00e9nigo]], [[Murchante]], [[Monteagudo, Navarre|Monteagudo]], and [[Cascante]].\n\nIn 1118, the Council of Toulouse declared a [[crusade]] to assist in the conquest of [[Zaragoza]].  Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at [[Ayerbe]].  They took Almud\u00e9var, Gurrea de G\u00e1llego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May. The city fell on 18 December, and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower.  The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard.  Promptly, the city was made Alfonso's capital.  Two years later, in 1120, he defeated a Muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the [[Battle of Cutanda]]. He promulgated the ''fuero'' of ''tortum per tortum'', facilitating taking the law into one's own hands, which among others reassumed the Muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs.\n\n[[File:Cerit1.jpg|thumb|left|Alfonso receiving the homage of the men of the late Count [[Girard I of Roussillon]]. A miniature from the ''[[Liber feudorum Ceritaniae]]''.]]\nIn 1119, he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castell\u00f3n, Tarazona, \u00c1greda, Magall\u00f3n, Borja, Alag\u00f3n, Novillas, Mall\u00e9n, Rueda, \u00c9pila and populated the region of [[Soria]].  He began the siege of [[Calatayud]], but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza.  When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Arag\u00f3n, Ariza, and Daroca (1120).  In 1123, he besieged and took [[Lleida]], which was in the hands of the [[count of Barcelona]].  From the winter of 1124 to September 1125, he was on a risky expedition to Pe\u00f1a Cadiella deep in Andalusia.\n\nIn the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had claims as usurper-king of Navarre.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> From 1125 to 1126, he was on campaign against [[Granada]], where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]], where he got only as far as Motril.  In 1127, he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to [[alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]].  He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year (1128) with the [[Peace of T\u00e1mara]], which fixed the boundaries of the two realms.\n\nHe conquered Molina de Arag\u00f3n and populated [[Monz\u00f3n]] in 1129, before besieging [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], which had fallen again upon the Cid's death.\n\nHe went north of the Pyrenees in October 1130 to protect the [[Val d'Aran]].  Early in 1131, he besieged [[Bayonne]].  It is said he ruled \"from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal.\"\n\nAt the [[Siege of Bayonne]] in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent - the [[Knights Templars]], the [[Hospitallers]], and the Knights of the [[Holy Sepulchre]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alfonso's character, one that effectively undid his life's work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso's attempt to neutralize the papacy's interest in a disputed succession \u2014 Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068 \u2014 and to fend off Urraca's son from her first marriage, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament.<ref>[[Pope Innocent II]] indeed did write Alfonso VII to just this effect, 10 June 1135 or 36 (Lourie 1995:645).</ref> Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alfonso VII's ambitions to break it \u2014 and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out \u2014 instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers \u2014 an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alfonso's hidden intent.\n\nHis final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him.  It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. His tomb is in the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|monastery of San Pedro]] in [[Huesca]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "EB1911", "values": [{"name": "inline", "value": "y"}, {"name": "wstitle", "value": "Alphonso"}, {"name": "display", "value": "Alphonso s.v.

It is said he ruled \"from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal.\"\n\nAt the [[Siege of Bayonne]] in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent - the [[Knights Templars]], the [[Hospitallers]], and the Knights of the [[Holy Sepulchre]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alfonso's character, one that effectively undid his life's work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso's attempt to neutralize the papacy's interest in a disputed succession \u2014 Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068 \u2014 and to fend off Urraca's son from her first marriage, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament.<ref>[[Pope Innocent II]] indeed did write Alfonso VII to just this effect, 10 June 1135 or 36 (Lourie 1995:645).</ref> Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alfonso VII's ambitions to break it \u2014 and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out \u2014 instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers \u2014 an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alfonso's hidden intent.\n\nHis final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him.  It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. His tomb is in the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|monastery of San Pedro]] in [[Huesca]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 5}, {"title": "Death", "paragraphs": "\n===Succession===\n[[File:A box (reliquary) of the bones (relics) of Alfonso the Battler.PNG|thumb|A box ([[reliquary]]) containing the bones ([[relics]]) of Alfonso the Battler, with the skull centre, facing the viewer.

Alfonso's only brother, [[Ramiro II of Aragon|Ramiro]], had been a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk since childhood, and his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession.

The nobility of Navarre aligned behind [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], the grandson of Alfonso's illegitimate uncle, while the Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro.  A convention was called at [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]] to develop a consensus, but there Peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him, yet were unwilling to accept Ramiro.
