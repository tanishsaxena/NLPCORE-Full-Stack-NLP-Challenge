Upon ascending the throne, Ahmed I appointed [[Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha]] as the commander of the eastern army. The army marched from Constantinople on 15 June 1604, which was too late, and by the time it had arrived on the eastern front on 8 November 1604, the [[Safavid]] army had captured [[Yerevan]] and entered the [[Kars Eyalet]], and could only be stopped in [[Akhaltsikhe]]. Despite the conditions being favourable, Sinan Pasha decided to stay for the winter in [[Van, Turkey|Van]], but then marched to [[Erzurum]] to stop an incoming Safavid attack. This caused unrest within the army and the year was practically wasted for the Ottomans.<ref name=islamans>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/pdf/c02/c020017.pdf| title=Ahmed I |encyclopedia=\u0130slam Ansiklopedisi |publisher=T\u00fcrk Diyanet Vakf\u0131 |pages=30\u201333 |year=1989 | volume=1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1605, Sinan Pasha marched to take [[Tabriz]], but the army was undermined by [[K\u00f6se Sefer Pasha]], the [[Beylerbey]] of Erzurum, marching independently from Sinan Pasha and consequently being taken prisoner by the Safavids. The Ottoman army was routed at [[Battle of Urmia (1604)|Urmia]] and had to flee firstly to Van and then to [[Diyarbak\u0131r|Diyarbekir]]. Here, Sinan Pasha sparked a rebellion by executing the Beylerbey of [[Aleppo]], [[Canbulato\u011flu H\u00fcseyin Pasha]], who had come to provide help, upon the pretext that he had arrived too late. He soon died himself and the Safavid army was able to capture [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Shirvan]] and [[Shamakhi]] in Azerbaijan.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== War with the Habsburgs: 1604\u201306 ===\nThe [[Long Turkish War]] between the Ottomans and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] had been going on for over a decade by the time Ahmed ascended the throne.  Grand Vizier [[Malko\u00e7 Ali Pasha]] marched to the western front from Constantinople on 3 June 1604 and arrived in [[Belgrade]], but died there, so [[Lala Mehmed Pasha]] was appointed as the Grand Vizier and the commander of the western army. Under Mehmed Pasha, the western army recaptured [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[V\u00e1c]], but failed to capture [[Esztergom]] as the siege was lifted due to unfavourable weather and the objections of the soldiers. Meanwhile, the Prince of [[Transylvania]], [[Stephen Bocskay]], who struggled for the region's independence and had formerly supported the Habsburgs, sent a messenger to the Porte asking for help. Upon the promise of help, his forces also joined the Ottoman forces in Belgrade. With this help, the Ottoman army besieged Esztergom and captured it on 4 November 1605. Bocskai, with Ottoman help, captured [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky]] (Uyvar) and forces under [[Tiryaki Hasan Pasha]] took [[Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[V\u00e1rpalota|Palota]]. [[Sarho\u015f \u0130brahim Pasha]], the Beylerbey of [[Nagykanizsa]] (Kanije), attacked the Austrian region of [[Istria]].<ref name=islamans/>\n[[File:Sultan Ahmed I.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman miniature]] of Ahmed I. ]]\nHowever, with Jelali revolts in Anatolia more dangerous than ever and a defeat in the eastern front, Mehmed Pasha was called to Constantinople. Mehmed Pasha suddenly died there, whilst preparing to leave for the east. [[Kuyucu Murad Pasha]] then negotiated the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]], which abolished the tribute of 30,000 ducats paid by Austria and addressed the Habsburg emperor as the equal of the Ottoman sultan. The Jelali revolts were a strong factor in the Ottomans' acceptance of the terms. This signaled the end of Ottoman growth in Europe.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Jelali revolts ===\nResentment over the war with the Habsburgs and heavy taxation, along with the weakness of the Ottoman military response, combined to make the reign of Ahmed I the zenith of the [[Jelali revolts]]. Tavil Ahmed launched a revolt soon after the coronation of Ahmed I and defeated [[Nasuh Pasha]] and the Beylerbey of Anatolia, Kecdehan Ali Pasha. In 1605, Tavil Ahmed was offered the position of the Beylerbey of [[Shahrizor]] to stop his rebellion, but soon afterwards he went on to capture [[Harput]]. His son, Mehmed, obtained the governorship of [[Baghdad]] with a fake [[firman]] and defeated the forces of Nasuh Pasha sent to defeat him.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nMeanwhile, Canbulato\u011flu Ali Pasha united his forces with the [[Druze]] Sheikh Ma'no\u011flu Fahreddin to defeat the Amir of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] Seyfo\u011flu Yusuf. He went on to take control of the [[Adana]] area, forming an army and issuing coins. His forces routed the army of the newly appointed Beylerbey of Aleppo, H\u00fcseyin Pasha. Grand Vizier [[Bo\u015fnak Dervish Mehmed Pasha]] was executed for the weakness he showed against the Jelalis. He was replaced by Kuyucu Murad Pasha, who marched to Syria with his forces to defeat the 30,000-strong rebel army with great difficulty, albeit with a decisive result, on 24 October 1607. Meanwhile, he pretended to forgive the rebels in Anatolia and appointed the rebel Kalendero\u011flu, who was active in [[Manisa]] and [[Bursa]], as the [[sanjakbey]] of [[Ankara]]. Baghdad was recaptured in 1607 as well. Canbulato\u011flu Ali Pasha fled to Constantinople and asked for forgiveness from Ahmed I, who appointed him to [[Timi\u0219oara]] and later Belgrade, but then executed him due to his misrule there. Meanwhile, Kalendero\u011flu was not allowed in the city by the people of Ankara and rebelled again, only to be crushed by Murad Pasha's forces. Kalendero\u011flu ended up fleeing to Persia. Murad Pasha then suppressed some smaller revolts in Central Anatolia and suppressed other Jelali chiefs by inviting them to join the army.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nDue to the widespread violence of the Jelali revolts, a great number of people had fled their villages and a lot of villages were destroyed. Some military chiefs had claimed these abandoned villages as their property. This deprived the Porte of tax income and on 30 September 1609, Ahmed I issued a letter guaranteeing the rights of the villagers. He then worked on the resettlement of abandoned villages.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Ottoman-Safavid War: Peace and continuation ===\n[[File:Savary Franco Ottoman Capitulations 1615.jpg|thumb|200px|Bilingual Franco-Turkish translation of the 1604 [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman Capitulations]] between Ahmed I and [[Henry IV of France]], published by [[Fran\u00e7ois Savary de Br\u00e8ves]] in 1615<ref name=\"Bosworth\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA799 |title='&#39;The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid'&#39; by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>]]\n\nThe new Grand Vizier, Nasuh Pasha, did not want to fight with the Safavids. The Safavid Shah also sent a letter saying that he was willing to sign a peace, with which he would have to send 200 loads of [[silk]] every year to Constantinople. On 20 November 1612, the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha]] was signed, which ceded all the lands the Ottoman Empire had gained in the war of 1578\u201390 back to Persia and reinstated the 1555 boundaries.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nHowever, the peace ended in 1615 when the Shah did not send the 200 loads of silk. On 22 May 1615, Grand Vizier [[\u00d6k\u00fcz Mehmed Pasha]] was assigned to organize an attack on Persia. Mehmed Pasha delayed the attack till the next year, until when the Safavids made their preparations and attacked Ganja. In April 1616, Mehmed Pasha left Aleppo with a large army and marched to Yerevan, where he failed to take the city and withdrew to Erzurum. He was removed from his post and replaced by [[Damat Halil Pasha]]. Halil Pasha went for the winter to Diyarbekir, while the Khan of Crimea, [[Canibek Giray]], attacked the areas of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhichevan]] and [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]].<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Capitulations and trade treaties ===\nAhmed I renewed trade treaties with England, France and Venice. In July 1612, the first ever trade treaty with the [[Dutch Republic]] was signed. He expanded the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]] given to France, specifying that merchants from [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Ancona]] and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Florence]] could trade under the French flag.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Architect and service to Islam ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Madina trip 200.jpg|thumb|Ahmed I plate at Masjid al-Nabawi marking Bab al-Tawba]]\n\n\nSultan Ahmed constructed the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, the magnum opus of the Ottoman architecture,{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} across from the [[Hagia Sophia]]. The sultan attended the breaking of the ground with a golden pickaxe to begin the construction of the mosque complex. An incident nearly broke out after the sultan discovered that the Blue Mosque contained the same number of minarets as the grand mosque of Mecca. Ahmed became furious at this fault and became remorseful until the Shaykh-ul-Islam recommended that he should erect another minaret at the grand mosque of Mecca and the matter was solved.\n\n[[File:Blue Mosque.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]]]]\n\nAhmed became delightedly involved in the eleventh comprehensive renovations of the [[Kaaba]], which had just been damaged by flooding. He sent craftsmen from Constantinople, and the golden rain gutter that kept rain from collecting on the roof of the Ka\u2019ba was successfully renewed. It was again during the era of Sultan Ahmed that an iron web was placed inside the [[Zamzam Well]] in Mecca. The placement of this web about three feet below the water level was a response to lunatics who jumped into the well, imagining a promise of a heroic death.\n\nIn Medina, the city of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], a new pulpit made of white marble and shipped from Istanbul arrived in the mosque of the prophet and substituted the old, worn-out pulpit. It is also known that Sultan Ahmed erected two more mosques in Uskudar on the Asian side of Istanbul; however, neither of them has survived.\n\nThe sultan had a crest carved with the footprint of Muhammad that he would wear on Fridays and festive days and illustrated one of the most significant examples of affection to the prophet in Ottoman history. Engraved inside the crest was a poem he composed:\n{{quote|\u201cIf only could I bear over my head like my turban forever thee, If only I could carry it all the time with me, on my head like a crown, the Footprint of the Prophet Muhammad, which has a beautiful complexion, Ahmed, go on, rub your face on the feet of that rose.\u201c}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Peirce"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Leslie"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Oxford University Press"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "[https://archive.org/details/imperialharemwom00peir/page/99 99]"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1993"}, {"name": "ISBN", "value": "0-19-508677-5"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/imperialharemwom00peir/page/99"}]}, {"name": "citation needed", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2016"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1438110251"}]}, {"name": "cite encyclopedia ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/pdf/c02/c020017.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Ahmed I"}, {"name": "encyclopedia", "value": "\u0130slam Ansiklopedisi"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "T\u00fcrk Diyanet Vakf\u0131"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "30\u201333"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1989"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "1"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA799"}, {"name": "title", "value": "'&#39;The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid'&#39; by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Books.google.com"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2012-01-26"}]}, {"name": "unreferenced section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2016"}]}, {"name": "According to whom", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "December 2017"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u201cIf only could I bear over my head like my turban forever thee, If only I could carry it all the time with me, on my head like a crown, the Footprint of the Prophet Muhammad, which has a beautiful complexion, Ahmed, go on, rub your face on the feet of that rose.\u201c"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": " Ottoman-Safavid War: 1604\u201306 ", "paragraphs": "\nThe [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1603\u201318)|Ottoman\u2013Safavid War]] had begun shortly before the death of Ahmed's father Mehmed III.

Canbulato\u011flu Ali Pasha fled to Constantinople and asked for forgiveness from Ahmed I, who appointed him to [[Timi\u0219oara]] and later Belgrade, but then executed him due to his misrule there. Meanwhile, Kalendero\u011flu was not allowed in the city by the people of Ankara and rebelled again, only to be crushed by Murad Pasha's forces. Kalendero\u011flu ended up fleeing to Persia.
