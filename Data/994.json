He was a hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburgh's businesses and the faces of important men. He made many connections this way. He also paid close attention to his work, and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced. He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip,<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp. 56, 59</ref> and within a year was promoted to operator. Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night.<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 45</ref> Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a \"[[self-made man]]\" in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development. He was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he \"resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [to see to it] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Stuart A.P. |title=The Library: An Illustrated History |date=2009 |publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]] |location=New York |isbn=9781602397064}}</ref> His capacity, his willingness for hard work, his perseverance and his alertness soon brought him opportunities.\n\nStarting in 1853, when Carnegie was around 18 years old, [[Thomas A. Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed him as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|4.00|1853|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation). Carnegie accepted the job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience there than with the telegraph company.<ref name=\"Nasaw\"/> At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\">Edge (2004) p. 35.</ref> On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country.<ref>Edge (2004) p. 37</ref> As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year (${{Inflation|US|1500|1859|r=-3|fmt=c}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\"/> His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.<ref name=\"Nasaw\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 54\u201359, 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nScott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties \"as part of a [[quid pro quo]]\".<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 59\u201360.</ref> In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing of a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\"/><ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 79</ref> A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.\n\n===1860\u20131865: The Civil War===\nBefore the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]], which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}. The investment proved a success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Carnegie, Andrew|volume=5|pages=364\u201365}}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was \"the first casualty of the war\" when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.\n\nDefeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.\n\n===Keystone Bridge Company===\nIn 1864, Carnegie was one of the early investors in the Columbia Oil Company in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Story Farm, Columbia Farm, Columbia Oil Company\n*{{cite web |url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/phi/v10_2009/randolph.htm |title=Columbia Oil Farm of the Oil Creek Valley, Venago County, PA : 150 Years of Petroleum Legacy |date=2001 |publisher=Petroleum History Institute}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Columbia/Columbia.html |title=Andrew Carnegie and the Columbia Oil Farm |work=Oil History |publisher=petroleumhistory.org}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Columbia/Story.html |title=William Story Farm |date=2001 |publisher=Petroleum History Institute}}</ref> In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.\n\nAfter the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several ironworks, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions, which Carnegie exploited to his advantage.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 105\u2013107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie circa 1878 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, c. 1878]]\nCarnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote:\n{{quote|I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes! Let us cast aside business forever, except for others. Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men. I figure that this will take three years' active work. I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public. We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of [[idolatry]]! No idol is more debasing than the worship of money!

One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the [[Bessemer process]], which allowed the high carbon content of [[pig iron]] to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during [[steel production]]. Steel prices dropped as a result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last=Rosenberg |first=Nathan |year=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/90 90] |url=https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/90 }} Bessemer steel suffered from nitrogen embrittlement with age</ref>\n\nThe second was in his [[vertical integration]] of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig iron|pig metal]] per day. In 1883, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway, and a line of [[Great Lakes freighter|lake steamships]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Carnegie |title=Andrew Carnegie {{!}} Biography & Facts |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-08-23 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.\n\n====1901: U.S. Steel====\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie, Vanity Fair, 1903-10-29.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Carnegie caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1903]]\nIn 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[Joint-stock company|joint stock corporation]]s as preparation for this. [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.\n\nThe buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.<ref name=\"Hawke 1980\"/>\n\nCarnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion \u2013 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Krass |first1=Peter |title=Carnegie |date=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0471386308 |page=Chapter 29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwJ-UFP20mMC&pg=PT416&lpg=PT416&dq=carnegie+vault+for+us+steel+bonds&source=bl&ots=GqHK7rwNbo&sig=ACfU3U0BRm787CPhPNUnsx3xTwN0dX7KgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlob-8jZrmAhUjZN8KHVsWBvgQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=carnegie%20vault%20for%20us%20steel%20bonds&f=false |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Scholar and activist===\n====1880\u20131900====\nCarnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended the English poet [[Matthew Arnold]], the English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], and the American humorist [[Mark Twain]], as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]],{{sfnp |Winkler |2006 |p=172}} statesmen, and notable writers.{{sfnp |Winkler |2006 |p=13}}\n\nCarnegie constructed commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in [[Dunfermline]] in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave \u00a38,000 for the establishment of a [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[NYU Langone Medical Center|New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the Carnegie Laboratory.\n\nIn 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a [[Carnegie library]] which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with [[Samuel Storey]], he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of \"the British Republic\". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around [[Lake Superior]]. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain''.\n\n[[File:James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce & Andrew Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, right, with [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in 1886]]\nAlthough actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]''. Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.\n\nIn 1889, Carnegie published \"Wealth\" in the June issue of the ''North American Review''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html |journal=North American Review |title=Wealth |author=Carnegie, Andrew |date=June 1889 }}</ref> After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile.\n\nCarnegie was a well-regarded writer. He published three books on travel.<ref>Swetnam, George (1980) ''Andrew Carnegie''. Twayne Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\nWhile Carnegie did not comment on British imperialism, he strongly opposed the idea of American colonies. He opposed the annexation of the Philippines almost to the point of supporting [[William Jennings Bryan]] against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/timeline/timeline2.html Andrew Carnegie timeline of events] PBS.</ref> However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]], in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] and literary figures like [[Mark Twain]].<ref>Hirschfeld, Katherine ''Health, Politics and Revolution in Cuba'', p. 117, Transaction Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0863-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Porter, Robert Percival |title=Industrial Cuba: Being a Study of Present Commercial and Industrial Conditions, with Suggestions as to the Opportunities Presented in the Island for American Capital, Enterprise, and Labour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2goAAAAYAAJ|year=1899|publisher=G.P.

From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in ''Triumphant Democracy'' (1886) and ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889). Carnegie bought [[Skibo Castle]] in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his [[Andrew Carnegie Mansion|New York mansion]] located at 2 East [[91st Street (Manhattan)|91st Street]] at [[Fifth Avenue]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The building was completed in late 1902, and he lived there until his death in 1919.

In total, Carnegie funded some 3,000 libraries, located in 47 US states, and also in Canada, Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the [[West Indies]], and [[Fiji]].

He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip,<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp. 56, 59</ref> and within a year was promoted to operator. Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night.<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 45</ref> Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a \"[[self-made man]]\" in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development.

Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed him as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|4.00|1853|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation). Carnegie accepted the job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience there than with the telegraph company.<ref name=\"Nasaw\"/> At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\">Edge (2004) p. 35.</ref> On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country.<ref>Edge (2004) p. 37</ref> As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year (${{Inflation|US|1500|1859|r=-3|fmt=c}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\"/> His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.<ref name=\"Nasaw\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 54\u201359, 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nScott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties \"as part of a [[quid pro quo]]\".<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 59\u201360.</ref> In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing of a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\"/><ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 79</ref> A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2.50"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1849"}, {"name": "r", "value": "0"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Murray"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Stuart A.P."}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Library: An Illustrated History"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[Skyhorse Pub.]]"}, {"name": "location", "value": "New York"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9781602397064"}]}, {"name": "Inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US"}, {"name": "2", "value": "4.00"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1853"}, {"name": "r", "value": "0"}]}, {"name": "Inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1500"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1859"}, {"name": "r", "value": "-3"}, {"name": "fmt", "value": "c"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "1860\u20131865: The Civil War", "paragraphs": "Before the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]], which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}.

The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.\n\nAfter the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several ironworks, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson.

Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.\n\n====1901: U.S. Steel====\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie, Vanity Fair, 1903-10-29.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Carnegie caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1903]]\nIn 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[Joint-stock company|joint stock corporation]]s as preparation for this. [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.\n\nThe buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.<ref name=\"Hawke 1980\"/>\n\nCarnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion \u2013 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Krass |first1=Peter |title=Carnegie |date=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons

Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (completed 1874).

He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[Joint-stock company|joint stock corporation]]s as preparation for this. [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.\n\nThe buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.<ref name=\"Hawke 1980\"/>\n\nCarnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion \u2013 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Krass |first1=Peter |title=Carnegie |date=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0471386308 |page=Chapter 29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwJ-UFP20mMC&pg=PT416&lpg=PT416&dq=carnegie+vault+for+us+steel+bonds&source=bl&ots=GqHK7rwNbo&sig=ACfU3U0BRm787CPhPNUnsx3xTwN0dX7KgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlob-8jZrmAhUjZN8KHVsWBvgQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=carnegie%20vault%20for%20us%20steel%20bonds&f=false |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Inflation-year", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US"}]}, {"name": "Formatprice", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}"}]}, {"name": "Inflation", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "US"}, {"name": "2", "value": "225639000"}, {"name": "3", "value": "1901"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Krass"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Peter"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Carnegie"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2002"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "John Wiley & Sons"}, {"name": "location", "value": "New York"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "0471386308"}, {"name": "page", "value": "Chapter 29"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=nwJ-UFP20mMC&pg=PT416&lpg=PT416&dq=carnegie+vault+for+us+steel+bonds&source=bl&ots=GqHK7rwNbo&sig=ACfU3U0BRm787CPhPNUnsx3xTwN0dX7KgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlob-8jZrmAhUjZN8KHVsWBvgQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=carnegie%20vault%20for%20us%20steel%20bonds&f=false"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "3 December 2019"}]}], "id": 7}, {"title": "Scholar and activist", "paragraphs": "====1880\u20131900====\nCarnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled.

He helped Washington create the [[National Negro Business League]].\n\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie, April 1905.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|April 1905]]\nIn 1904, he founded the [[Carnegie Hero Fund]] for the United States and Canada (a few years later also established in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Germany) for the recognition of deeds of heroism. Carnegie contributed $1,500,000 in 1903 for the erection of the [[Peace Palace]] at [[The Hague]]; and he donated $150,000 for a [[Pan-American Palace]] in Washington as a home for the International Bureau of American Republics.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nCarnegie was honored for his philanthropy and support of the arts by initiation as an honorary member of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] fraternity on October 14, 1917, at the [[New England Conservatory|New England Conservatory of Music]] in Boston, Massachusetts. The fraternity's mission reflects Carnegie's values by developing young men to share their talents to create harmony in the world.\n\nBy the standards of 19th century tycoons, Carnegie was not a particularly ruthless man but a humanitarian with enough acquisitiveness to go in the ruthless pursuit of money.<ref>Krause, Paul (1992).

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881.

Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of \"commercial murder\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system. Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies. Over the course of twenty years, Carnegie's steel properties grew to include the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, the Lucy Furnace Works, the Union Iron Mills, the Homestead Works, the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines among many other industry related assets.<ref>Morris, Charles R.

In particular, it appears Carnegie either misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented some of Spencer's principal arguments. Spencer remarked upon his first visit to Carnegie's steel mills in Pittsburgh, which Carnegie saw as the manifestation of Spencer's philosophy, \"Six months' residence here would justify suicide.\"<ref>Wall, Joseph Frazer (1989).

In his 1854 essay \"Manners and Fashion\", Spencer referred to public education as \"Old schemes\". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, \"political, religious, literary, philanthropic\", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its \"original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism\".<ref>Spencer, Herbert. 1854 (''Manners and Fashion'') ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 74639\u201374656).

Carnegie believed that the sons of prosperous businesspersons were rarely as talented as their fathers.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> By leaving large sums of money to their children, wealthy business leaders were wasting resources that could be used to benefit society. Most notably, Carnegie believed that the future leaders of society would rise from the ranks of the poor.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 682\u2013689.</ref> Carnegie strongly believed in this because he had risen from the bottom.

In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of [[Calvinism]], and religion as a whole, but reconciled with it later in his life. In his autobiography, Carnegie describes his family as moderate [[Presbyterian]] believers, writing that \"there was not one orthodox Presbyterian\" in his family; various members of his family having somewhat distanced themselves from Calvinism, some of them leaning more towards [[Swedenborgianism]]. Although, being a child, his family led vigorous theological and political disputes. His mother avoided the topic of religion. His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation, while, according to Carnegie, still remaining very religious on his own.\n\nWitnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]]</ref> Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, \"Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.\"<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 339</ref>\n\nLater in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member of [[Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church]], pastored from 1905 to 1926 by [[Social Gospel]] exponent [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], while his wife and daughter belonged to the [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/04/23/archives/bagpipe-tunes-at-carnegie-wedding-charm-of-bonnie-scotland-lent-to.html \"Bagpipe Tunes at Carnegie Wedding\"].

These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.<ref>Carnegie, ''An American Four-in-Hand in Britain'' (New York, 1883), pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nDespite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for the newly-established [[International Court of Arbitration]]'s [[Peace Palace]] \u2013 brainchild of Russian Tsar [[Nicolas II]].<ref name=\"MoscowTimes\">{{cite web |last1=Gay |first1=Mark H |title=The Hague Peace Palace Keeps Tsar's Vision Alive |url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html |website=The Moscow Times |accessdate=August 8, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808232924/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html |archivedate=August 8, 2016 |date=November 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.<ref>David S.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/985802 online]</ref> In 1913, at the dedication of the Peace Palace in The Hague, Carnegie predicted that the end of war was ''as certain to come, and come soon, as day follows night.''<ref>Cited in Bruno Tertrais \"The Demise of Ares: The End of War as We Know It?\" ''The Washington Quarterly'', 35/3, (2012): p. 17.\n</ref>\n\nIn 1914, on the eve of the First World War, Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union (CPU), a group of leaders in religion, academia, and politics. Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.\n\nDespite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.\n\n===US colonial expansion===\nOn the matter of [[American imperialism|American colonial expansion]], Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the [[Newlands Resolution|annexation of the Hawaiian islands]] or [[Puerto Rico]], but he opposed the [[Philippine\u2013American War|annexation of the Philippines]]. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence.<ref>Carnegie, ''Americanism Versus Imperialism'', esp. pp. 12\u201313</ref> This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.\n\nAfter he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British writer [[William T. Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:\n\n{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision.

Garden City, NY [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA376]</ref>}}\n\nCarnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.\n\nLike Stead, he believed that the United States and the [[British Empire]] would merge into one nation, telling him \"We are heading straight to the Re-United States\". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/406/mode/2up |title=The Americanization of the World |publisher=Horace Markley |author=Stead, W.T. |year=1901 |pages=406\u201312}}</ref> The creation of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the \"scientific\" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patterson, David S. |title=Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=114 |issue=5 |year=1970 |pages=371\u201383 |jstor=985802}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-0-8050-7518-2"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "978-1-57607-860-0"}]}, {"name": "citation ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Carnegie"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Andrew"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Gospel of Wealth and Other Timely Essays"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[The Century Company]]"}, {"name": "page", "value": "11"}, {"name": "place", "value": "New York"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1900"}, {"name": "quote", "value": "\"The growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large estates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a salutary change in public opinion.

Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies.

He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, \"political, religious, literary, philanthropic\", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand.

Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.\n\nDespite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Examining the American peace movement prior to World War I"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2017-04-06"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Gay"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Mark H"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Hague Peace Palace Keeps Tsar's Vision Alive"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html"}, {"name": "website", "value": "The Moscow Times"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "August 8, 2016"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160808232924/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "August 8, 2016"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 10, 2013"}]}], "id": 24}, {"title": "US colonial expansion", "paragraphs": "On the matter of [[American imperialism|American colonial expansion]], Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States.

Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:\n\n{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision.

(1932) ''The Life of Andrew Carnegie'', Vol.2, p. 337. Garden City, NY [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA376]</ref>}}\n\nCarnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.\n\nLike Stead, he believed that the United States and the [[British Empire]] would merge into one nation, telling him \"We are heading straight to the Re-United States\". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/406/mode/2up |title=The Americanization of the World |publisher=Horace Markley |author=Stead, W.T. |year=1901 |pages=406\u201312}}</ref> The creation of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the \"scientific\" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patterson, David S. |title=Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=114 |issue=5 |year=1970 |pages=371\u201383 |jstor=985802}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization.

Of this sum, $62,000,000 was allotted to the British Empire and $288,000,000 to the United States, for Carnegie, in the main, confined his benefactions to the English-speaking nations. His largest gifts were $125,000,000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (this same body also became his residuary legatee),  $60,000,000 to public library buildings, $20,000,000 to colleges (usually the smaller ones), $6,000,000 to church organs, $29,000,000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, $10,000,000 to Hero Funds, $10,000,000 to the Endowment for International Peace, $10,000,000 to the Scottish Universities Trust, $10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Trust, and $3,750,000 to the Dunfermline Trust.<ref>Burton J.

The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegie's name is that for public libraries. Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fund \u2013 among other reasons, because \"it came up my ain back\"; but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance. There was only one genuine remedy, he believed, for the ills that beset the human race, and that was enlightenment. \"Let there be light\" was the motto that, in the early days, he insisted on placing in all his library buildings.
