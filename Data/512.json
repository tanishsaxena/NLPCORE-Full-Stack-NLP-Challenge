Recent World Bank research shows that some countries can get caught in a \"fragility trap\", in which self-reinforcing factors prevent the poorest nations from emerging from low-level equilibrium in the long run.<ref name=\"worldbank2\">World Bank.[http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Feature%20Story/Stop_Conflict_Reduce_Fragility_End_Poverty.pdf \"Stop Conflict, Reduce Fragility and End Poverty: Doing Things Differently in Fragile and Conflict-affected Situations\"], 2013.</ref> Moreover, most of the reduction in extreme poverty over the past twenty years has taken place in countries that have not experienced a civil conflict or have had governing institutions with a strong capacity to actually govern. Thus, to end extreme poverty, it is also important to focus on the interrelated problems of fragility and conflict.\n\nUSAID defines fragility as a government's lack of both legitimacy (the perception the government is adequate at doing its job) and effectiveness (how good the government is at maintaining law and order, in an equitable manner). As fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state, these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality. Additionally, in countries with high levels of inequality (a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions), much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations. Additionally, if China and India are removed from the equation, up to 70% of the world's poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility. Some analysts project that extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in fragile, low-income states like Haiti, Yemen and the Central African Republic.<ref>Nancy Lindborg.[http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/02/to-end-extreme-poverty-tackle-fragility/ \"To End Extreme Poverty, Tackle Fragility\"], USAID. 13 February 2014.</ref> However, some academics, such as [[Andy Sumner]], say that extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in middle-income countries, creating a paradox where the world's poor don't actually live in the poorest countries.<ref>Andy Summer.[http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/1426481_file_Sumner_where_in_the_world_FINAL_0.pdf \"Where Will the World's Poor Live?

Armed conflict can have severe effects on economic growth for many reasons such as the destruction of assets, destruction of livelihoods, creation of unwanted mass migration, and diversion of public resources towards war.<ref name=\"pnaec864\"/> Significantly, a country that experienced major violence during 1981\u20132005 had extreme poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than a country with no violence. On average, each civil conflict will cost a country roughly 30 years of GDP growth.<ref name=\"worldbank2\"/> Therefore, a renewed commitment from the international community to address the deteriorating situation in highly fragile states is necessary to both prevent the mass loss of life, but to also prevent the vicious cycle of extreme poverty.\n\nPopulation trends and dynamics (e.g. population growth) can also have a large impact on prospects for poverty reduction.

In the report, the HLP wrote that:\n\n<blockquote> Ending extreme poverty is just the beginning, not the end. It is vital, but our vision must be broader: to start countries on the path of sustainable development \u2013 building on the foundations established by the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro12, and meeting a challenge that no country, developed or developing, has met so far. We recommend to the Secretary-General that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty once and for all, in the context of sustainable development.</blockquote>\n\nTherefore, the report determined that a central goal of the Post-Millennium Development agenda is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. However, the report also emphasized that the MDGs were not enough on their own, as they did not \"focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on development\u2026the importance to development of good governance and institution\u2026nor the need for inclusive growth...\" Consequently, there now exists synergy between the policy position papers put forward by the United States (through USAID), the World Bank and the UN itself in terms of viewing fragility and a lack of good governance as exacerbating extreme poverty. However, in a departure from the views of other organizations, the commission also proposed that the UN focus not only on extreme poverty (a line drawn at $1.25), but also on a higher target, such as $2.

Additionally, the WBG set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020.

Since the World Bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus, less poverty, the WBG seeks to support employment training initiatives, small business development programs and strong labor protection laws. However, since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable, the World Bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing field.<ref>World Bank.

Children who experience under-nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability. Thus, they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults. The WBG estimates that as much as 3% of GDP can be lost as a result of under-nutrition among the poorest nations. To combat undernutrition, the WBG has partnered with UNICEF and the WHO to ensure all small children are fully fed. The WBG also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining children's healthcare or ensuring school attendance.

In President Obama's 2013 [[State of the Union]] address, he declared, \"So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades...which is within our reach.\" In response to Obama's call to action, USAID has made ending extreme poverty central to its mission statement.<ref>USAID.

Additionally, the WBG set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020.

In President Obama's 2013 [[State of the Union]] address, he declared, \"So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades...which is within our reach.\" In response to Obama's call to action, USAID has made ending extreme poverty central to its mission statement.<ref>USAID.

By reaching out to its international partners, whether commercial or public, the US has leveraged over $14 billion in outside commitments after investing only US$7 billion of its own. To ensure that Power Africa reaches the region's poorest, the initiative engages in a transaction based approach to create systematic change.

FtF aims to reduce poverty and undernutrition each by 20 percent over five years. Because of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) and a variety of congruent actors, the incidence of AIDS and HIV, which used to ravage Africa, reduced in scope and intensity. Through PEPFAR, the United States has ensured over five million people have received life-saving antiviral drugs, a significant proportion of the eight million people receiving treatment in relatively poor nations.<ref>USAID.
