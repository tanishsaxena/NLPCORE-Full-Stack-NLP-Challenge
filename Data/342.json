He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] at the age of 44 in 1957, the second-youngest recipient in history.\n\nCamus was [[pied-noir|born in Algeria]] to French parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the [[University of Algiers]]. He was in Paris when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] during [[World War II]]. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the [[French Resistance]] where he served as editor-in-chief at ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active. He was part of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] that opposed the [[Soviet Union]] because of its [[totalitarianism]]. Camus was a [[Moralism|moralist]] and leaned towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the [[Algerian War]], he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.\n\nPhilosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He is also considered to be an [[existentialist]], even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "French author and journalist"}]}, {"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2019"}]}, {"name": "use British English", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "June 2019"}]}, {"name": "Infobox philosopher\n", "values": [{"name": "image", "value": "Albert Camus, gagnant de prix Nobel, portrait en buste, pos\u00e9 au bureau, faisant face \u00e0 gauche, cigarette de tabagisme.jpg"}, {"name": "caption", "value": "Portrait from ''[[New York World-Telegram]] and Sun Photograph Collection'', 1957"}, {"name": "region", "value": "[[Western philosophy]]"}, {"name": "era", "value": "[[20th-century philosophy]]"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{birth date|1913|11|7|df=yes}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), [[French Algeria]]"}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{death date and age|df=yes|1960|1|4|1913|11|7}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Villeblevin]], France"}, {"name": "death_cause", "value": "[[Car accident]]"}, {"name": "alma_mater", "value": "[[University of Algiers]]"}, {"name": "notable_works", "value": "''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' / ''The Outsider''<br/>''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''<br/>''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''<br/>''[[The Plague]]''"}, {"name": "signature", "value": "Albert Camus signature.svg"}, {"name": "signature_size", "value": "150px"}, {"name": "signature_alt", "value": "Albert Camus signature"}, {"name": "school_tradition", "value": "[[Continental philosophy]]<br/>[[Absurdism]]<br/>[[Existentialism]]<br/>[[Anarchism]]<br/>[[Syndicalism]]"}, {"name": "main_interests", "value": "[[Ethics]], [[Human nature|humanity]], [[justice]], [[politics]], [[suicide]]"}, {"name": "influences", "value": "[[Sartre]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Augustine]], [[Homer]], [[Lev Shestov|Shestov]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Jean Grenier|Grenier]], [[Samuel Beckett]]"}, {"name": "influenced", "value": "[[Michel Onfray]]"}, {"name": "notable_ideas", "value": "[[Absurdism]]"}, {"name": "module", "value": "{{infobox person\n| embed = yes\n| partner = [[Francine Faure]]\n| children = [[Catherine Camus|Catherine]], and a son}}"}]}, {"name": "birth date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1913"}, {"name": "2", "value": "11"}, {"name": "3", "value": "7"}, {"name": "df", "value": "yes"}]}, {"name": "death date and age", "values": [{"name": "df", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "1", "value": "1960"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1"}, {"name": "3", "value": "4"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1913"}, {"name": "5", "value": "11"}, {"name": "6", "value": "7"}]}, {"name": "infobox person\n", "values": [{"name": "embed", "value": "yes"}, {"name": "partner", "value": "[[Francine Faure]]"}, {"name": "children", "value": "[[Catherine Camus|Catherine]], and a son"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "k"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u00e6"}, {"name": "3", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "4", "value": "m"}, {"name": "5", "value": "u\u02d0"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "also"}, {"name": "2", "value": "US"}, {"name": "3", "value": "k"}, {"name": "4", "value": "\u0259"}, {"name": "5", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "6", "value": "m"}, {"name": "7", "value": "u\u02d0"}]}, {"name": "IPA-fr", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "alb\u025b\u0281 kamy"}, {"name": "2", "value": "lang"}, {"name": "3", "value": "Fr-Albert Camus.oga"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Life", "paragraphs": "\n===Early years and education===\n\n[[File:Algiers The University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighbourhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sint\u00e8s Camus, was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-([[Balearic Islands|Balearic]]) descent. His father, Lucien Camus, a poor French-Algerian agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus never knew him. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. He was a second-generation French immigrant to Algeria. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Africa for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French who were born in Algeria\u2014and his binational identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen, in contrast to the [[Arab]] or [[Berbers|Berberic]] inhabitants of Algeria who were denied the associated privileges this brought.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, Camus developed a love for soccer and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}}\n\n===Young Camus===\nIn 1934, aged 20, Camus was in a relationship with a drug addict named Simone Hi\u00e9.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1986|1p=30|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|p=9}} She was addicted to [[morphine]], a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hi\u00e9 to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}} Camus was a womanizer throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=13}}\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]] and had not read ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital''). He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|1p=12|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===World War II, Resistance and ''Combat''===\n\nSoon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of [[World War II]] began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from ''Paris-Soir'' and ended up in [[Lyon]], where he married pianist and mathematician [[Francine Faure]] on 3 December 1940.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=13\u201314}} Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria ([[Oran]]) where he taught in primary schools.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=13}} Because of his tuberculosis, he was forced to move to the French Alps. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt\u2014a novel ''La Peste'' (''[[The Plague]]'') and a play ''Le Malentendu'' (''[[The Misunderstanding]]''). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and others. Among them was the actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], who would later have an affair with Camus.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}}\n\nCamus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the [[Occupation of France|French Occupation]]. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}} Camus used a pseudonym for his ''Combat'' articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death|Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand]]'' (''Letters to a German Friend''), explaining why resistance was necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=15}}\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Albert Camus2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Albert Camus in the 1950s|Albert Camus in the 1950s]]\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nAfter the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean in 1945.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the novel ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''). Camus attacked [[totalitarian]] [[communism]] while advocating [[libertarian]] [[socialism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=17}} Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the [[Algerian War]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nCamus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organisations working towards that end.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1944, he founded the Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais pour la f\u00e9deration europ\u00e9enne\u2014(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))\u2014declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1947\u201348, he founded the Groupes de liaison internationale (GLI){{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Schaffner|2y=2006|2p=107}} a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary [[syndicalism]] (\"syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire\"). According to Olivier Todd's biography ''Albert Camus, une vie'', (''Albert Camus: A Life'') it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the [[Surrealist Manifesto|Surrealist movement]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. His colleagues were [[Nicolas Lazar\u00e9vitch]], [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, and [[Jean de Bo\u00eb]].{{sfn|Boulouque|2000}} His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the [[Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet intervention in Hungary]] and the totalitarian tendencies of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime in Spain.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}}\n\nCamus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress Mar\u00eda Casares, with whom he had an extensive correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=14\u201317|2a1=Zaretsky|2y=2018}} Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalisation in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}}\n\nIn 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography ''[[The First Man|Le Premier Homme]]'' (''The First Man'') in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}} Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The play opened in January 1959 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Antoine Theatre]] in Paris and was a critical success.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=18}}\n\n===Camus' death ===\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Camus's gravestone| Albert Camus's gravestone]] [[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

He had spent the New Year's holiday of 1960 at his house in [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]] with his family, and his publisher [[Michel Gallimard]] of [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]], along with his wife, Janine, and daughter. Camus's wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2nd January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard's luxurious [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]]. The car crashed into a [[Platanus|plane tree]] on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the [[Route nationale 6|RN 6]]). Camus, who was in the passenger seat and not wearing a safety belt, died instantly.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Life}} Gallimard died a few days later, although his wife and daughter were unharmed.

University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighbourhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sint\u00e8s Camus, was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-([[Balearic Islands|Balearic]]) descent. His father, Lucien Camus, a poor French-Algerian agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus never knew him. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. He was a second-generation French immigrant to Algeria. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Africa for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French who were born in Algeria\u2014and his binational identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen, in contrast to the [[Arab]] or [[Berbers|Berberic]] inhabitants of Algeria who were denied the associated privileges this brought.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, Camus developed a love for soccer and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity.

He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]] and had not read ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital''). He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''.

By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the novel ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'').

This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42.

The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, ''L'Envers et l'Endroit'' (''[[Betwixt and Between]]'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side''). Both were published by [[Edmond Charlot]]'s small publishing house.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=11}}\n \nCamus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ''L'\u00c9tranger'', ''Le Mythe de Sysiphe'', and ''Caligula''. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included ''La Peste'' (''The Plague''), ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel''), and ''Les Justes'' (''The Just Assassins''). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of ''Nemesis''. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs. {{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp=41\u201344}}\n\nThe books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=23}} With this cycle, Camus aims to pose a question on the [[human condition]], discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=41}}\n\nCamus began his work on the second cycle while he was in [[Algeria]], in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=14}} In the second cycle, Camus used [[Prometheus]], who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, its connection to politics, and examines it under the lens of modernity, of [[historicity]] and the absence of a God.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at ''Actuelles III: Chronique alg\u00e9rienne 1939\u20131958'' (''Algerian Chronicles''). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess [[Nemesis]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}}\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first entitled ''La mort heureuse'' (''[[A Happy Death]]'') (1970), features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''The Stranger''{{'}}s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''Le Premier homme'' (''The First Man'') (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria.\n\nThe publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus's allegedly unrepentant colonialism.{{sfn|Carroll|2007}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Works of Camus by genre and cycle, <small>according to Matthew Sharpe{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=44}}</small>\n|-\n!

For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=141-143}} His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus's most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the [[Blum\u2013Viollette proposal]] to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=145}} In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands. He advocated for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=356}}\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions, and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the \"new [[Arab imperialism]]\" led by Egypt, and an \"anti-Western\" offensive orchestrated by Russia to \"encircle Europe\" and \"isolate the United States\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=322}} Although favouring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist.
