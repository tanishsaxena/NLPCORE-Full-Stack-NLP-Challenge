The [[type species]], ''A. sarcophagus'', was apparently restricted in [[range (biology)|range]] to the modern-day [[Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]], after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing ''[[Gorgosaurus libratus]]'' as a second species.\n\nAs a tyrannosaurid, ''Albertosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predator]] with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the [[food chain]] in its local [[ecosystem]]. While ''Albertosaurus'' was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than 2 metric tons.\n\nSince the first discovery in 1884, [[fossil]]s of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of ''Albertosaurus'' anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of [[pack hunter|pack]] behaviour and allows studies of [[ontogeny]] and [[population biology]], which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Genus of bipedal predatory dinosaur"}]}, {"name": "Speciesbox\n", "values": [{"name": "fossil_range", "value": "[[Late Cretaceous]], {{fossil range|71|68|earliest=75}}<small>Possible [[Campanian]] record</small>"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Albertosaurus Clean.png"}, {"name": "image_caption", "value": "Cast in the [[Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center]] in Woodland Park, Colorado"}, {"name": "display_parents", "value": "2"}, {"name": "genus", "value": "Albertosaurus"}, {"name": "parent_authority", "value": "[[Henry Fairfield Osborn|Osborn]], 1905"}, {"name": "species", "value": "sarcophagus"}, {"name": "authority", "value": "Osborn, 1905"}, {"name": "synonyms", "value": "'''''[[Deinodon]] sarcophagus''''' <small>(Osborn, 1905)</small><br />\n'''''Albertosaurus arctunguis''''' <small>Parks, 1928</small><br />\n'''''Deinodon arctunguis''''' <small>(Parks, 1928)</small>"}]}, {"name": "fossil range", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "71"}, {"name": "2", "value": "68"}, {"name": "earliest", "value": "75"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u00e6"}, {"name": "2", "value": "l"}, {"name": "3", "value": "\u02cc"}, {"name": "4", "value": "b"}, {"name": "5", "value": "\u025c\u02d0r"}, {"name": "6", "value": "t"}, {"name": "7", "value": "\u0259"}, {"name": "8", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "9", "value": "s"}, {"name": "10", "value": "\u0254\u02d0r"}, {"name": "11", "value": "\u0259"}, {"name": "12", "value": "s"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Description", "paragraphs": "[[File:Albertoscale.svg|thumb|left|Size comparison]]\n''Albertosaurus'' was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' and ''Tyrannosaurus''.

The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of ''D. aquilunguis'', type species of ''Dryptosaurus'', so Osborn created the new name ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' for them in 1905.

However, in 2010, [[Thomas Carr (paleontologist)|Thomas Carr]] established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or [[autapomorphy]]: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the [[palatine bone]], proving that ''Albertosaurus'' was a valid [[taxon]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Thomas D. | year = 2010 | title = A taxonomic assessment of the type series of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' and the identity of Tyrannosauridae (Dinosauria, Coelurosauria) in the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian\u2013Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1213\u20131226 | doi = 10.1139/e10-035 }}</ref>\n\n===Dry Island bonebed===\n[[File:Albertosaurus teeth - Royal Tyrrell Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Teeth from Dry Island and Drumheller, [[Royal Tyrrell Museum]]]] \nOn 11 August 1910, American paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] discovered the remains of a large group of ''Albertosaurus'' at another [[quarry]] alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the [[bonebed]]. Among the bones deposited in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] collections in [[New York City]] are seven sets of right [[metatarsal]]s, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. Palaeontologist [[Philip J.

Finding, largely due to a lack of good ''Albertosaurus'' skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, [[Dale Russell]] declared the name ''Gorgosaurus'' a [[junior synonym]] of ''Albertosaurus'', which had been named first, and ''G. libratus'' was renamed ''Albertosaurus libratus'' in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus ''Albertosaurus'' backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.<ref name=russell1970/>\n\nIn 2003, [[Philip J. Currie]], benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are [[sister taxa]], more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than ''Daspletosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from [[Alaska]] and [[New Mexico]], and Currie suggested that the ''Albertosaurus''-''Gorgosaurus'' situation may be clarified once these are described fully.<ref name=currie2003b/> Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation,<ref name=holtz2004/><ref name=ericksonetal2004/><ref name=ricklefs2007>{{cite_journal |last=Ricklefs |first=Robert E. |year=2007 |title=Tyrannosaur ageing |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=214\u2013217 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597 |pmid=17284406 |pmc=2375931}}</ref> but some have not.<ref name=carretal2005/>\n\n===Other species===\nApart from ''A. sarcophagus'', ''A. arctunguis'' and ''A. libratus'', several other species of ''Albertosaurus'' have been named.

The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of ''D. aquilunguis'', type species of ''Dryptosaurus'', so Osborn created the new name ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' for them in 1905.

However, in 2010, [[Thomas Carr (paleontologist)|Thomas Carr]] established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or [[autapomorphy]]: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the [[palatine bone]], proving that ''Albertosaurus'' was a valid [[taxon]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Thomas D. | year = 2010 | title = A taxonomic assessment of the type series of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' and the identity of Tyrannosauridae (Dinosauria, Coelurosauria) in the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian\u2013Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1213\u20131226 | doi = 10.1139/e10-035 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Tanke"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Darren H."}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Currie"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Philip J."}, {"name": "year", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A history of ''Albertosaurus'' discoveries in Alberta, Canada"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "47"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "9"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1197\u20131211"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1139/e10-057"}]}, {"name": "cite_journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Cope"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Edward D."}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Edward Drinker Cope"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1892"}, {"name": "title", "value": "On the skull of the dinosaurian ''Laelaps incrassatus'' Cope"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "American Philosophical Society, Proceedings"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "30"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "240\u2013245"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Lambe"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "L.M."}, {"name": "year", "value": "1903"}, {"name": "title", "value": "On the lower jaw of ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' (Cope)"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Ottawa Naturalist"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "17"}, {"name": "page", "value": "134"}]}, {"name": "cite_journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Lambe"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Lawrence M."}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Lawrence Lambe"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1904"}, {"name": "title", "value": "On ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' (Cope) from the Edmonton Series of the Northwest Territory"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Contributions to Canadian Palaeontology"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "3"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1\u201327"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://archive.org/details/LambeL.M.1904.OnDryptosaurusIncrassatuscopeFromTheEdmonton"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2010-08-29"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Carr"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Thomas D."}, {"name": "year", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A taxonomic assessment of the type series of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' and the identity of Tyrannosauridae (Dinosauria, Coelurosauria) in the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian\u2013Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "47"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "9"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1213\u20131226"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1139/e10-035"}]}], "id": 5}, {"title": "Dry Island bonebed", "paragraphs": "[[File:Albertosaurus teeth - Royal Tyrrell Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Teeth from Dry Island and Drumheller, [[Royal Tyrrell Museum]]]] \nOn 11 August 1910, American paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] discovered the remains of a large group of ''Albertosaurus'' at another [[quarry]] alongside the Red Deer River.

Finding, largely due to a lack of good ''Albertosaurus'' skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, [[Dale Russell]] declared the name ''Gorgosaurus'' a [[junior synonym]] of ''Albertosaurus'', which had been named first, and ''G. libratus'' was renamed ''Albertosaurus libratus'' in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus ''Albertosaurus'' backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.<ref name=russell1970/>\n\nIn 2003, [[Philip J. Currie]], benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are [[sister taxa]], more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than ''Daspletosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from [[Alaska]] and [[New Mexico]], and Currie suggested that the ''Albertosaurus''-''Gorgosaurus'' situation may be clarified once these are described fully.<ref name=currie2003b/> Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation,<ref name=holtz2004/><ref name=ericksonetal2004/><ref name=ricklefs2007>{{cite_journal |last=Ricklefs |first=Robert E. |year=2007 |title=Tyrannosaur ageing |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=214\u2013217 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597 |pmid=17284406 |pmc=2375931}}</ref> but some have not.<ref name=carretal2005/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite_journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Lambe"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Lawrence M."}, {"name": "authorlink", "value": "Lawrence Lambe"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1914"}, {"name": "title", "value": "On a new genus and species of carnivorous dinosaur from the Belly River Formation of Alberta, with a description of the skull of ''Stephanosaurus marginatus'' from the same horizon"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Ottawa Naturalist"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "28"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "13\u201320"}]}, {"name": "cite_journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Ricklefs"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Robert E."}, {"name": "year", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Tyrannosaur ageing"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Biology Letters"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "3"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "2"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "214\u2013217"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597"}, {"name": "pmid", "value": "17284406"}, {"name": "pmc", "value": "2375931"}]}], "id": 8}, {"title": "Other species", "paragraphs": "Apart from ''A. sarcophagus'', ''A. arctunguis'' and ''A. libratus'', several other species of ''Albertosaurus'' have been named.

Using bone [[histology]], the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known ''Albertosaurus'' is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) and measured slightly more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} in length. The {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an ''S''-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was {{convert|122|kg|lb|abbr=off}} per year, based on an adult 1.3&nbsp;[[tonne]]s.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of [[Biological life cycle|life history]], rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile ''Albertosaurus'' are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/>\n\nA hypothesis of ''Albertosaurus'' life history postulates that [[hatchling]]s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult ''Albertosaurus'', and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of [[senescence]]. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, [[African buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all ''Albertosaurus'' specimens are known from one locality.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=ricklefs2007/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Gregory M. | last2 = Currie | first2 = Philip J. | last3 = Inouye | first3 = Brian D. | last4 = Winn | first4 = Alice A. | year = 2010 | title = A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1269\u20131275 | doi = 10.1139/e10-051 }}</ref>\n\n===Pack behaviour===\n[[Image:Albertosaurus Tyrrell.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze sculptures of a pack, RTM, designed by Brian Cooley in 2007]]\nThe Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 ''Albertosaurus'', the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' assemblage at the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Utah]]. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/>\n\nThe near-absence of [[herbivore]] remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[California]], and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time.

The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of [[ornithomimid]]s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger ''Albertosaurus'' were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower.<ref name=currie1998/> Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator [[Ecological niche|niche]]s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than adult ''Albertosaurus'' in mass.<ref name=holtz2004/> A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small [[insectivore]]s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands.<ref name=auffenberg1981>{{cite_book |last=Auffenberg |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Auffenberg|year=2000 |title=The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=978-0-8130-0621-5}}</ref> However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested.

Using bone [[histology]], the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species.

The {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an ''S''-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was {{convert|122|kg|lb|abbr=off}} per year, based on an adult 1.3&nbsp;[[tonne]]s.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of [[Biological life cycle|life history]], rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile ''Albertosaurus'' are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/>\n\nA hypothesis of ''Albertosaurus'' life history postulates that [[hatchling]]s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult ''Albertosaurus'', and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of [[senescence]]. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, [[African buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all ''Albertosaurus'' specimens are known from one locality.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=ricklefs2007/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Gregory M. | last2 = Currie | first2 = Philip J. | last3 = Inouye | first3 = Brian D. | last4 = Winn | first4 = Alice A. | year = 2010 | title = A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1269\u20131275 | doi = 10.1139/e10-051 }}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite_journal ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Roach"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Brian T."}, {"name": "author2", "value": "Brinkman, Daniel T."}, {"name": "year", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "48"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "1"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "103\u2013138"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Erickson"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Gregory M."}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Currie"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Philip J."}, {"name": "last3", "value": "Inouye"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Brian D."}, {"name": "last4", "value": "Winn"}, {"name": "first4", "value": "Alice A."}, {"name": "year", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "title", "value": "A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences"}, {"name": "volume", "value": "47"}, {"name": "issue", "value": "9"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "1269\u20131275"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.1139/e10-051"}]}], "id": 13}, {"title": "Pack behaviour", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Albertosaurus Tyrrell.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze sculptures of a pack, RTM, designed by Brian Cooley in 2007]]\nThe Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 ''Albertosaurus'', the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' assemblage at the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Utah]].

Along with much rarer [[ankylosauria]]ns and [[pachycephalosaur]]s, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including [[troodontid]]s, [[dromaeosaurid]]s, and [[caenagnathid]]s.<ref name=eberth1997/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = Derek W. | last2 = Brinkman | first2 = Donald B. | last3 = Bell | first3 = Phil R. | year = 2010 | title = Faunal assemblages from the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation, an early Maastrichtian cool-climate assemblage from Alberta, with special reference to the ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' bonebed | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1159\u20131181 | doi = 10.1139/e10-005 }}</ref> Intermingled with the ''Albertosaurus'' remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod ''[[Albertonykus]]'' were found.<ref name=LC08>{{cite journal |last=Longrich |first=Nicholas R. |author2=Currie, Philip J. |year=2009 |title=''Albertonykus borealis'', a new alvarezsaur (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Maastrichtian of Alberta, Canada: Implications for the systematics and ecology of the Alvarezsauridae |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages= 239\u2013252|doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2008.07.005 }}</ref> Adult ''Albertosaurus'' were the [[apex predator]]s in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.<ref name=eberth1997/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite_book ", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Eberth"}, {"name": "first", "value": "David A."}, {"name": "year", "value": "1997"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "Edmonton Group"}, {"name": "editor", "value": "[[Philip J.
