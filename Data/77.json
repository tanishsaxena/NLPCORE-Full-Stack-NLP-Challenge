Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.\n\nThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.<ref name=\"Time n.d.\"/>  This combined time scale is published monthly in \"Circular T\",<ref name=\"Circular T\"/> and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC \u2212 UTC(''k'') (equivalent to TAI \u2212 TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  The same circular also gives tables of TAI \u2212 TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.\n\nErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://iag.dgfi.tum.de/fileadmin/IAG-docs/Travaux2013/08_BIPM.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)  Time Department"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Report of the International Association of Geodesy 2011-2013"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "11 April 2017"}]}, {"name": "cite web \n", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Time"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "International Bureau of Weights and Measures"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "22 May 2013"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "McCarthy"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Seidelmann"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "p", "value": "207, 214"}]}, {"name": "citation ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Circular T"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]"}, {"name": "url", "value": "ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2017-09-05"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "Early atomic time scales consisted of [[quartz clock]]s with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously.

It was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and to establish a time scale, called Greenwich Atomic (GA). The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956, using an [[Atomichron]] commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Boulder, Colorado]] on 9 October 1957.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=199\u2013200}}\n\nThe [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T<sub>m</sub> or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals.

From 1971 to 1975 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time (TAI).{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=203\u2013204}} \n\nIn the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the [[geoid]]).  Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=215}}\n\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brumberg|first1=V.A.|last2=Kopeikin|first2=S.M.|title=Relativistic time scales in the solar system|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]]|issn=0923-2958|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23\u201344|date=March 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00050674|bibcode=1990CeMDA..48...23B}}</ref>  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.{{efn|The 32.184 second offset is to provide continuity with the older [[ephemeris time]].}} TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&nbsp;s.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=218&ndash;219}}\n\nThe continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated, \"In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |title=CCTF 09-27 \n |url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf \n |date=3 September 2007 \n |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures \n |access-date=24 September 2016 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100907/http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf \n |archive-date=16 March 2012 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "McCarthy"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Seidelmann"}, {"name": "3", "value": "2009"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "199\u2013200"}]}, {"name": "efn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "They were set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant.
