The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]], located in the [[Earth]]'s [[southern hemisphere]], is centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]]. It is washed by the [[Southern Ocean|Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean]] or, depending on definition, the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s. It has an area of more than 14 million&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nSome 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], the world's largest [[ice sheet]] and also its largest reservoir of [[fresh water]]. Averaging at least 1.6&nbsp;km thick, the ice is so massive that it has [[post-glacial rebound|depressed the continental bedrock]] in some areas more than 2.5&nbsp;km below sea level; [[Subglacial lake|subglacial lakes]] of liquid water also occur (e.g., [[Lake Vostok]]).

''Earth-Science Reviews'', 74, 241-268.</ref> It defines a special field of volcanic that is specifically centered around ice and ice melt. This field of science is less than 100 years old, and thus continuously makes new discoveries. Glaciovolcanism is characterized by three kinds of eruptions: [[Subglacial eruption|sub-glacial eruptions,]] supraglacial volcanism, and ice-marginal volcanism.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/what-is-glaciovolcanism.html|title=What is Glaciovolcanism?|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe study of glaciovolcanism is vital to the understanding of ice sheet formation. It is also a valuable tool to predict volcanic hazards, such as the ash hazard following the [[Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull]] eruption in Iceland.\n\n==== Marie Byrd Land ====\nThe [[Marie Byrd Land]] is an incredibly large portion of West Antarctica, consisting of the Area below the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The Marie Byrd land is a large formation of volcanic rock, characterized by 18 exposed and subglacial volcanoes. 16 of the 18 volcanoes are entirely covered by the antarctic ice sheet.<ref name=\":1\">Winberry, J.

Scientists remain uncertain about the presence of water underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with some claiming to have found evidence indicating the existence.\n\n==== Conditions of Formation ====\nIn West Antarctica's Marie Byrd Land, volcanoes are typically composed of alkaline and basaltic lava. Sometimes, the volcanoes are entirely basaltic in composition. Due to the geographic similarity of the Marie Byrd Land, it is believed that the volcanoes in the West African Rift System are also composed of basalt.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hein|first=Andrew S.|last2=Bingham|first2=Robert G.|last3=Vries|first3=Maximillian van Wyk de|date=2018-01-01|title=A new volcanic province: an inventory of subglacial volcanoes in West Antarctica|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/461/1/231|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=461|issue=1|pages=231\u2013248|doi=10.1144/SP461.7|issn=0305-8719}}</ref>\n\nAbove-ice basaltic volcanoes, also known as subaerial basaltic volcanoes, generally form in tall, broad cone shapes.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Hein|first=Andrew S.|last2=Bingham|first2=Robert G.|last3=Vries|first3=Maximillian van Wyk de|date=2018-01-01|title=A new volcanic province: an inventory of subglacial volcanoes in West Antarctica|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/461/1/231|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=461|issue=1|pages=231\u2013248|doi=10.1144/SP461.7|issn=0305-8719}}</ref> Since they are formed from repeated piling of liquid magma sourced from the center, they spread widely and grow upwards relatively slowly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/book/export/html/198|title=Types of Volcanoes|website=volcano.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> However, West Antarctic Volcanoes form underneath ice sheets, and are thus categorized as subglacial volcanoes. Subglacial volcanoes that are [[Monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic]] are far more narrow, steeper, flat topped structures. [[Polygenetic volcanic field|Polygenetic]] subglacial volcanoes have a wider variety of shapes and sizes due to being made up of many different eruptions. Often, they look more cone shaped, like [[Stratovolcano|statovolcanoes]].\n\n=== Hazards ===\n\n===== Hazardous Ash =====\nLittle has been studied about the implications of volcanic ash from eruptions within the Antarctic Circle. It is likely that an eruption at lower latitudes would cause global health and aviation hazards due to ash disbursement. The clockwise air circulation around the low pressure system at the South Pole forces air upwards, hypothetically sending ash upwards towards the Stratospheric jet streams, and thus quickly dispersing it throughout the globe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Geyer|first=Adelina|last2=Marti|first2=Alejandro|last3=Folch|first3=A.|last4=Giralt|first4=Santiago|date=2017-04-23|title=Antarctic volcanoes: A remote but significant hazard|hdl=10261/162118|doi=10.13039/501100003329|arxiv=1502.05188}}</ref>\n\n==== Melting Ice ====\nRecently, in 2017, a study found evidence of subglacial volcanic activity within the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
