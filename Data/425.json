In amplitude modulation, the [[amplitude]] (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal being transmitted.  The message signal is, for example, a function of the sound to be reproduced by a [[loudspeaker]], or the light intensity of pixels of a television screen.  This technique contrasts with [[frequency modulation]], in which the [[frequency]] of the [[carrier signal]] is varied, and [[phase modulation]], in which its [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is varied.\n\nAM was the earliest modulation method used for transmitting audio in radio broadcasting. It was developed during the first quarter of the 20th century beginning with [[Roberto Landell de Moura]] and [[Reginald Fessenden]]'s [[radiotelephone]] experiments in 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aminharadio.com/radio/files/Artigo-Revista-PCP-USA.pdf|format=PDF|title=Father Landell de Moura : Radio Broadcasting Pioneer : FABIO S.

In this sense, the carrier wave, which has a much higher frequency than the message signal, ''carries'' the information.  At the receiving station, the message signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by [[demodulation]].\n\nIn amplitude modulation, the [[amplitude]] or ''strength'' of the carrier oscillations is varied. For example, in AM radio communication, a [[continuous wave]] radio-frequency signal (a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[carrier wave]]) has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission. The audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the ''[[Envelope (waves)|envelope]]'' of the waveform. In the [[frequency domain]], amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the [[carrier frequency]] and two adjacent [[sideband]]s. Each sideband is equal in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to that of the modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other. Standard AM is thus sometimes called \"double-sideband amplitude modulation\" (DSB-AM) to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on AM.\n\nA disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques, not only standard AM, is that the receiver amplifies and detects [[Noise (radio)|noise]] and [[electromagnetic interference]] in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received [[signal-to-noise ratio]], say, by a factor of 10 (a 10 [[decibel]] improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to [[frequency modulation]] (FM) and [[digital radio]] where the effect of such noise following [[demodulation]] is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and [[high fidelity]] broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, [[talk radio]] etc.).\n\nAM is also inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal.  The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using [[envelope detector|envelope detection]], providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the [[intermediate frequency]]) from a greatly reduced \"pilot\" carrier (in [[reduced-carrier transmission]] or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]], carrier regeneration is possible using a [[Costas loop|Costas phase-locked loop]]. This doesn't work however for [[single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]] (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic \"Donald Duck\" sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in [[amateur radio]] and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]] broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.\n\nAn additional function provided by the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the [[automatic gain control]] (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is ''no'' transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called ''fast attack, slow decay'' circuit which holds the AGC level for a second or more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.\n\nA trivial form of AM which can be used for transmitting [[Digital data|binary data]] is [[on-off keying]], the simplest form of ''[[amplitude-shift keying]]'', in which [[Binary numeral system|ones and zeros]] are represented by the presence or absence of a carrier. On-off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit [[Morse code]] where it is known as [[continuous wave]] (CW) operation, even though the transmission is not strictly \"continuous.\"  A more complex form of AM, [[QAM|quadrature amplitude modulation]] is now more commonly used with digital data, while making more efficient use of the available bandwidth.\n\n===ITU designations===\nIn 1982, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) designated the types of amplitude modulation:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Designation!!Description\n|-\n|A3E||[[double sideband|double-sideband]] a full-carrier - the basic amplitude modulation scheme\n|-\n|R3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] [[Reduced-carrier transmission|reduced-carrier]]\n|-\n|H3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] full-carrier\n|-\n|J3E||[[Single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|single-sideband suppressed-carrier]]\n|-\n|B8E||[[independent sideband|independent-sideband]] emission\n|-\n|C3F||[[vestigal sideband|vestigial-sideband]]\n|-\n|Lincompex||linked [[compander|compressor and expander]] (a submode of any of the above ITU Emission Modes)\n|}<!--single mid band linked modulation\n[B4E side bander inter linked] [expand carrier] full reduced.aLTIDOE-->\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "refimprove section", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "February 2015"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "ITU designations", "paragraphs": "In 1982, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) designated the types of amplitude modulation:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Designation!!Description\n|-\n|A3E||[[double sideband|double-sideband]] a full-carrier - the basic amplitude modulation scheme\n|-\n|R3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] [[Reduced-carrier transmission|reduced-carrier]]\n|-\n|H3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] full-carrier\n|-\n|J3E||[[Single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|single-sideband suppressed-carrier]]\n|-\n|B8E||[[independent sideband|independent-sideband]] emission\n|-\n|C3F||[[vestigal sideband|vestigial-sideband]]\n|-\n|Lincompex||linked [[compander|compressor and expander]] (a submode of any of the above ITU Emission Modes)\n|}<!--single mid band linked modulation\n[B4E side bander inter linked] [expand carrier] full reduced.aLTIDOE-->\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "History", "paragraphs": "[[Image:Telefunken arc radiotelephone.jpg|thumb|One of the crude pre-vacuum tube AM transmitters, a Telefunken [[arc converter|arc transmitter]] from 1906.

They couldn't transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of [[damped wave]]s, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, that sounded like a buzz in receivers.

If ''m'' < 1, ''(1 + m(t)/A)'' is always positive for undermodulation. If ''m'' > 1 then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal. Amplitude modulation results when the carrier ''c(t)'' is multiplied by the positive quantity  ''(1 + m(t)/A)'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  y(t) &= \\left[1 + \\frac{m(t)}{A}\\right] c(t) \\\\\n       &= \\left[1 + m \\cos\\left(2\\pi f_m t + \\phi\\right)\\right] A \\sin\\left(2\\pi f_c t\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this simple case ''m'' is identical to the [[#Modulation index|modulation index]], discussed below.

However, by the principle of [[Fourier decomposition]], ''m(t)'' can be expressed as the sum of a set of sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of  ''1 + m(t)'' with ''c(t)'' as above, the result consists of a sum of sine waves. Again, the carrier ''c(t)'' is present unchanged, but each frequency component of ''m'' at ''f<sub>i</sub>'' has two sidebands at frequencies ''f<sub>c</sub> + f<sub>i</sub>'' and  ''f<sub>c</sub> - f<sub>i</sub>''. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband.  The modulation ''m(t)'' may be considered to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components, as shown in the top of Fig. 2. One can view the sidebands as that modulation ''m(t)'' having simply been shifted in frequency by ''f<sub>c</sub>'' as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2.\n\n[[File:AM signal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fig 3: The [[spectrogram]] of an AM voice broadcast shows the two sidebands (green) on either side of the carrier (red) with time proceeding in the vertical direction.|alt=Sonogram of an AM signal, showing the carrier and both sidebands vertically]]\nThe short-term spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, the frequency content (horizontal axis) may be plotted as a function of time (vertical axis), as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, an upper sideband is generated according to those frequencies shifted ''above'' the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 9}, {"title": "Power and spectrum efficiency", "paragraphs": "The RF bandwidth of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, but only considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or \"[[baseband]]\") signal, since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using [[frequency modulation]] (FM), it is twice as wide as [[single-sideband]] techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or \"channels\") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as [[vestigial sideband]], somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) in order to reduce the required channel spacing.\n\nAnother improvement over standard AM is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus there is a great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband ([[single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]]) or with both sidebands remaining ([[double sideband suppressed carrier]]). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing [[Product detector|synchronous detection]] and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using [[envelope detector|envelope detection]]. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.\n\nA technique used widely in broadcast AM transmitters is an application of the Hapburg carrier, first proposed in the 1930s but impractical with the technology then available. During periods of low modulation the carrier power would be [[Dynamic carrier control|reduced]] and would return to full power during periods of high modulation levels. This has the effect of reducing the overall power demand of the transmitter and is most effective on speech type programmes. Various trade names are used for its implementation by the transmitter manufacturers from the late 80's onwards.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 10}, {"title": "Modulation index", "paragraphs": "The AM modulation index is a measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the RF signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier. It is thus defined as:\n:<math>m = \\frac{\\mathrm{peak\\ value\\ of\\ } m(t)}{A} = \\frac{M}{A}  </math>\n\nwhere <math>M\\,</math> and <math>A\\,</math> are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude, respectively; the modulation amplitude is the peak (positive or negative) change in the RF amplitude from its unmodulated value. Modulation index is normally expressed as a percentage, and may be displayed on a meter connected to an AM transmitter.\n\nSo if <math>m=0.5</math>, carrier amplitude varies by 50% above (and below) its unmodulated level, as is shown in the first waveform, below. For <math>m=1.0</math>, it varies by 100% as shown in the illustration below it. With 100% modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero, and this represents full modulation using standard AM and is often a target (in order to obtain the highest possible [[signal-to-noise ratio]]) but mustn't be exceeded. Increasing the modulating signal beyond that point, known as [[overmodulation]], causes a standard AM modulator (see below) to fail, as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero, resulting in [[distortion]] (\"clipping\") of the received modulation. Transmitters typically incorporate a [[limiter]] circuit to avoid overmodulation, and/or a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] circuit (especially for voice communications) in order to still approach 100% modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise. Such circuits are sometimes referred to as a [[vogad]].\n\nHowever it is possible to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of [[double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission]]. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power [[broadcast]] transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a [[linear amplifier]]. What's more, a standard AM receiver using an [[envelope detector]] is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally ''not'' referred to as \"AM\" even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]] where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term \"modulation index\" loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.\n\n[[File:Amplitude Modulated Wave-hm-64.svg|thumb|400px|center|Fig 4: Modulation depth.

The audio power requirement is 50 percent of the RF-carrier power.\n; Heising (constant-current) modulation: RF amplifier plate voltage is fed through a [[choke (electronics)|choke]] (high-value inductor). The AM modulation tube plate is fed through the same inductor, so the modulator tube diverts current from the RF amplifier. The choke acts as a constant current source in the audio range. This system has a low power efficiency.\n; Control grid modulation: The operating bias and gain of the final RF amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid. This method requires little audio power, but care must be taken to reduce distortion.\n; Clamp tube (screen grid) modulation: The screen-grid bias may be controlled through a ''clamp tube'', which reduces voltage according to the modulation signal. It is difficult to approach 100-percent modulation while maintaining low distortion with this system.\n; [[Doherty amplifier|Doherty modulation]]: One tube provides the power under carrier conditions and another operates only for positive modulation peaks. Overall efficiency is good, and distortion is low.\n; [[Ampliphase|Outphasing modulation]]: Two tubes are operated in parallel, but partially out of phase with each other. As they are differentially phase modulated their combined amplitude is greater or smaller. Efficiency is good and distortion low when properly adjusted.\n; [[Pulse-width modulation|Pulse-width modulation (PWM) or pulse-duration modulation (PDM)]]: A highly efficient high voltage power supply is applied to the tube plate. The output voltage of this supply is varied at an audio rate to follow the program.
