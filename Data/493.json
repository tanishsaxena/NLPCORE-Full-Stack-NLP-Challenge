He left school at the age of 13, following his father's death to help his widowed mother, and trained as a [[stonemason]]. Mackenzie immigrated to [[Canada]] when he was 19, settling in what became [[Ontario]]. His masonry business prospered, allowing him to pursue other interests \u2013 such as the editorship of a pro-[[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reformist]] of a newspaper called the'' Lambton Shield''.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} Mackenzie was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1861, as a supporter of [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]].\n\nIn 1867, Mackenzie was elected to the new [[House of Commons of Canada]] for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. He became leader of the party (thus [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]]) in mid-1873, and a few months later succeeded [[John A. Macdonald]] as prime minister, following Macdonald's resignation in the aftermath of the [[Pacific Scandal]]. Mackenzie and the Liberals won a clear majority at the [[1874 Canadian federal election|1874 election]]. He was popular among the general public for his humble background and apparent democratic tendencies.\n\nAs prime minister, Mackenzie continued the nation-building programme that had been begun by his predecessor. His government established the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and [[Royal Military College of Canada]], and created the [[District of Keewatin]] to better administer Canada's newly acquired western territories. However, it made little progress on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railway]], and struggled to deal with the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1873]]. At the [[1878 Canadian federal election|1878 election]], Mackenzie's government suffered a landslide defeat. He remained leader of the Liberal Party for another two years, and continued on as a [[Member of parliament#Canada|Member of Parliament]] until his death, due to a [[stroke]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "hatnote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "For other people see [[Alexander McKenzie (politician)]] and [[Alexander Mackenzie (disambiguation)]]."}]}, {"name": "short description", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2nd Prime Minister of Canada"}]}, {"name": "Use mdy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2014"}]}, {"name": "More footnotes", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "November 2017"}]}, {"name": "Infobox officeholder\n", "values": [{"name": "honorific-prefix", "value": "[[The Honourable]]<!--His correct prefix is \"The Honourable\", NOT \"The Right Honourable\"; see explanation on Talk page-->"}, {"name": "name", "value": "Alexander Mackenzie"}, {"name": "honorific-suffix", "value": "[[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]]"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Alexander McKenzie3.jpg"}, {"name": "alt", "value": "Monochrome photograph of Alexander Mackenzie sitting in a chair"}, {"name": "order1", "value": "2nd [[Prime Minister of Canada]]"}, {"name": "term_start1", "value": "November 7, 1873"}, {"name": "term_end1", "value": "October 8, 1878"}, {"name": "monarch1", "value": "[[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]"}, {"name": "governor_general1", "value": "[[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|The Earl of Dufferin]]"}, {"name": "predecessor1", "value": "[[John A.

The house in which he was born was built by his father and is still standing in 2019. He was the third of 10 boys, seven of whom survived infancy.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} Alexander Mackenzie, Sr., was a carpenter and ship's joiner who had to move around frequently for work after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Mackenzie's father died on 7 March 1836 and at the age of 13, Alexander Mackenzie, Jr., was thus forced to end his formal education to help support his family. He apprenticed as a stonemason and met his future wife, Helen Neil, in Irvine, where her father was also a stonemason.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} The Neils were Baptist and shortly thereafter, Mackenzie converted from [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Baptist]] beliefs.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} Together with the Neils, he immigrated to Canada in 1842 to seek a better life. Mackenzie's faith was to link him to the increasingly influential [[temperance cause]], particularly strong in [[Canada West]] where he lived, a constituency of which he was to represent in the [[Parliament of Canada]].{{sfnp|Forster|1990}}\n\nThe Neils and Mackenzie settled in Kingston, Ontario. The limestone in the area proved too hard for his stonemason tools, and not having money to buy new tools, Mackenzie took a job as a labourer constructing a building on Princess Street.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} The contractor on the job claimed financial difficulty, so Mackenzie accepted a promissory note for summer wages. The note later proved to be worthless. Subsequently, Mackenzie won a contract building a bomb-proof arch at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]]. He later became a foreman on the construction of Kingston's four [[Martello tower|Martello Towers]] - [[Murney Tower]], [[Fort Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Fort Frederick]], [[Cathcart Tower]], and [[Shoal Tower]]. He was also a foreman on the construction of the [[Welland Canal]] and the [[Lachine Canal]]. While working on the [[Beauharnois Canal]], a one-ton stone fell and crushed one of his legs. He recovered, but never regained the strength in that leg. While in Kingston, Mackenzie became a vocal opponent of religious and political entitlement and corruption in government.\n\nMackenzie married Helen Neil (1826\u201352) in 1845 and with her had three children, with only one girl, Mary, surviving infancy.{{sfnp|Harris|1893|p=136}} Helen and he moved to Sarnia, Ontario (known as Canada West) in 1847 and Mary was born in 1848.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} They were soon joined from Scotland by the rest of Mackenzie's brothers and his mother.{{sfnp|Forster|1990}} He began working as a general contractor, earning a reputation for being a hard-working, honest man, as well as having a working man's view on fiscal policy. Mackenzie helped construct many courthouses and jails across southern Ontario. A number of these still stand today, including the Sandwich Courthouse and Jail now known as the [[Windsor, Ontario|Mackenzie Hall Cultural Centre]] in Windsor, Ontario, and the [[Chatham Jail|Kent County Courthouse and Jail]] in Chatham, Ontario. He even bid, unsuccessfully, on the construction of the Parliament buildings in Ottawa in 1859. Helen died in 1852, finally succumbing to the effects of excessive doses of mercury-based calomel used to treat a fever while in Kingston. In 1853, he married [[Jane Mackenzie|Jane Sym]] (1825\u201393).{{sfnp|Harris|1893|p=136}}\n\n[[Image:Mason overseer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|An 1875 ''[[Canadian Illustrated News]]'' cartoon shows Mackenzie the Mason and Governor General [[Lord Dufferin]] the Overseer.]]\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Harris"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1893"}, {"name": "p", "value": "136"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Forster"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1990"}]}, {"name": "sfnp", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Harris"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1893"}, {"name": "p", "value": "136"}]}], "id": 1}, {"title": "Early political involvement", "paragraphs": "Mackenzie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in Canada. He fought passionately for equality and the elimination of all forms of class distinction. In 1851, he became the secretary for the [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reform Party]] for Lambton. After convincing him to run in Kent/Lambton, Mackenzie campaigned relentlessly for [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], owner of the [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reformist]] paper ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]'' in the 1851 election, helping Brown to win his first seat in the Legislative Assembly. Mackenzie and Brown remained the closest of friends and colleagues for the rest of their lives. In 1852, Mackenzie became editor of another reformist paper, the ''Lambton Shield''. As editor, Mackenzie was perhaps a little too vocal, leading the paper to a lawsuit for libel against the local conservative candidate. Because a key witness claimed Cabinet Confidence and would not testify, the paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship. After his brother, Hope Mackenzie, declined to run, Alexander was petitioned to run and won his first seat in the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of George Brown in 1861. When Brown resigned from the [[Great Coalition]] in 1865 over reciprocity negotiations with the United States, Mackenzie was invited to replace him as the president of the council. Wary of [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald's]] motivations and true to his principles, Mackenzie declined.\n\nHe entered the House of Commons of Canada in 1867, representing the [[Lambton (electoral district)|Lambton]], Ontario, riding. No cohesive national [[Liberal Party of Canada]] existed at the time and with Brown not winning his seat, no official leader emerged. Mackenzie did not believe he was the best qualified for the position, and although he resisted offers of the position, he nevertheless sat as the ''de facto'' leader of the Official Opposition.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "Prime Minister (1873\u20131878)", "paragraphs": "{{See also|Electoral history of Alexander Mackenzie}}\nWhen the [[John A.

Lord Dufferin expressed early misgivings about a stonemason taking over government, but on meeting Mackenzie, Dufferin revised his opinions:\n\n{{quote|text=However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I imagine he is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man.|author=Lord Dufferin|source=}}\n\nMackenzie served concurrently as Minister of Public Works and oversaw the completion of the Parliament buildings. While drawing up the plans for the [[West Block]], he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building, which allowed him to escape the patronage-seekers waiting for him in his ante-chamber. Proving Dufferin's reflections on his character to be true, Mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics. Nevertheless, he found it a necessary evil to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liberals.\n\n[[Image:Alexander Mackenzie Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Alexander Mackenzie on Parliament Hill, Ottawa by [[Hamilton MacCarthy]]]]\nIn keeping with his democratic ideals, Mackenzie refused the offer of a knighthood three times,<ref name=\"grave\"/> and was thus the only one of Canada's first eight Prime Ministers not to be knighted. He also declined appointment to the UK Privy Council and hence does not bear the title \"Right Honourable\". His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, \"I do. It is five feet, ten inches. I know, because I built it myself!\"<ref>Canada's Prime Ministers, 1867 \u2013 1994: Biographies and Anecdotes. [Ottawa]: National Archives of Canada, [1994]. 40 p.</ref>\n\nAs Prime Minister, Alexander Mackenzie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government, achieving a remarkable record of reform legislation. He introduced the [[secret ballot]]; advised the creation of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]; the establishment of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in 1874; and the creation of the Office of the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] in 1878. He completed the [[Intercolonial Railway]], but struggled to progress on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|national railway]] due to a worldwide economic depression, almost coming to blows with the then Governor General Lord Dufferin over imperial interference. Mackenzie stood up for the rights of Canada as a nation and fought for the supremacy of Parliament and honesty in government. Above all else, he was known and loved for his honesty and integrity.\n\nHowever, his term was marked by [[economic depression]] that had grown out of the [[Panic of 1873]], which Mackenzie's government was unable to alleviate. In 1874, Mackenzie negotiated a new [[free trade]] agreement with the United States, eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. However, this action did not bolster the economy, and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding. In 1876, the Conservative opposition announced a [[National Policy]] of protective tariffs, which resonated with voters. When an [[1878 Canadian federal election|election]] was held at the conclusion of Mackenzie's five-year term, the Conservatives were swept back into office in a landslide victory.\n\n=== Supreme Court appointments ===\n[[File:Alexander Mackenzie.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Mackenzie]]\nMackenzie chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Snell |first1=James G. |first2=Frederick |last2=Vaughan |chapter=The Founding of the Court 1867-1879 |title=The Supreme Court of Canada: History of the Institution |pages=3\u201327 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1985 |jstor=10.3138/j.ctvfrxdfw.5 |isbn=9780802034182 }}</ref>\n* Sir [[William Buell Richards]] ([[Chief Justice]])&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[T\u00e9lesphore Fournier]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[William Alexander Henry]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[William Johnstone Ritchie]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[Samuel Henry Strong]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau (judge)|Jean-Thomas Taschereau]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[Henri Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau]]&nbsp;\u2013 October 7, 1878\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Electoral history of Alexander Mackenzie"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "\u00c9ric"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Grenier"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Size of Justin Trudeau's government breaks records, for better and worse"}, {"name": "date", "value": "December 2, 2015"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "CBC"}, {"name": "url", "value": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-historical-trudeau-government-1.3344130"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "text", "value": "However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I imagine he is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man."}, {"name": "author", "value": "Lord Dufferin"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Snell"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "James G."}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Frederick"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Vaughan"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "The Founding of the Court 1867-1879"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Supreme Court of Canada: History of the Institution"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "3\u201327"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Toronto"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Toronto Press"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1985"}, {"name": "jstor", "value": "10.3138/j.ctvfrxdfw.5"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780802034182"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": " Supreme Court appointments ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Alexander Mackenzie.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Mackenzie]]\nMackenzie chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Snell |first1=James G. |first2=Frederick |last2=Vaughan |chapter=The Founding of the Court 1867-1879 |title=The Supreme Court of Canada: History of the Institution |pages=3\u201327 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1985 |jstor=10.3138/j.ctvfrxdfw.5 |isbn=9780802034182 }}</ref>\n* Sir [[William Buell Richards]] ([[Chief Justice]])&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[T\u00e9lesphore Fournier]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[William Alexander Henry]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[William Johnstone Ritchie]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[Samuel Henry Strong]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau (judge)|Jean-Thomas Taschereau]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[Henri Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau]]&nbsp;\u2013 October 7, 1878\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Snell"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "James G."}, {"name": "first2", "value": "Frederick"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Vaughan"}, {"name": "chapter", "value": "The Founding of the Court 1867-1879"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Supreme Court of Canada: History of the Institution"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "3\u201327"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Toronto"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Toronto Press"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1985"}, {"name": "jstor", "value": "10.3138/j.ctvfrxdfw.5"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780802034182"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Later life", "paragraphs": "After his government's defeat, Mackenzie remained [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] for another two years, until 1880.

His sterling honesty is a great heritage, and will keep his memory green to all future generations.\u201d{{sfnp|Ross|1913|p=31}} At his eulogy, Rev.

In the dark days of \u201973, Canadians were in a state of panic, distrusting the stability of their newly-built Dominion; no one can tell what would have happened had not the stalwart form of Alexander Mackenzie lifted itself above the screaming, vociferating and denying mass of politicians, and all Canada felt at once, there was a man who could be trusted.{{sfnp|Buckingham|Ross|1892|p=661}} The ''Toronto Globe'' \u2013 he was a man who loved the people and fought for their rights against privilege and monopoly in every form.{{sfnp|Buckingham|Ross|1892|p=661}} The ''Philadelphia Record'' \u2013 Like Caesar, who twice refused a knightly crown, Alexander Mackenzie refused knighthood three times.
