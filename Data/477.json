The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician]]s and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context; this use has become rare. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Use dmy dates", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "September 2015"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Dictionary definitions", "paragraphs": "The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term \"artist\":\n\n* A learned person or Master of Arts\n* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]\n* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice\n* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic\n* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art\n* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] \u2013 traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "History of the term", "paragraphs": "The Greek word \"techn\u011b\", often translated as \"art,\" implies mastery of any sort of craft.

''technic''\n</ref>\nbecame the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].\n\nIn Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:\n* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]\n* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history\n* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs\n* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]\n* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]\n* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]\n* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance\n* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]\n* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]\n\nNo muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.<ref>\n''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002</ref>\n\nThe word ''art'' derives from the Latin \"ars\" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined means \"skill method\" or \"technique\", also conveys a connotation of beauty.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some \"artisanal\" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.\n\nThe first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], [[De statua]], [[De pictura]]'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).<ref>\nP.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998</ref>\n\nWith the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.\n\nMany contemporary definitions of \"artist\" and \"art\" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 2}, {"title": "The present day concept of an 'artist'", "paragraphs": "''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as \"a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium\". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.\n\nMost often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music\u2014people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.\n\nThe term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-\"art\" activities, as well\u2014 law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.\n\nOften, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among \"artist\" and \"[[technician]]\", \"entertainer\" and \"[[artisan]]\", \"[[fine arts|fine art]]\" and \"[[applied art]]\", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means \"artist\") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word \"artiste\" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.<ref>Kenneth G. Wilson.
