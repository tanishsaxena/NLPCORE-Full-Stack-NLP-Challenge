The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. He is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe,  or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''.<ref>Krauskopf, I. 2006. \"The Grave and Beyond.\" ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.</ref>\n\nAs the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] god\u2014the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the \"averter of evil\". Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers, foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees. \n\nMedicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows.\n\nApollo's capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As the protector of young (''kourotrophos''), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo. \n\nApollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. He is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]]. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city.\n\nAs the god of ''Mousike'' (art of Muses), Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[Apollo#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|god of the sun]].<ref>For the iconography of the Alexander\u2013Helios type, see H.

The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]]. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain \"purification\".<ref name=Nilsson563/>\n\nA similar story is mentioned by [[Plutarch]]. He writes that the [[Creta]]n [[prophet|seer]] [[Epimenides]] purified [[Athens]] after the pollution brought by the [[Alcmeonidae]], and that the seer's expertise in [[sacrifice]]s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to [[Solon]] in his reform of the Athenian state.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'', 12; [[Aristotle]], ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol]]''. 1.</ref> The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the [[Shamanism#Asia|shamanic religions of Asia]], and proves, together with the [[Homeric]] hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to [[Anatolia]].\n\n[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods.

About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd-\u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ae\u03c9\u03bd"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ae\u03c9\u03bd"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "gmy"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\ud800\udc1e\ud800\udc0a\ud800\udc3a\ud800\udc1a"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Mycenaeans"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=QXwzT1048Z4C&lpg=PA144&pg=PA160#v=onepage"}, {"name": "page", "value": "160"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Louise"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Schofield"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "The British Museum Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-89236-867-9"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52"}, {"name": "title", "value": "KN V 52+"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Deaditerranean: Minoan Linear A & Mycenaean Linear B"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Chadwick"}, {"name": "first", "value": "John"}, {"name": "author-link", "value": "John Chadwick"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Mycenaean World"}, {"name": "location", "value": "Cambridge, UK"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Cambridge University Press"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1976"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-521-29037-1"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA89#v=onepage"}, {"name": "page", "value": "89"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f30\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f18\u03c0\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \u1f84\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03bf\u1f54\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "LSJ", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "ou)/lios"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03bf\u1f54\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2"}, {"name": "3", "value": "shortref"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03bb\u03bf\u03af\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f00\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03c9"}]}, {"name": "lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "grc"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd"}]}, {"name": "cite book", "values": [{"name": "last", "value": "Graf"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Fritz"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Apollo"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&pg=PA66"}, {"name": "year", "value": "2008"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Taylor & Francis"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "978-0-203-58171-1"}, {"name": "page", "value": "66"}]}, {"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2199?msg=welcome_stranger"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Iliad"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Homer"}, {"name": "first", "value": "750?

They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divinity|divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.<ref>To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it\": Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108</ref> From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.<ref name=\"C. M.

''The Greek experience'', p. 166.</ref>\n \nThe [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.\n\nThe most important temples are:\n\n===Greek temples===\n*[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century B.C.

Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to Apollo. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet ''Lyceus'', meaning ''wolf-like''. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role of the pastoral god who protected flocks from predators. The hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman.<ref>Anna Afonasina, ''Shamanism and the Orphic tradition''</ref><ref>Fritz Graf, ''Apollo''</ref> Shamans like [[Abaris]] and [[Aristeas]] were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.\n\nIn myths, Apollo wept tears of ambers on the banks of Eridanos when his son Asclepius died and buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the [[Cyclopes]]. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.<ref>Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' 4. 594</ref>\n\n===Childhood and Youth===\n\nAs a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later became ''[[Archegetes]]'', the founder of towns and god who guided men to build new cities.<ref name=\"Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo\"/> From his father Zeus, Apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans.<ref>Timothy P.

To avenge the trouble given to his mother, the young Apollo, with his bow and arrows that he had received from [[Hephaestus]], went in search of Python and killed it in the sacred cave at Delphi with his arrows. The Delphian nymphs were present and encouraged Apollo during the battle with the cry \"Hie [[Paean]]\". After Apollo was victorious, they also brought him gifts and gave the [[Corycian cave]] to him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>''Children of the Gods'' by Kenneth McLeish, page 32.</ref> According to Homer, Apollo had encountered and killed the Python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine.\n\nAccording to other versions, when Leto was in Delphi, Python had attacked her. Apollo defended his mother and killed Python.<ref>Euripides Iphigenia in Tauris</ref> [[Euripides]] in his [[Iphigenia in Aulis]] gives an account of his fight with Python and the events aftermath. \n<blockquote>You killed him, o Phoebus, while still a baby, still leaping in the arms of your dear mother, and you entered the holy shrine, and sat on the golden tripod, on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals.</blockquote>\n\nA detailed account of Apollo's conflict with Gaea and Zeus' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given. \n<blockquote>But when Apollo came and sent Themis, the child of Earth, away from the holy oracle of Pytho, Earth gave birth to dream visions of the night; and they told to the cities of men the present, and what will happen in the future, through dark beds of sleep on the ground; and so Earth took the office of prophecy away from Phoebus, in envy, because of her daughter. The lord made his swift way to Olympus and wound his baby hands around Zeus, asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the Pythian home. Zeus smiled, that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold. He shook his locks of hair, put an end to the night voices, and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness, and gave the privilege back again to Loxias.</blockquote>\nApollo also demanded that all the other methods of divination be made inferior, and Zeus granted him that too. Because of this, Athena, who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles, cast her pebbles away in displeasure.<ref>John Opsopaus, ''The Oracles of Apollo: Practical Ancient Greek Divination for Today''</ref>\n\n[[File:Apollo Killing the Python LACMA 54.70.1i.jpg|thumb|Apollo killing the Python, by Hendrik Goltzius]]\n\nHowever, Apollo had committed a blood murder, and had to be purified.

So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The [[Pythia]] was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals.\n\n====Tityos====\n[[File:Apollo Tityos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2689.jpg|thumb|Apollo slaying [[Tityos]], Attic red-figure kylix, 460\u2013450 BC]]\n\nHera once again sent another giant, [[Tityos]] to rape Leto.

She displayed [[hubris]] when she boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.\n\nA devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.\n\nWhen Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 10</ref>\n\n===Exile in Troy===\n\nOnce Apollo, along with [[Athena]] and [[Poseidon]], participated in Hera's scheme to hold Zeus captive and demand a better rule from him. Though they were successful in trapping Zeus with nets, Zeus managed to get himself freed with the help of [[Thetis]]. Feeling betrayed and angry, he sent Apollo and Poseidon to serve as slaves under the Trojan king [[Laomedon]]. According to other version, both gods went there to test Laomedon. Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy. Later, Apollo was also joined hands in building the walls. \n\nIn [[Pindar]]'s account, the gods took a mortal named [[Aeacus]] as their assistant.<ref>[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &c.</ref>  When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]] (i.e. his sons Telamon joined [[Heracles]] when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great grandson [[Neoptolemus]] was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of Troy). \n\n[[File:Sandrart (attributed), Troppa (attr.) - Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo - 17th c.jpg|thumb|Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by [[Joachim von Sandrart]]]]\n\nIn Ovid's account, Apollo built the walls merely by playing his lyre. The king, however, refused to give the gods the wages he had promised. Angered, Apollo sent a pestilence to the city. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter [[Hesione]] (who would later be saved by [[Heracles]]).\n\nDuring his exile, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, a nymph daughter of Poseidon, and sired a son whom he named Ileus after the city.\n\n===Trojan War===\n\nApollo sided with the Trojans during the [[Trojan war]], a war waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.\n\nDuring the war, [[Agamemnon]], a Greek hero captured [[Chryseis]], the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]]. Angered, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded to return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.\n \n[[File:John Flaxman - Apollo Preceding Hector with His Aegis, and Dispersing the Greeks, Fuseli's Lectures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Apollo preceding [[Hector]] with his [[Aegis]], and dispersing the Greeks, by John Flaxman]]\n\nReceiving the [[aegis]] from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's wish, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry, pushing them back and destroying many of them. He is described as \"the rouser of armies\", because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.\n\nWhen Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.\n\n[[File:Diomedes prevented by Apollo from pursuing Aeneas (?) MET 80355.jpg|thumb|Apollo prevents [[Diomedes]] from pursuing [[Aeneas]]]]\n\nWhen [[Diomedes]], the Greek hero, injured [[Aeneas]], a Trojan ally, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue him but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]], where he was healed.\n\nAfter the death of [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]], a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.\n\n[[File:Hector's body dragged at the Chariot of Achilles.jpg|thumb|Apollo protecting Hector's body, by John Flaxman]]\n\nThe Trojan hero [[Hector]] was favored by Apollo, who, according to some, was the god's own son by [[Hecuba]].<ref>[[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''  266; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo.</ref> When he got injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up the arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse.\n\nThe Greek warrior [[Patroclus]] tried to get into the fort of Troy and was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of Patroclus and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector.\n\n[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|[[Achilles]] slaying [[Troilus]]]]\n\nApollo held anger towards Achilles throughout the war. The reason for this was the murder of his son [[Tenes]] before the war began, and brutal assassination of his another son [[Troilus]] in his own temple, both by Achilles. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.\n\nFinally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] into [[Achilles]]' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.\n\nApollo helped many Trojan warriors, including [[Agenor]], [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]], [[Glaucus]] in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.\n\n===Heracles===\n\nAfter [[Heracles]] (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king [[Eurystheus]] for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him as Heracles.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1</ref>\n\n[[File:Corinthian helmet Cdm Paris BB2013 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Heracles and Apollo struggling over the Hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)]]\n\nTo complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring it alive. He chased the hind for one year. When the animal eventually got tired and tried crossing the river Ladon, he captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who was angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess, explained the situation and pleaded her. In the end, Artemis gave her consent.\n\n[[File:Herakles tripod Louvre F341.jpg|thumb|Heracles steals Apollo's tripod, Attic black-figure oinochoe, ca. 520 BC.]]\n\nAfter he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in hopes to get rid of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started going away, intending to start his own [[Oracle]]. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles. A duel ensued between Apollo and Heracles where Athena supported the latter. Soon, Zeus intervened between the fighting brothers by throwing his thunderbolt between them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation, and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under [[Omphale]], queen of [[Lydia]] for one year in order to purify himself.\n\n===Periphas===\n\n[[Periphas]] was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.<ref>Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 6</ref>\n\n===Plato's concept of soulmates===\n\nA long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and fours legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly. [[Aloadae|Otis]] and [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] even dared to scale [[Mount Olympus]].\n\nTo check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the [[abdomen]], and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call [[navel]] today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment.<ref>Plato, ''[[The Symposium]]''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"As he [Zeus] cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn... Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre [of the belly] which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few wrinkles, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state.</blockquote>\n\n===Nurturer of the young===\n\nApollo ''Kourotrophos'' is the god who nurtures and protects the children and youth, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the [[Muses]]. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.\n\n[[Chiron]], the abandoned [[centaur]] was fostered by Apollo who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron's calm nature and wisdom, in contrast to rest of the centaurs, is attributed to the quality education Apollo gave him. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.\n\n[[Asclepius]] in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.\n\n[[Anius]], Apollo's son by [[Rhoeo]], was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.\n\n[[Iamus]] was the son of Apollo and [[Evadne]]. When he reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.<ref>Pindar, Olympian Ode 6</ref>\n\n[[Idmon]] was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the [[Argonauts]], he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boetians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.<ref>Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica ii, 846 ff</ref>\n\nApollo adopted [[Carnus]], the abandoned son of Zeus and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer. \n \nApollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.<ref>The Cyclopedia, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, Volume 37</ref>\n\n===God of music===\n\nImmediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and ivented [[paean]], thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. [[Plato]] said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses.<ref>[[Plato]], ''Laws'' 653.4</ref> According to [[Socrates]], ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called ''Homopolon'' before the ''Homo'' was replaced by ''A''.<ref>The prefix ''A'' means \"without\" or \"not\", and ''polloi'' means \"many\", thus ''Apollo'' means \"not many\" or \"united\", referring to his ability to create harmony.</ref><ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]</ref>Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.<ref>[[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Apollo''</ref> The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the \"singers of Apollo\". They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to [[Hyperborea]].<ref>[[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Apollo''</ref> [[Aelian]] says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.<ref>[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the nature of Animals'' 11. 1 </ref>\n\nAmong the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity.<ref>[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Varia Historia]]'', 2. 26</ref><ref>[[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], 8.13</ref><ref>[[Iamblichus]], ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8.91.141</ref> Their belief was that the music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the [[music of the spheres]].<ref>Landels, John G (1999) ''Music in Ancient Greece and Rome''</ref> \n\n[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|The music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.]]\n\nApollo appears as the companion of the [[Muses]] and as ''[[Musagetes]]'' (leader of Muses), he leads them into the dance. They spend their time on [[Parnassus]], which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses, and by them he became the father of famous musicians like [[Orpheus]] and [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]]. \n\nApollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the [[lyre]].<ref>Iliad (i. 603)</ref> In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods, like the marriage of [[Eros]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. He is a frequent guest of the [[bacchanalia]] and many ancient pottery depict him being at ease amidst the [[maenads]] and satyrs.<ref>Detienne, Marcel (2001) ''Forgetting Delphi between Apollo and Dionysus''</ref> Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others.

He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his [[lyre]].\n\n[[File:No\u00ebl Coypel - Story of Apollo-Apollo and Mercury, 1688.jpg|thumb|The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by [[No\u00ebl Coypel]]]]\n\nUpon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.\n\n[[File:Detail of the statue of Apollo holding the kithara, from the Temple of Venus (Casino Fede) at Hadrian's Villa, Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteket (12233881783).jpg|thumb|Detail of Apollo's lyre]]\n\nAccording to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repent to the excess punishment he had given to [[Marsyas]]. Hermes' lyre, therefore, is rather a reinvention.<ref>Norman O. Brown, ''Hermes the thief''</ref>\n\n====Contest with Pan====\n[[File:Laurits Regner Tuxen The-Musical-Dual-Of-Pan-And-Apollo.jpg|thumb|The musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]\nOnce [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo, the god of music. The mountain-god [[Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].\n\n====Contest with Marsyas====\n[[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who was punished by Apollo for his [[hubris]]. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s, or the nymphs of [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]]. Athena was also present to witness the contest.\n\n[[File:Athena Marsyas.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] and [[Marsyas]]]]\n\nMarsyas taunted Apollo for \"wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts\".<ref name=\"Apuleius, Florida 3.2\">Apuleius, ''Florida'' 3.2</ref> He also further said\n\n<blockquote>'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!'<ref name=\"Apuleius, Florida 3.2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor can \"do whatever he wanted\" to the loser. Marsyas, since he was a satyr,  expected to do something sexual in nature to Apollo when he would win the contest.\n\n[[File:05apol1.jpg|thumb|The contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Palma il Giovane]]]]\n\nAccording to one account, after they each had performed, both were deemed equal by the [[Nysiads]]. But in the next round, Apollo played and sang with his melodious voice at the same time. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was almost the same as singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo again played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusation, he decided to flay the satyr.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3</ref>\n\nAccording to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.<ref>Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks)</ref>\nAnother variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the [[flute]]), and so the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner, who hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.<ref>''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish</ref>\n\n[[File:Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo - Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo (1735).jpg|thumb|Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo, by\t[[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]]]]\n\nApollo [[flaying|flayed]] the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 165</ref> and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But, Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he broke the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]] and [[Orpheus]]. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god laid away both the lyre and the pipes, and joined [[Cybele]] in her wanderings to as far as [[Hyperborea]].<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/><ref>Apostle Arne Horn, ''The Book of Eusebius'' #4</ref>\n\n====Contest with Cinyras====\n\nCinyras was a ruler of [[Cyprus]], who was a friend of [[Agamemnon]]. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], and defeated him.

In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for safe journey.\n\nWhen Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.<ref>Homer, ''Hymn to Pythian Apollo''</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Argonauts]] faced a terrible storm, [[Jason]] prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed \"[[Anafi|Anaphe]]\", which means \"He revealed it\".<ref>Apollonius of Rhodes, ''Argonautica''</ref>\n\nApollo helped the Greek hero, [[Diomedes]], to escape from a great tempest during his journey back to home. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo Epibaterius, Apollo the embarker.<ref>John Potter, ''Archaeologia Graeca: Or, The Antiquities of Greece, Volume 1''</ref>\n\nDuring the Trojan war, [[Odysseus]] came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that would help Odysseus reach safely back to the Greek camp.<ref>Homer, ''the Ilaid'' 1</ref>\n\n[[Arion]] was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.\n\n===Wars===\n\n====Titanomachy====\nOnce [[Hera]], out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against [[Zeus]] and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb [[Mount Olympus]], Zeus with the help of Apollo, [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]], defeated them and cast them into tartarus.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 150</ref>\n\n====Trojan war====\nApollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan war. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]]. He killed the Greek heroes [[Patroclus]], Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being [[Hector]].\n\n[[File:Paris armour Pomarici Santomasi.jpg|thumb|Paris (on the left) putting on his armour as Apollo (on the right) watches him.

The gods Athena and [[Ares]] came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel.

Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus' last hours glorious by \"lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam\". When [[Hypseus]] tried to kill the hero by a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like [[Melaneus (mythology)|Melaneus]], [[Antiphus]], Aetion, Polites and [[Lampus]]. At last when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.<ref>Statius, ''Thebaid'' 7</ref>\n\n===Slaying of giants===\n\nApollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.\n\n====Gigantomachy====\nDuring the [[gigantomachy]], Apollo killed the giant [[Ephialtes (disambiguation)|Ephialtes]] by shooting him in his eyes. He also killed [[Porphyrion]], the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.<ref>Pindar, Pythian 8.12\u201318</ref>\n\n====Aloadae====\nOtis and Ephialtes, the twin giants were together called the [[Aloadae]]. These giants are said to have grown every year by one cubit in breadth and three cubits in height.<ref>{https://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GigantesAloadai.html}</ref> They once threatened to wage a war on gods and attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains. They also threatened to change land into sea and sea into land. Some say they even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting arrows at them.<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' 11. 305</ref> According to another tale, Apollo killed them with a trick. He sent a deer between them. As they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 28</ref>\n\n====Phorbas====\n[[Phorbas]] was a savage giant king of [[Phlegyas (Boeotia)|Phlegyas]] who was described as having swine like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.<ref>Philostratus the Elder, ''Imagines'' 2. 19</ref>\n\n===Other stories===\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher - The Rising of the Sun - WGA02916.jpg|thumb|Apollo as the rising sun, by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]]]\n \nIn the first [[Olympic games]], Apollo defeated [[Ares]] and became the victor in wrestling.

One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swines their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to [[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]] upon her deification.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62. 3-4</ref>\n\n=====Prometheus=====\n\n[[Prometheus]] was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day.

Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought for the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera.<ref>Ptolemy Hephaestion, ''New History Book'' 7</ref> \n\nAnother tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself.

His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful.\n\n[[File:1590. Apollo Entrusting Chiron with the Education of Aescalapius - etching - Washington DC, NGA.jpg|thumb|Apollo Entrusting [[Chiron]] with the Education of Aescalapius]]\n\n[[Asclepius]] is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god. \n[[Aristaeus]] was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity. The [[Corybantes]] were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.\n\nThe sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes [[Hector]] and [[Troilus]], as well as [[Tenes]], the king of [[Tenedos]], all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.\n\nApollo's children who became musicians and bards include [[Orpheus]], [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]], [[Ialemus]], [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]]aeus, [[Philammon]], [[Eumolpus]] and [[Eleuther]]. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, [[Apollonis]], [[Borysthenis]] and [[Cephisso]], who formed a group of minor Muses, the \"Musa Apollonides\". They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaiApollonides.html | title=MUSES APOLLONIDES (Mousai) - Greek Goddesses of Music}}</ref> [[Phemonoe]] was a seer and a poetess who was the inventor of Hexameter.\n\n[[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], [[Idmon]], [[Iamus]], [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]], [[Mopsus]], [[Themisto (disambiguation)|Galeus]], Telmessus and others were gifted seers.

Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death.\n\nAdditionally, Apollo fostered and educated [[Chiron]], the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered [[Carnus]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].\n\n===Failed love attempts===\n\n[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.\n\n[[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.\n\n[[Bolina]] was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph and let her go.\n\n[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.\n\n[[Cassandra]], was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.\n\n[[Hestia]], the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.\n\n====Consorts and children: extended list====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comparative table of Apollo's family\n!Consort\n!Children\n!Consort\n!Children\n!Loved / Wooed\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]]\n|\u2022 Amphithemis (Garamas)<ref>[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1491 ff</ref>\n|[[Hypermnestra#Daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis|Hypermnestra]]\n|\u2022 [[Amphiaraus]]\n|\u2022 [[Amphissa (mythology)|Amphissa / Isse]]\n|-\n|\u2022 Caphauras<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=A Classical Manual, being a Mythological, Historical and Geographical Commentary on Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Aeneid of Virgil with a Copious Index|last=Murray|first=John|year=1833|isbn=|location=Albemarle Street, London|pages=18}}</ref>\n|Hyria (Thyria)\n|\u2022 [[Cycnus#Son of Apollo|Cycnus]]\n|\u2022 [[Cassandra]] (unsuccessful) \n|-\n|\u2022 [[Miletus (mythology)|Miletus]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Hecuba]]\n|\u2022 [[Troilus]]\n|\u2022 [[Bolina]] (unsuccessful) \n|-\n|\u2022 Naxos<ref>[[eponym]] of the island [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]</ref><ref>[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1491 ff</ref>\n|\u2022 [[Hector]]<ref>[[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo.</ref>\n|\u2022 [[Castalia]] (unsuccessful) \n|-\n|\u2022 Oaxes<ref name=\":4\">[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]]'s Eclogue 1, 65</ref><ref>[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''Ethnica'' s.v.

In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,<ref>Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197</ref> which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the [[Hellenic period]].<ref name=\"theoi.com\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Artemis.html | title=ARTEMIS - Greek Goddess of Hunting & Wild Animals}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Apollo and Artemis, 1770.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Artemis, by Gavin Hamilton]]\n\nArtemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows.

Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.<ref name=\"theoi.com\"/> The laurel (''[[daphne]]'') was sacred to both.

They both are cousins, since their mothers - [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean \"working from afar\". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKoios.html | title=COEUS (Koios) - Greek Titan God of Intellect & the Axis of Heaven}}</ref> If Hecate is the \"gate-keeper\", Apollo ''Agyieus'' is the \"door-keeper\".

There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.\n\n====Athena====\n\nAs a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of [[Athena]]. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities.

Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).\n\nApollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's [[Supplication|supplicant]].

In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,<ref>Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197</ref> which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the [[Hellenic period]].<ref name=\"theoi.com\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Artemis.html | title=ARTEMIS - Greek Goddess of Hunting & Wild Animals}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Apollo and Artemis, 1770.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Artemis, by Gavin Hamilton]]\n\nArtemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.<ref name=\"theoi.com\"/> The laurel (''[[daphne]]'') was sacred to both. ''Artemis Daphnaia'' had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.<ref>G.

They both are cousins, since their mothers - [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean \"working from afar\". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKoios.html | title=COEUS (Koios) - Greek Titan God of Intellect & the Axis of Heaven}}</ref> If Hecate is the \"gate-keeper\", Apollo ''Agyieus'' is the \"door-keeper\".

However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as \"born in Lycia\", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).\n\nIn literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason\u2014characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].\n\nApollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]].

The earliest Greek word for a statue is \"delight\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.\n\nThe naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.\n\nThe evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal [[Kouros]] type in [[Archaic period in Greece|early archaic period]], to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in [[Archaic period in Greece|late archaic period]]. In [[classical Greece]] the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by [[Polykleitos]]. Finally [[Praxiteles]] seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] with stylization.\n\n===Art and Greek philosophy===\nThe evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of [[Thales]] to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory of [[Pythagoras]]. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older [[animism]]. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.<ref name=\"Homann63\">E. Homann-Wedeking. Transl. J.R. Foster (1968). ''Art of the world. Archaic Greece'', Methuen & Co Ltd. London, pp. 63\u201365, 193.</ref>\n\nPythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.<ref name=\"C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166\"/> The forms on Earth, are imperfect imitations ({{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2}}, ''eikones'', \"images\") of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art. The Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.<ref name=\"Carpenter55\">R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. pp. 55\u201358.</ref> ([[Aesthetic canon|canon]]).\n\nIn classical Greece, [[Anaxagoras]] asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and [[Plato]] extended the Greek belief of ''ideal forms'' to his metaphysical theory of ''forms'' (''ideai'', \"ideas\"). The forms on Earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words ''oida'' ({{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1}}, \"(I) know\") and ''eidos'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"species\"), a thing seen, have the same root as the word ''idea'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1}}), a thing \u1f30\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd to see.<ref>\"The same root of looking or seeing\" .

The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization.

The formality of their stance seems to be related with the [[Egypt]]ian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.<ref name=\"Bowra144\">C. M. Bowra (1957).
