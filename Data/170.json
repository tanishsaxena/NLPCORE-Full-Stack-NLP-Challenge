[[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded S\u0101o Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575. S\u00e3o Felipe de Benguella ([[Benguela]]) followed in 1587.\n\nThe principal early trade was in [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]]. Portuguese merchants purchased the slaves from the local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples, [[Slavery in Africa|notable slave hunters]], and sold them to the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s in [[Captaincies of Brazil|Brazil]]. Brazilian ships were frequent visitors to Luanda and Benguela and Angola functioned as a kind of colony of Brazil, with Brazilian [[Jesuits]] active in its religious and educational centers.\n\nThe [[Portuguese Empire]] was neglected during the period of the [[Iberian Union]], which lasted from 1580 to 1640. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], bitter enemies of their former masters in [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions. During Portugal's separatist war against Spain, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1640 to 1648, calling it \"Fort Aardenburgh\". The Dutch used the territory to supply their own slaves to the sugarcane plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]), which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. Portugal recovered the territory between 1648 and 1650.\n\nIn the high plains, the Planalto, the most important native states were [[Bi\u00e9 Province|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. Portugal expanded into their territory,{{when|date=June 2015}} but did not control much of the interior prior to the late 19th century.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}}\n\nThe Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Following the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was formally abolished in 1836. However it did continue locally into the 20th century. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.\n\nBy 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside of [[Mainland Portugal]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} full of trading companies,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} exporting peanut oil,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} copal,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} timber,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and cocoa.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The principal exports of the post-slave economy in the 19th century were [[rubber]], beeswax, and ivory.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} Maize, tobacco, dried meat and [[cassava]] flour also began to be locally produced.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Prior to the [[First World War]], exportation of [[coffee]], [[palm tree|palm]] kernels and [[palm oil|oil]], [[cattle]], [[leather]] and [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and [[salt fish]] joined the principal exports, with small quantities of gold and [[cotton]] also being produced.<ref>{{cite EB1911|ref=harv |wstitle=Angola |volume=2 |page=39}}</ref> Grains, sugar, and rum were also produced for local consumption.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} The principal imports were foodstuffs, cotton goods, hardware, and British coal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} Legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s.

Mobutu and Sp\u00ednola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]].

Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs to build roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, have brought agricultural activities to a near-standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. [[Coffee]] production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. Expanding oil production is now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}. Diamonds provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nThis is a chart of trend of [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] [[gross domestic product]] of Angola at market prices using International Monetary Fund data;<ref name=\"gdptrend\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=1995&ED=2005&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=614&S=NGDP-NGDPD&RequestTimeout=120&CMP=0 |title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects |publisher=Imf.org |date=2003-04-29 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref> figures are in millions of units.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year || Gross Domestic Product (*$1,000,000) || US Dollar Exchange || Per Capita Income<br/> (as % of USA)\n|-\n|1980 || || || 6.33\n|-\n|1985 || || || 4.46\n|-\n|1990 || || || 4.42\n|-\n|1995 || 5,066 || 14 Angolan Kwanza || 1.58\n|-\n|2000 || 9,135 || 91,666 Angolan Kwanza || 1.96\n|-\n|2005 || 28,860 || 2,515,452 Angolan Kwanza || 4.73\n|}\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.
