developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]] and [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 1}, {"title": "Global competitiveness", "paragraphs": "{{See also|Armenia#International_Economy-related_Rankings}}\nIn the 2019 report (data for 2017) of [[Economic Freedom of the World]] published by [[Fraser Institute]] Armenia ranks 27th (classified most free) out of 162 economies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018-annual-report|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report|date=2018-09-25|work=Fraser Institute|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.fraserinstitute.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2019 report of [[Global Competitiveness Index]] Armenia ranks 69th out of 141 economies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2019|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2020 report (data for 2019) of [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] Index Armenia ranks 47th with 10th rank on \"starting business\" sub-index.\n\nIn the 2019 report (data for 2018) of [[Human Development Index]] by [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] Armenia ranked 81st and is classified into \"high human development\" group.\n\nIn the 2018 report (data for 2017) of [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] by [[Transparency International]] Armenia ranked 105 of 180 countries.\n\nIn the 2019 report of [[Index of Economic Freedom]] by [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]], Armenia ranked 47th, ahead of countries like Belgium, France, Portugal and Italy.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "See also", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Armenia#International_Economy-related_Rankings"}]}, {"name": "Cite news", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018-annual-report"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2018-09-25"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Fraser Institute"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2018-11-06"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom"}, {"name": "title", "value": "You are being redirected..."}, {"name": "website", "value": "www.fraserinstitute.org"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2019-10-24"}]}, {"name": "Cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Global Competitiveness Report 2019"}, {"name": "website", "value": "World Economic Forum"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "2019-10-24"}]}], "id": 2}, {"title": "History of the modern Armenian economy", "paragraphs": "At the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of present-day Armenia was a backward agricultural region with some [[copper]] mining and [[cognac]] production. From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from war, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Trans-100millones-rev.jpg|thumbnail|100 million rubles banknote]]\n\nThe first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning [[grain]] from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921&ndash;27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nThe Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a \"proletarian\" society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the [[net material product]] of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42&ndash;43}}\n\n[[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nArmenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=43}}\n\nIn 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992&ndash;93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=41}}\n\n===Post-communist economic reform===\nArmenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread [[corruption]] and [[bribery]]. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=48&ndash;50}}\n\nBeginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nIn the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]], to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nA few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the [[American University of Armenia]] in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nArmenia was admitted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 1992 and to the [[World Bank]] in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all [[tariff]]s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister [[Hrant Bagratyan]] informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50&ndash;51}}\n\nLike other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally [[planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nArmenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily [[Armenia Telephone Company|Armentel]], which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]].\n\nBy 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.\n\nThe chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|Metsamor]], which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "42"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "42"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "42"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "42&ndash;43"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "43"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "41"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "48&ndash;50"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "50"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "50"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "50"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Curtis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1995"}, {"name": "p", "value": "50&ndash;51"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Post-communist economic reform", "paragraphs": "Armenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] began advocating economic reform.

According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector \u2013 abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\nPolitical observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government's work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and later President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], initially Kocharyan's closest political associate.
