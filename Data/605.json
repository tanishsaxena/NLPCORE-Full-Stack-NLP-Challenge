Ecgbert had been a disciple of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], who urged him to raise York to an [[archbishopric]]. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and re-organisation of the [[History of the Church of England|English church]], with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.\n\nThe York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.{{sfn|Hutchison|2006}} It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. He revived the school with the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] disciplines,{{sfn|Burns|1907}} writing a [[codex]] on the trivium, while his student [[Rabanus Maurus|Hraban]] wrote one on the quadrivium.\n\nAlcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]], began after [[Ethelbert of York|Aelbert]] became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time Alcuin became a [[deacon]] in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though there is no real evidence that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.\n\nIn 781, King [[\u00c6lfwald I of Northumbria|Elfwald]] sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [[Eanbald I]]. On his way home he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of [[Parma]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2016|page=207}} asserts Charlemagne met Alcuin \u2013 for the second time \u2013 at Parma in 781}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Story|2005|p=137}} reports that Alcuin had previously been sent to Charlemagne by Ethelbert.}}\n\n===Charlemagne===\n{{Scholasticism}}\nAlcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], Rado, and [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. Alcuin would later write that \"the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles.\"\n\nAlcuin became Master of the [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Palace]] School of Charlemagne in [[Aachen]] (''Urbs Regale'') in 782.{{sfn|Burns|1907}} It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [[liberal arts]] and, most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]]. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.\n\nIn this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, \"Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.\" His arguments seem to have prevailed \u2013 Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.{{sfn|Needham|2000|p=52}}\n\nCharlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.{{sfn|Wilmot-Buxton|1922|p=93}} Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [[Aachen]], Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils \u2013 derived mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.{{sfn|Jaeger|1999|p=38}} According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', \"He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king's esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.<ref name=EB/>\n\n===Return to Northumbria and back to Francia===\nIn 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] heresy which was at that time making great progress in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old capital of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule in Spain]]. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fought against Adoptionism. At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]], an [[heresiarch]] according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia.{{sfn|Burns|1907}} Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [[\u00c6thelred I of Northumbria|\u00c6thelred]] in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.\n\nHe was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to \u00c6thelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of [[Lindisfarne]], and to [[\u00c6thelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the succeeding months, dealing with the [[Viking]] attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, ''De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii'', provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: \"''Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of [[St Cuthbert]], splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments''.\"\n\n===Tours and death===\n{{Infobox saint\n|name=Alcuin of York\n|feast_day=20 May\n|work =\n|venerated_in=[[Anglican Communion]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], as a blessed\n|image=Raban-Maur Alcuin Otgar.jpg\n|imagesize=\n|titles= Deacon, Scholar\n|beatified_date=\n|beatified_place=\n|beatified_by=\n|canonized_date=\n|canonized_place=\n|canonized_by=\n|attributes=\n|patronage=\n|major_shrine=\n|suppressed_date=\n}}\nIn 796 Alcuin was in his sixties. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful [[Carolingian minuscule]] script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces.<ref name=EB>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcuin|title=Alcuin &#124; Anglo-Saxon scholar|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nAlcuin died on 19 May 804, some ten years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:\n{{quote|Dust, worms, and ashes now&nbsp;...<br /> Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,<br /> Pray, reader, for my soul.}}\n\nThe majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems.

Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.\n\nIn this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, \"Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.\" His arguments seem to have prevailed \u2013 Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.{{sfn|Needham|2000|p=52}}\n\nCharlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.{{sfn|Wilmot-Buxton|1922|p=93}} Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [[Aachen]], Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils \u2013 derived mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.{{sfn|Jaeger|1999|p=38}} According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', \"He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king's esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.<ref name=EB/>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Burns"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1907"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Needham"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2000"}, {"name": "p", "value": "52"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Wilmot-Buxton"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1922"}, {"name": "p", "value": "93"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Jaeger"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "p", "value": "38"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Return to Northumbria and back to Francia", "paragraphs": "In 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached.

[[Alcuin's sequence]] is the solution to one of the problems of that book.\n\n===Literary influence===\nAlcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [[calligraphy]], the [[Carolingian minuscule]] based on round and legible [[uncial]] letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno, bishop of Salzburg]] and above all to [[Charlemagne]]. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] during the [[Carolingian]] age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.\n\nAlcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans|Theodulf, the Visigoth]] is preponderant.\n\nAlcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work \u2013 a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. These are written in the form of [[dialogues]], and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', and commentaries on the Bible.{{sfn|Page|1909|p=15}} Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known [[question mark]], though it didn't resemble the modern symbol.{{sfn|Truss|2003|p=76}}\n\nAlcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''. At the same time, he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on [[Old English poetry]] surviving from the early Middle Ages, in a letter to one Speratus, the bishop of an unnamed English [[Episcopal see|see]] (possibly [[Unwona]] of Leicester): 'verba Dei legantur in sacerdotali convivio: ibi decet lectorem audiri, non citharistam, sermones patrum, non carmina gentilium. Quid [[Hinieldus]] cum Christo?' ('Let God's words be read at the episcopal dinner-table. It is right that a reader should be heard,  not  a harpist,  patristic  discourse, not  pagan  song.  What  has  [[Hinield]] to do with Christ?').<ref>Donald A. Bullough, 'What has Ingeld to do with Lindisfarne?', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 22 (1993), 93-125 (p. 93 for the Latin [quoted from ''Epistolae Karolini Aevi II'', ed. by E. Dummler, Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Epistula 4 (Berlin, 1895), p. 183 (no. 12)]; p. 124 for the translation); {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100004336}}.</ref>\n\n=== Use of homo-erotic language in writings ===\nAccording to David Clark, passages in some of Alcuin's writings display homosocial desire, even possibly homoerotic imagery. However, Clark says it is not possible to determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings, \"...nor is the question important or productive.\"{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=80}} Historian [[John Boswell]]{{sfn|Boswell|2015|p=254}}{{not in source given|date=September 2019}}{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=16}} cited this as a personal outpouring of Alcuin's internalized [[homosexual]] feelings. Others agree that Alcuin at times \"comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires\", and this reflects the erotic subculture of the [[Carolingian]] monastic school, but also perhaps a 'queer space' where \"erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated\".{{sfn|Coon|2011|p=18}}\n\nErotic and religious love are intertwined in Alcuin's writings, and he frequently \"eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends\". Alcuin's friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters, though David Bromell is of the opinion that Alcuin's relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him.{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=16}}{{not in source given|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlcuin was a close friend of Charlemagne's sister [[Gisela, Abbess of Chelles]], whom he \"hailed as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love\".{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=90}} He wrote to Charlemagne's daughters Rotrudis and Bertha that \"the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me.\"{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=91}} His nickname for Gisela was ''Julia'', for Rotrudis ''Columba''. He dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to them both.{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=91}}\n\nThe interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by [[Allen Frantzen]],{{sfn|Frantzen|1998|p=198}}{{efn |See also {{harvnb|Jaeger|1991}} }} who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian ''amicitia'' or friendship. Karl Liersch, in his 1880 inaugural dissertation, cites several passages from poems by [[Theodulf of Orleans]]. In these poems Theodulf reports that Alcuin had a female muse named Delia at the king's court (she was probably Charlemagne's daughter). Delia is also the addressee of several poems by Alcuin.{{sfn|Liersch|1880|pp=49-50}}\n\nDouglas Dales and [[Rowan Williams]] say \"the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the ''Song of Songs'' transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship \u2013 'an ordained affection'.\"{{sfn|Dales|Williams|2013|p=228}}\n\nDespite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] had been punished with fire for \"sinning against nature with men\"&nbsp;\u2013 a view commonly held by the Church at the time.  Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and merit to be \"withered by flames unto eternal barrenness.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin |editor= J.-P.

However, Clark says it is not possible to determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings, \"...nor is the question important or productive.\"{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=80}} Historian [[John Boswell]]{{sfn|Boswell|2015|p=254}}{{not in source given|date=September 2019}}{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=16}} cited this as a personal outpouring of Alcuin's internalized [[homosexual]] feelings. Others agree that Alcuin at times \"comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires\", and this reflects the erotic subculture of the [[Carolingian]] monastic school, but also perhaps a 'queer space' where \"erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated\".{{sfn|Coon|2011|p=18}}\n\nErotic and religious love are intertwined in Alcuin's writings, and he frequently \"eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends\". Alcuin's friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters, though David Bromell is of the opinion that Alcuin's relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him.{{sfn|Bromell|2002|p=16}}{{not in source given|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlcuin was a close friend of Charlemagne's sister [[Gisela, Abbess of Chelles]], whom he \"hailed as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love\".{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=90}} He wrote to Charlemagne's daughters Rotrudis and Bertha that \"the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me.\"{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=91}} His nickname for Gisela was ''Julia'', for Rotrudis ''Columba''. He dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to them both.{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=91}}\n\nThe interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by [[Allen Frantzen]],{{sfn|Frantzen|1998|p=198}}{{efn |See also {{harvnb|Jaeger|1991}} }} who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian ''amicitia'' or friendship. Karl Liersch, in his 1880 inaugural dissertation, cites several passages from poems by [[Theodulf of Orleans]]. In these poems Theodulf reports that Alcuin had a female muse named Delia at the king's court (she was probably Charlemagne's daughter). Delia is also the addressee of several poems by Alcuin.{{sfn|Liersch|1880|pp=49-50}}\n\nDouglas Dales and [[Rowan Williams]] say \"the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the ''Song of Songs'' transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship \u2013 'an ordained affection'.\"{{sfn|Dales|Williams|2013|p=228}}\n\nDespite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] had been punished with fire for \"sinning against nature with men\"&nbsp;\u2013 a view commonly held by the Church at the time.  Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and merit to be \"withered by flames unto eternal barrenness.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin |editor= J.-P.
