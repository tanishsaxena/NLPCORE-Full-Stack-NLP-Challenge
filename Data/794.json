CE 375) was a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]]ian and [[poet]] from [[ancient India]], of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been \"one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of [[Vikramaditya]],\" and according to the evidence of [[Xuanzang]], this is the [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] ([[Chandragupta II]]) who flourished about CE 375.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name=Rice1970>''Amarakosha'' compiled by [[Benjamin L.
