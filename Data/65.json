Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Segregation (Jim Crow)"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Encyclopedia of Alabama"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "May 26, 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite journal ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Black Belt"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "September 23, 2006"}, {"name": "date", "value": "April 19, 2004"}, {"name": "journal", "value": "Southern Spaces"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Emory University"}, {"name": "doi", "value": "10.18737/M70K6P"}, {"name": "last1", "value": "Tullos"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Allen"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS"}, {"name": "website", "value": "National Register Information System"}, {"name": "url", "value": "{{NRHP url|id=64500011}}"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "October 3, 2012"}]}, {"name": "NRHP url", "values": [{"name": "id", "value": "64500011"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "last1", "value": "Hine"}, {"name": "first1", "value": "Darlene"}, {"name": "last2", "value": "Hine"}, {"name": "first2", "value": "William"}, {"name": "last3", "value": "Harrold"}, {"name": "first3", "value": "Stanley"}, {"name": "title", "value": "African Americans: A Concise History"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2012"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Pearson Education, Inc."}, {"name": "location", "value": "Boston"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780205806270"}, {"name": "pages", "value": "388\u2013389"}, {"name": "edition", "value": "4th"}]}, {"name": "Cite news ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Great Migration {{!}} African-American history"}, {"name": "work", "value": "Encyclopedia Britannica"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "May 26, 2018"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1421"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Birmingham {{!}} Encyclopedia of Alabama"}, {"name": "website", "value": "Encyclopedia of Alabama"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "access-date", "value": "May 26, 2018"}]}, {"name": "Cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab15.txt"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1920"}, {"name": "website", "value": "United States Census Bureau"}, {"name": "archive-url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080814041159/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab15.txt"}, {"name": "archive-date", "value": "August 14, 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}]}, {"name": "Cite book ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/?id=_bq9L27c4fwC&pg=PA149&dq=birmingham+alabama+underrepresented+in+the+state+legislature#v=onepage&q=birmingham%20alabama%20underrepresented%20in%20the%20state%20legislature"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Defending Constitutional Rights"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Johnson"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Frank Minis"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2001"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "University of Georgia Press"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780820322858"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}]}, {"name": "quote", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters.

Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state\u2014along the Tennessee Valley\u2014is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.\n\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[Southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|\u00b0F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|\u00b0F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.\n\nAlabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|\u00b0F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]].

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

Twenty-five of the 67 counties are \"[[Dry county|dry counties]]\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.<ref>[http://abcboard.alabama.gov/%28S%28s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb%29%29/wet_dry_map.aspx Wet-Dry Map] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009231316/http://abcboard.alabama.gov/(S(s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb))/wet_dry_map.aspx |date=October 9, 2016}}, Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.</ref>\n\n[[File:OnoIslandAl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ono Island, Alabama|Ono Island]] in Baldwin County]]\n[[File:MonteSanoStateParkhsval.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Sano State Park]] in Huntsville]]\n[[File:Cathedral Cavern 2019.png|thumb|right|[[Cathedral Caverns State Park|Cathedral Caverns]] in [[Marshall County, Alabama|Marshall County]]]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&year=2006&f=0&off=5&elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results\u2014Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&year=2006&f=0&off=5&elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results\u2014Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, [[at-large]] races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite news ", "values": [{"name": "first", "value": "Phillip"}, {"name": "last", "value": "Rawls"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Alabama offers an apology for slavery"}, {"name": "work", "value": "The Virginian Pilot"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Landmark Communications"}, {"name": "date", "value": "June 1, 2007"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html"}, {"name": "title", "value": "GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years"}, {"name": "last", "value": "White"}, {"name": "first", "value": "David"}, {"name": "date", "value": "November 2, 2010"}, {"name": "work", "value": "[[The Birmingham News]]"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "July 9, 2018"}]}, {"name": "as of", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "2017"}, {"name": "2", "value": "December"}]}, {"name": "cite web ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Elections Data Downloads"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Alabama Secretary of State"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "December 12, 2017"}]}], "id": 31}, {"title": "Elections", "paragraphs": "{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state.
