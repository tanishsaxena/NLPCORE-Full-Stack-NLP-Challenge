As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a [[veganism|vegan]] diet before the term was coined. He was also an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and an advocate for [[women's rights]].\n\nBorn in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] in 1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman. Worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul, he turned to teaching. His innovative methods, however, were controversial, and he rarely stayed in one place very long. His most well-known teaching position was at the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in Boston. His experience there was turned into two books: ''Records of a School'' and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels''. Alcott became friends with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and became a major figure in [[transcendentalism]]. His writings on behalf of that movement, however, are heavily criticized for being incoherent. Based on his ideas for human perfection, Alcott founded [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]], a transcendentalist experiment in community living. The project was short-lived and failed after seven months. Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879. He died in 1888.\n\nAlcott married [[Abby May]] in 1830 and they eventually had four surviving children, all daughters. Their second was [[Louisa May Alcott|Louisa May]], who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' in 1868.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Infobox person\n", "values": [{"name": "name", "value": "Amos Bronson Alcott"}, {"name": "image", "value": "Bronson Alcott from NYPL gallery.jpg"}, {"name": "image_size", "value": "200px"}, {"name": "birth_name", "value": "Amos Bronson Alcox"}, {"name": "birth_date", "value": "{{Birth date|1799|11|29}}"}, {"name": "birth_place", "value": "[[Wolcott, Connecticut]], U.S."}, {"name": "death_date", "value": "{{Death date and age|1888|03|04|1799|11|29}}"}, {"name": "death_place", "value": "[[Boston, Massachusetts]], U.S."}, {"name": "occupation", "value": "Educator <br /> Writer"}, {"name": "spouse", "value": "[[Abby May]]"}, {"name": "children", "value": "[[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Bronson Alcott]], [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott]], [[Abigail May Alcott]]"}]}, {"name": "Birth date", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1799"}, {"name": "2", "value": "11"}, {"name": "3", "value": "29"}]}, {"name": "Death date and age", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1888"}, {"name": "2", "value": "03"}, {"name": "3", "value": "04"}, {"name": "4", "value": "1799"}, {"name": "5", "value": "11"}, {"name": "6", "value": "29"}]}, {"name": "IPAc-en", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "\u02c8"}, {"name": "2", "value": "\u0254\u02d0"}, {"name": "3", "value": "l"}, {"name": "4", "value": "k"}, {"name": "5", "value": "\u0259"}, {"name": "6", "value": "t"}, {"name": "7", "value": ",_"}, {"name": "8", "value": "-"}, {"name": "9", "value": "k"}, {"name": "10", "value": "\u026a"}, {"name": "11", "value": "t"}]}], "id": 0}, {"title": "Life and work", "paragraphs": "\n===Early life===\nA native [[New England]]er, Amos Bronson Alcott was born in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] (then recently renamed from \"Farmingbury\") on November 29, 1799.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=13}}</ref> His parents were Joseph Chatfield Alcott and Anna Bronson Alcott. The family home was in an area known as Spindle Hill, and his father, Joseph Alcox, traced his ancestry to colonial-era settlers in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. The family originally spelled their name \"Alcock\", later changed to \"Alcocke\" then \"Alcox\".

She called him, \"an intelligent, philosophic, modest man\" and found his views on education \"very attractive\".<ref name=Reisen10/> Locals in Cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods. Many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re-opened  private school for boys.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=18}}</ref> On November 6, 1827, Alcott started teaching in [[Bristol, Connecticut]], still using the same methods he used in Cheshire, but opposition from the community surfaced quickly;<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=50}}</ref> he was unemployed by March 1828.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=32}}</ref> He moved to Boston on April 24, 1828, and was immediately impressed, referring to the city as a place \"where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=34}}</ref> He opened the Salem Street Infant School two months later on June 23.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=55}}</ref> Abby May applied as his teaching assistant; instead, the couple were engaged, without consent of the family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=12}}</ref> They were married at [[King's Chapel]] on May 22, 1830; he was 30 years old and she was 29.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father's house.<ref name=Reisen13>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=13}}</ref> After their marriage the Alcotts moved to 12 Franklin Street in Boston, a [[boarding house]] run by a Mrs. Newall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=51}}</ref> Around this time, Alcott also first expressed his public disdain for [[slavery]]. In November 1830, he and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded what he later called a \"preliminary Anti-Slavery Society\", though he differed from Garrison as a [[nonresistance|nonresistant]].<ref>Perry, Lewis. ''Radical Abolitionism: Anarchy and the Government of God in Antislavery Thought''. University of Tennessee Press, 1995: 81.</ref> Alcott became a member of the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]].{{sfn|Bearse|1880|p=3}}\n\nAttendance at Alcott's school was falling. A wealthy [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] named Reuben Haines proposed he and educator William Russell start a new school in Pennsylvania<ref name=Reisen13/> associated with the [[Germantown Academy]]. Alcott accepted and he and his newly pregnant wife set forth on December 14.<ref name=Matteson42>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=42}}</ref> The school was established in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=85}}</ref> and the Alcotts were offered a rent-free home by Haines. Alcott and Russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby [[Philadelphia]] instead.<ref name=Matteson42/> Unsuccessful, they went back to Germantown, though the rent-free home was no longer available and the Alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding-house.<ref name=Matteson43>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=43}}</ref> It was there that their first child, a daughter they named [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Bronson Alcott]], was born on March 16, 1831,<ref name=Reisen13/> after 36 hours of labor.<ref name=Matteson43/> By the fall of that year, their benefactor Haines died suddenly and the Alcotts again suffered financial difficulty. \"We hardly earn the bread\", wrote Abby May to her brother, \"[and] the butter we have to think about.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\nThe couple's only son was born on April 6, 1839, but lived only a few minutes. The mother recorded: \"Gave birth to a fine boy full grown perfectly formed but not living\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=48}}</ref> It was in Germantown that the couple's second daughter was born. [[Louisa May Alcott]] was born on her father's birthday, November 29, 1832, at a half-hour past midnight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=48}}</ref> Bronson described her as \"a very fine healthful child, much more so than Anna was at birth\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=5}}</ref> The Germantown school, however, was faltering; soon only eight pupils remained.<ref name=Matteson50>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=50}}</ref> Their benefactor Haines died before Louisa's birth. He had helped recruit students and even paid tuition for some of them. As Abby wrote, his death \"has prostrated all our hopes here\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=63}}</ref> On April 10, 1833, the family moved to Philadelphia,<ref name=Matteson50/> where Alcott ran a day school. As usual, Alcott's methods were controversial; a former student later referred to him as \"the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=16}}</ref> Alcott began to believe Boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish. He contacted theologian [[William Ellery Channing]] for support. Channing approved of Alcott's methods and promised to help find students to enroll, including his daughter Mary. Channing also secured aid from Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] and Boston mayor [[Josiah Quincy, Jr.]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=53}}</ref>\n\n===Experimental educator===\nOn September 22, 1834, Alcott opened a school of about 30 students, mostly from wealthy families.<ref name=Packer55>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=55}}</ref> It was named the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] because classes were held at the [[Masonic Temple]] on Tremont Street in Boston.<ref name=Dahlstrand110>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=110}}</ref> His assistant was [[Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]], later replaced by [[Margaret Fuller]]. [[Mary Peabody Mann]] served as a French instructor for a time.<ref name=Gura88>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=88}}</ref> The school was briefly famous, and then infamous, because of his original methods. Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in \"spiritual culture\", which included interpretation of the [[Gospel]]s, and advocated ''object teaching'' in writing instruction.<ref>{{Cite book|title = American Journal of Education|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hgkCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Wait, Green, and Company|date = 1828-01-01|language = en|first = William|last = Russell|first2 = William Channing|last2 = Woodbridge|first3 = Amos Bronson|last3 = Alcott}}</ref> He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Jesus]], and William Ellery Channing.<ref name=Dahlstrand110/>\n\nDuring this time, the Alcotts had another child. Born on June 24, 1835, she was named [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott|Elizabeth Peabody Alcott]] in honor of the teaching assistant at the Temple School.<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|pp=66\u201367}}</ref> By age three, however, her mother changed her name to Elizabeth ''Sewall'' Alcott, after her own mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=33}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Record of a School.JPG|thumb|''Record of a School'', a chronicle of Alcott's Temple School, was published in 1835.]]\nIn July 1835, Peabody published her account as an assistant to the Temple School as ''Record of a School: Exemplifying the General Principles of Spiritual Culture''.<ref name=Gura88/> While working on a second book, Alcott and Peabody had a falling out and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels'' was prepared with help from Peabody's sister [[Sophia Peabody|Sophia]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|pp=49\u201350}}</ref> published at the end of December 1836.<ref name=Packer55/> Alcott's methods were not well received; many found his conversations on the Gospels close to blasphemous. For example, he asked students to question if Biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of God.<ref>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=59}}</ref> In the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'', [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]] criticized Alcott's \"flippant and off hand conversation\" about serious topics from the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]] to [[circumcision]].<ref name=Gura89>{{Harvnb|Gura|2007|p=89}}</ref> [[Joseph T.

Reverend [[James Freeman Clarke]] was one of Alcott's few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from Boston periodicals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=97}}</ref> Alcott was rejected by most public opinion and, by the summer of 1837, he had only 11 students left and no assistant after Margaret Fuller moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahlstrand|1982|p=143}}</ref> The controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and, as the school closed, Alcott became increasingly financially desperate. Remaining steadfast to his pedagogy, a forerunner of [[progressive education|progressive]] and [[democratic school]]ing, he alienated parents in a later \"parlor school\" by admitting an [[African American]] child to the class, whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests.\n\n===Transcendentalism===\nBeginning in 1836, Alcott's membership in the [[Transcendental Club]] put him in such company as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Orestes Brownson]] and [[Theodore Parker]].<ref>Buell, Lawrence.

After several revisions, for example, he deemed the essay \"Psyche\" (Alcott's account of how he educated his daughters) unpublishable.<ref name=Reisen35>{{Harvnb|Reisen|2009|p=35}}</ref> Alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] which were eventually published in the Transcendentalists' journal, ''[[The Dial]]''. Emerson wrote to Margaret Fuller, then editor, that they might \"pass muster & even pass for just & great\".<ref name=Packer115/> He was wrong. Alcott's so-called \"[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] Sayings\" were widely mocked for being silly and unintelligible; Fuller herself disliked them, but did not want to hurt Alcott's feelings.<ref name=Packer116>{{Harvnb|Packer|2007|p=116}}</ref> In the first issue, for example, he wrote:\n{{quote|text=Nature is quick with spirit.

Abby May wrote in her journal on January 17, 1843, \"A day of some excitement, as Mr. Alcott refused to pay his town tax...

These \"conversations\" as he called them, were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics, spiritual, aesthetic and practical, in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of American Transcendentalists led by Emerson, who was always his supporter and discreet admirer. He often discussed Platonic philosophy, the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with Spirit; upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature; and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alcott, Amos Bronson|volume=1|page=528|first=Charles F.|last=Richardson}}</ref>\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:Concord School of Philosophy.jpg|left|thumb|Hillside Chapel, home to Alcott's Concord School of Philosophy]]\nAlcott's published books, all from late in his life, include ''Tablets'' (1868), ''Concord Days'' (1872), ''New Connecticut'' (1881), and ''Sonnets and Canzonets'' (1882).

Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in \"spiritual culture\", which included interpretation of the [[Gospel]]s, and advocated ''object teaching'' in writing instruction.<ref>{{Cite book|title = American Journal of Education|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hgkCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Wait, Green, and Company|date = 1828-01-01|language = en|first = William|last = Russell|first2 = William Channing|last2 = Woodbridge|first3 = Amos Bronson|last3 = Alcott}}</ref> He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Jesus]], and William Ellery Channing.<ref name=Dahlstrand110/>\n\nDuring this time, the Alcotts had another child.

Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including \"teach by encouragement\", art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.{{sfn|Richardson|1911|p=528}}\n\nThe Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcott's death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.\n\nWhile many of Alcott's ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal/radical edge, they are still common themes in society, including vegetarian/[[veganism]], sustainable living, and temperance/self-control. Alcott described his sustenance as a \"Pythagorean diet\": meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|1996|p=217}}</ref> Alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well-being to mental improvement. He further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and, in a sense, predicted modern [[environmentalism]] by condemning [[pollution]] and encouraging humankind's role in sustaining ecology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|2010|p=280}}</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Gura"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "p", "value": "87"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bedell"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1980"}, {"name": "p", "value": "53"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Matteson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "p", "value": "58"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Matteson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "p", "value": "59"}]}, {"name": "sfn", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Richardson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1911"}, {"name": "p", "value": "528"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Baker"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1996"}, {"name": "p", "value": "217"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Francis"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2010"}, {"name": "p", "value": "280"}]}], "id": 10}, {"title": "Criticism", "paragraphs": "[[File:Mr Alcott's study.jpg|thumb|left|Alcott in his study at Orchard House]]\nAlcott's philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent, hazy or abrupt.

(editor). ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 152. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}</ref> In his later years, Alcott related a story from his boyhood: during a total [[solar eclipse]], he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder. He reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be \"tilting at the sun and always catching the fall\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Matteson|2007|p=15}}</ref>\n\nLike Emerson, Alcott was always optimistic, idealistic, and individualistic in thinking. Writer [[James Russell Lowell]] referred to Alcott in his poem \"Studies for Two Heads\" as \"an angel with clipped wings\".<ref name=Bedell319/> Even so, Emerson noted that Alcott's brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing. \"When he sits down to write,\" Emerson wrote, \"all his genius leaves him; he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought.\"<ref name=Reisen35/> His \"Orphic Sayings\", published in ''The Dial'', became famous for their hilarity as dense, pretentious, and meaningless. In New York, for example, ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' published a parody titled \"Gastric Sayings\" in November 1840. A writer for the ''Boston Post'' referred to Alcott's \"Orphic Sayings\" as \"a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger\".<ref name=Packer116/>\n\nModern critics{{who|date=October 2011}} often fault Alcott for not being able to financially support his family. Alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man, once writing to his mother that he was \"still at my old trade\u2014hoping.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Schreiner|2006|p=51}}</ref> Alcott held his principles above his well-being. Shortly before his marriage, for example, his future father-in-law Colonel Joseph May helped him find a job teaching at a school in Boston run by the Society of Free Enquirers, followers of [[Robert Owen]], for a lucrative $1,000 to $1,200 annual salary. He refused it because he did not agree with their beliefs, writing, \"I shall have nothing to do with them.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bedell|1980|p=49}}</ref>\n\nFrom the other perspective, Alcott's unique teaching ideas created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Cite book", "values": [{"name": "title", "value": "Amos Bronson Alcott, an intellectual biography"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=sk0rAAAAMAAJ"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Fairleigh Dickinson University Press"}, {"name": "date", "value": "1982-01-01"}, {"name": "isbn", "value": "9780838630167"}, {"name": "language", "value": "en"}, {"name": "first", "value": "Frederick C."}, {"name": "last", "value": "Dahlstrand"}]}, {"name": "ISBN", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "0-86576-008-X"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Matteson"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2007"}, {"name": "p", "value": "15"}]}, {"name": "who", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "October 2011"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Schreiner"}, {"name": "2", "value": "2006"}, {"name": "p", "value": "51"}]}, {"name": "Harvnb", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Bedell"}, {"name": "2", "value": "1980"}, {"name": "p", "value": "49"}]}], "id": 11}, {"title": "Works", "paragraphs": "* ''Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction'' (1830)\n* [https://archive.org/details/doctrinediscipli00alco/page/n2 ''The Doctrine and Discipline of Human Culture''] (1836)\n* ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels'' (Volume I, 1836)\n* ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels'' (Volume II, 1837)\n* [https://archive.org/details/tabletsamos00alcorich ''Tablets''] (1868)\n* ''Concord Days'' (1872)\n* ''Table-Talk'' (1877)\n* [https://archive.org/details/newconnecticutau00alco/page/n10 ''New Connecticut: An Autobiographical Poem''] (1887; first edition privately printed in 1882)\n* ''Sonnets and Canzonets'' (1882)\n* [https://archive.org/details/ralphwaldoemerso00alco/page/n10 ''Ralph Waldo Emerson, Philosopher and Seer: An Estimate of His Character and Genius in Prose and Verse''] (1882)\n* ''The Journals of Bronson Alcott'' (1966)\n\n", "attributes": [], "id": 12}, {"title": "References", "paragraphs": "\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book\n|title = Emerson Among the Eccentrics: A Group Portrait\n|last = Baker\n|first = Carlos\n|year = 1996\n|publisher = Viking Press\n|location = New York\n|isbn = 0-670-86675-X\n|ref = harv\n|url = https://archive.org/details/emersonamongecce00bake\n}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Bearse |first1=Austin |title=Reminiscences of Fugitive-Slave Law Days in Boston |publisher=Warren Richardson |location=Boston |date=1880 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYtuULUUBHYC&printsec=frontcover}} {{free access}}\n*{{cite book\n|title = The Alcotts: Biography of a Family\n|last = Bedell\n|first = Madelon\n|year = 1980\n|publisher = Clarkson N.
