The city's three main canals are the Prinsengracht, Herengracht, and Keizersgracht.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the [[Singel]], which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape.

This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called \"groeikernen\", literally ''cores of growth''.

Huguenots came after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons \u2013 their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was [[History of the Jews in Amsterdam|Jewish]]. Just twenty per cent of them survived the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Netherlands |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-netherlands |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |accessdate=24 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area. Other immigrants, including refugees [[Right of asylum|asylum seekers]] and [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], came from Europe, [[Americas|America]], Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like [[Almere]] and [[Purmerend]], prompted by the third [[Land-use planning|planological]] bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called \"groeikernen\", literally ''cores of growth''. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the [[Jordaan]] abandoned by these Amsterdammers.

The oldest area of the town is known as [[De Wallen]] (English: \"The Quays\"). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of De Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein.\n\nThe medieval and colonial age [[canals of Amsterdam]], known as ''grachten'', embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of [[Jordaan]] and de Pijp. The [[Museumplein]] with the city's major museums, the [[Vondelpark]], a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer [[Joost van den Vondel]], and the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] neighbourhood, with the [[Natura Artis Magistra|zoo]], are also located outside the Grachtengordel.\n\nSeveral parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are [[polder]]s. This can be recognised by the suffix ''-meer'' which means ''lake'', as in [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]].\n\n=== Canals ===\n{{Main|Canals of Amsterdam}}\n[[File:Herengracht-december-2.jpg|thumb|Herengracht]]\n[[File:Prinsengracht towads Lekkeresluis from Bridge Prinsenstraat 2016-09-12.jpg|thumb|Prinsengracht]]\nThe Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious [[Urban planning|city planning]].<ref name=\"canals\">{{cite web\n |url=http://amsterdam.nl/stad_in_beeld/werkstukken/grachten \n |title=Amsterdamse Grachten \n |publisher=Municipality Amsterdam \n |language=Dutch \n |accessdate=21 May 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320060143/http://amsterdam.nl/stad_in_beeld/werkstukken/grachten \n |archivedate=20 March 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n  \n}}</ref> In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] bay. Known as the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]], three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the Herengracht (where \"Heren\" refers to ''Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam'' (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and ''[[gracht]]'' means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as \"Canal of the Lords\"), Keizersgracht (Emperor's Canal), and Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stadsherstel.nl/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/SHVriendenwandeling2017web1.pdf |title=SHVriendenwandeling2017web1.pdf |publisher=stadsherstel |accessdate=9 April 2018 }}</ref> The fourth and outermost canal is the [[Singelgracht]], which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and innermost canal, the [[Singel]].\n\nThe canals served for defence, [[Water resource management|water management]] and transport.

During this period, many buildings were constructed in the [[architectural style]] of the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] fa\u00e7ades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own [[Renaissance architecture]]. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect [[Hendrick de Keyser]].<ref name=\"dekeyser\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/renaiss3.html \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127014006/http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/renaiss3.html \n |archivedate=27 November 2007 \n |title=Amsterdamse renaissance in de stijl van Hendrick de Keyser \n |language=Dutch \n |accessdate=19 May 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n  \n}}</ref> One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the [[Westerkerk]].

A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]].

Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]].

During this period, many buildings were constructed in the [[architectural style]] of the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] fa\u00e7ades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own [[Renaissance architecture]]. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect [[Hendrick de Keyser]].<ref name=\"dekeyser\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/renaiss3.html \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127014006/http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/renaiss3.html \n |archivedate=27 November 2007 \n |title=Amsterdamse renaissance in de stijl van Hendrick de Keyser \n |language=Dutch \n |accessdate=19 May 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n  \n}}</ref> One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the [[Westerkerk]].

A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]]. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by [[Culture of France|French culture]]. This is reflected in the architecture of that period.

At the end of the 19th century, the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]].

The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.<ref name=\"museumpleinfacelift\">{{cite web|url=http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |title=Museumplein krijgt facelift |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807174714/http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |archivedate=7 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Rembrandt]] monument on [[Rembrandtplein]]]]\nThe [[Rijksmuseum]] possesses the largest and most important collection of classical [[Dutch art]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Home Page \n |publisher=Rijksmuseum Amsterdam \n |url=http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/?lang=en \n |accessdate=25 October 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103074636/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/?lang=en \n |archivedate=3 November 2008 \n |url-status=live \n  \n}}</ref>\nIt opened in 1885.

[[Carr\u00e9 Theatre|Royal Theatre Carr\u00e9]] was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals, [[cabaret]] performances and pop concerts.\n\nThe recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses the more commercial plays and musicals. A new theatre has also moved into Amsterdam scene in 2014, joining other established venues: Theater Amsterdam is situated in the west part of Amsterdam, on the Danzigerkade. It is housed in a modern building with a panoramic view over the harbour. The theatre is the first ever purpose-built venue to showcase a single play entitled ANNE, the play based on Anne Frank's life.\n\nOn the east side of town, there is a small theatre in a converted bath house, the [[Badhuistheater]]. The theatre often has English programming.\n\nThe Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or ''kleinkunst'', which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like [[Wim Kan]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy).

The typical ''Bruine Kroeg'' (brown ''caf\u00e9'') breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. These brown caf\u00e9s mostly offer a wide range of local and international artesanal beers. Most ''caf\u00e9s'' have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the [[Leidseplein]] and the [[Rembrandtplein]]. The [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Melkweg]] and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discoth\u00e8ques on some nights. Examples of discoth\u00e8ques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape, Air, John Doe and Club Abe. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), TrouwAmsterdam and Studio 80. In recent years '24-hour' clubs opened their doors, most notably Radion and De School.

A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.<ref name=\"museumpleinfacelift\">{{cite web|url=http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |title=Museumplein krijgt facelift |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807174714/http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |archivedate=7 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Rembrandt]] monument on [[Rembrandtplein]]]]\nThe [[Rijksmuseum]] possesses the largest and most important collection of classical [[Dutch art]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Home Page \n |publisher=Rijksmuseum Amsterdam \n |url=http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/?lang=en \n |accessdate=25 October 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103074636/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/?lang=en \n |archivedate=3 November 2008 \n |url-status=live \n  \n}}</ref>\nIt opened in 1885.

The [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]] are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (''deelraad''), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.\n\nUnder the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.\n\nThe municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (''bestuurscommissies''). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.\n[[File:Amsterdam Amstel.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>View of the [[Stopera]] (left, behind the [[Blauwbrug|blue bridge]]), where the Amsterdam city hall and opera house are located, and the [[Hermitage Amsterdam|Hermitage Museum]] (right) on the [[Amstel]]</center>]]\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n[[File:Police Headquarters, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Police headquarters of Amsterdam]]\n\"Amsterdam\" is usually understood to refer to the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of [[Durgerdam]], may not be considered part of Amsterdam.\n\n[[Statistics Netherlands]] uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (''Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam'', not to be confused with ''Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam'', a synonym of ''Groot Amsterdam''), Greater Amsterdam (''Groot Amsterdam'', a [[COROP]] region) and the urban region Amsterdam (''Stadsgewest Amsterdam'').<ref name=\"cbs2013\"/> The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of [[Zaanstad]] and [[Wormerland]]. It excludes [[Graft-De Rijp]].\n\nThe smallest of these areas is the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013.<ref name=\"cbs2013\"/> The conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013.<ref name=\"cbs2013\"/> It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam.<ref name=\"cbs2013\"/> Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities,<ref name=\"cbs2013\"/> and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013.<ref name=\"cbs2013\"/> Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of [[Zaanstad]].

The ceremony traditionally takes place at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] on [[Dam Square]], immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in [[The Hague]], the city which has historically been the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], and the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch supreme court]]. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}}\nThe coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' (\"Heroic, Determined, Merciful\"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Government of Amsterdam"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values":

The [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]] are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (''deelraad''), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.\n\nUnder the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.\n\nThe municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (''bestuurscommissies''). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.\n[[File:Amsterdam Amstel.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>View of the [[Stopera]] (left, behind the [[Blauwbrug|blue bridge]]), where the Amsterdam city hall and opera house are located, and the [[Hermitage Amsterdam|Hermitage Museum]] (right) on the [[Amstel]]</center>]]\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "Boroughs of Amsterdam"}, {"name": "2", "value": "Municipal council (Netherlands)"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://dutchreview.com/news/politics/electing-a-mayor-in-the-netherlands"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Electing a mayor in the Netherlands"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Maria Smith"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "DutchReview.com"}, {"name": "date", "value": "15 February 2018"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "15 February 2018"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/06/12/three-party-coalition-amsterdam-pvda/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Three-party coalition in Amsterdam"}, {"name": "author", "value": "Britt Slegers"}, {"name": "work", "value": "NL Times"}, {"name": "date", "value": "12 June 2014"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "13 August 2014"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.amsterdam.nl/gemeente/college/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "College van burgemeester en wethouders"}, {"name": "language", "value": "Dutch"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "City of Amsterdam"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "13 August 2014"}]}, {"name": "dead link", "values": [{"name": "date", "value": "April 2018"}, {"name": "bot", "value": "InternetArchiveBot"}, {"name": "fix-attempted", "value": "yes"}]}], "id": 35}, {"title": " Metropolitan area ", "paragraphs": "[[File:Police Headquarters, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Police headquarters of Amsterdam]]\n\"Amsterdam\" is usually understood to refer to the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam.

The biggest Montessori high school in Amsterdam is the [[Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam]]. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.\n\nAmsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the [[Vossius Gymnasium]], [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]], St. [[Ignatius Gymnasium]], [[Het 4e Gymnasium]] and the Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.\n\nSchools for foreign nationals in Amsterdam include the [[Amsterdam International Community School]], [[British School of Amsterdam]], [[Albert Einstein International School Amsterdam]], [[Lyc\u00e9e Vincent van Gogh La Haye-Amsterdam]] primary campus (French school), [[International School of Amsterdam]], and the [[Japanese School of Amsterdam]].\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Hortus Botanicus official website"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "2009 de Hortus"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "10 June 2009"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20090831051745/http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "31 August 2009"}]}, {"name": "cite web\n ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.amsterdam.info/universities/"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Higher Education in Amsterdam"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "Amsterdam.info"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "4 June 2008"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080704195020/http://www.amsterdam.info/universities/"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "4 July 2008"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "live"}]}, {"name": "in lang", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "nl"}]}], "id": 45}, {"title": " Notable people ", "paragraphs": "{{main|List of people from Amsterdam}}\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "List of people from Amsterdam"}]}], "id": 46}, {"title": " Media ", "paragraphs": "Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media.

However, Amsterdam is not considered 'the media city of the Netherlands'. The town of [[Hilversum]], {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands. [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Netherlands]], heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies.\n\nIn 2012, the music video of Far East Movement, 'Live My Life', was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam.\n\nAlso, several movies were filmed in Amsterdam, such as [[James Bond]]'s [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]], [[Ocean's Twelve]], [[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]] and [[The Hitman's Bodyguard]].
