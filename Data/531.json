The last whorl, known as the [[body whorl]], is [[wikt:auriform|auriform]], meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name \"ear shell\". ''[[Haliotis asinina]]'' has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended.

They make up what is known as the [[selenizone]], which forms as the shell grows. This series of eight to 38 holes is near the anterior margin. Only a small number is generally open. The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form. Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and 10, in the selenizone. An abalone has no [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]]. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] of the shell is very wide and [[wikt:nacreous|nacreous]].\n\nThe exterior of the shell is striated and dull.

The [[radula]] has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like. They have about 70 [[uncini]], with [[wikt:denticulated|denticulated]] hooks, the first four very large. The rounded foot is very large in comparison to most molluscs. The soft body is coiled around the [[Columella (gastropod)|columellar muscle]], and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell. The [[gill]]s are symmetrical and both well developed.<ref name=\"Tryon\">{{harvnb|Tryon, Jr.|1880|p=41}}</ref>\n\nThese snails cling solidly with their broad, muscular foot to rocky surfaces at [[Sublittoral zone|sublittoral]] depths, although some species such as ''[[Haliotis cracherodii]]'' used to be common in the [[intertidal zone]]. Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size. Their [[fecundity]] is high and increases with their size, laying from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time.

The meat of this mollusc is considered a [[delicacy]] in certain parts of [[Latin America]] (particularly [[Chile]]), [[France]], [[New Zealand]], [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. In the Greater China region and among Overseas Chinese communities, abalone is commonly known as ''[[bao yu]]'', and sometimes forms part of a Chinese banquet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the same way as [[shark fin soup]] or [[bird's nest soup]], abalone is considered a [[luxury item]], and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations. However, the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAbalone started to become popular after the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]] in 1915.<ref name=jo>{{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=65}}</ref>\n\nAs abalone became more popular and less common, the prices adjusted accordingly. In the 1920s, a restaurant-served portion of abalone, about 4 ounces, would cost (in inflation adjusted dollars) about $7; by 2004, the price had risen to $75.<ref name=jo/> In America, prior to this time, abalone was predominantly eaten, gathered, and prepared by Chinese immigrants.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=66}}</ref> Before that, abalone were collected to be eaten, and used for other purposes by Native American tribes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Seaweed, Salmon, and Manzanita Cider: A California Indian Feast|last=Dubin|first=Margaret|publisher=Heyday Books|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Tolley|editor-first=Sara-Larus|location=|pages=}}</ref> By 1900, laws were passed in California to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone. This forced the Chinese out of the market and the Japanese perfected diving, with or without gear, to enter the market. By the time of the exposition, Americans were starting to discover abalone. The popularity of abalone, along with many other fish and shellfish, increased as the exposition exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations, and a 1300-seat dining hall.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=70}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, live and raw abalones are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in [[soy sauce]].

The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western, with each fisher required a zone-allocated licence. Harvesting is performed by divers using surface-supplied air \"hookah\" systems operating from runabout-style, outboard-powered boats. While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds, the deckhand operates the boat, known as working \"live\" and stays above where the diver is working. Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of \"shot line\", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved. Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell. Since 2002, the Victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 [[fishing year]], due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus [[ganglioneuritis]], which is fast-spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California (CHS-1399).jpg|thumb|Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California, ''circa'' 1900]]\n[[File:Japanese Abalone Diver.jpg|thumb|A young Japanese Abalone Diver in California in 1905]]\n[[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|right|Two highly endangered white abalone: Prohibitions on commercial and recreational harvest of this species have been \nin place since 1996.]]\nSport harvesting of [[red abalone]] is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card.

Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as [[kelp]]. An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it has time to fully clamp down.

''Haliotis iris'' (or blackfoot ''paua'') is the ubiquitous New Zealand ''paua'', the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence. ''[[Haliotis australis]]'' and ''[[Haliotis virginea]]'' are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than ''H. iris''.\n\nLike all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of ''paua'' does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] (MPI) are followed. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver, with a minimum shell length of {{convert|125|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. iris'' and {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. australis''. In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 ''paua'' or more than {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}} of ''paua'' meat at any one time. ''Paua'' can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear.\n\nAn extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat. This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest ''paua'' can be granted legally under [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The limit is strictly enforced by roving [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.  [[Poaching]] is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment.\n\n====South Africa====\nThe largest abalone in South Africa, ''[[Haliotis midae]]'', occurs along roughly two-thirds of the country's coastline. Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by [[Illegal fishing in Africa|illegal commercial harvesting]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plag\u00e1nyi|first=\u00c9va|last2=Butterworth|first2=Doug|last3=Burgener|first3=Markus|date=2011-01-01|title=Illegal and unreported fishing on abalone\u2014Quantifying the extent using a fully integrated assessment model|journal=Fisheries Research|volume=107|issue=1\u20133|pages=221\u2013232|doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.005}}</ref> In South Africa, all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.\n\nFor the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by [[Criminal organization|syndicates]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2007}}</ref>\nIn 2007, because of widespread [[poaching]] of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the [[CITES]] section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species. This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls. Export permits are still required, however.\nThe abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries. As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram. There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.\n\n==== Channel-Islands, Brittany and Normandy ====\nOrmers (''[[Green ormer|Haliotis tuberculata]]'') are considered a delicacy in the British [[Channel Islands]] as well as in adjacent areas of [[France]], and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals.

Unlike the Oriental Natural, the Akoya pearl, and the South Sea and Tahitian cultured pearls, abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness. The inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours, ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples, creams and pinks. Therefore, each pearl, natural or cultured, will have its own unique collage of colours.\n\nThe shells of abalone are occasionally used in New Age [[smudging]] ceremonies to catch falling ash. They have also been used as incense burners.\n\n=== Native use ===\nAbalone has been an important staple in native cultures around the world, specifically in Africa and on the North American West coast.

The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western, with each fisher required a zone-allocated licence. Harvesting is performed by divers using surface-supplied air \"hookah\" systems operating from runabout-style, outboard-powered boats. While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds, the deckhand operates the boat, known as working \"live\" and stays above where the diver is working. Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of \"shot line\", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved. Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell. Since 2002, the Victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 [[fishing year]], due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus [[ganglioneuritis]], which is fast-spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California (CHS-1399).jpg|thumb|Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California, ''circa'' 1900]]\n[[File:Japanese Abalone Diver.jpg|thumb|A young Japanese Abalone Diver in California in 1905]]\n[[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|right|Two highly endangered white abalone: Prohibitions on commercial and recreational harvest of this species have been \nin place since 1996.]]\nSport harvesting of [[red abalone]] is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card. In 2008, the abalone card also came with a set of 24 tags.

Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell. Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell. Only red abalone may be taken, as [[Black abalone|black]], [[White abalone|white]], [[Haliotis corrugata|pink]], [[Haliotis walallensis|flat]], [[Green abalone|green]], and [[Northern abalone|pinto]] abalone are protected by law.<ref name=cal15c/> In 2018, The [[California Fish and Game Commission]] closed recreational abalone season due to dramatically declining populations.

Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone. Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as [[kelp]]. An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it has time to fully clamp down. Divers dive from boats, kayaks, tube floats, or directly off the shore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe largest abalone recorded in California is {{convert|12.34|in|cm|abbr=on}}, caught by John Pepper somewhere off the coast of [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] in September 1993.<ref name=\"Smookler2005p76\">{{harvnb|Smookler|2005|p=76}}</ref>\n\nThe mollusc ''[[Concholepas concholepas]]'' is often sold in the United States under the name \"Chilean abalone\", though it is not an abalone, but a [[Muricidae|muricid]].\n\n====New Zealand====\n{{Main|Paua}}\nIn New Zealand, abalone is called ''paua'' ({{IPAc-en|'|p|a\u028a|\u0259}}, from the [[M\u0101ori language]]). ''Haliotis iris'' (or blackfoot ''paua'') is the ubiquitous New Zealand ''paua'', the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence. ''[[Haliotis australis]]'' and ''[[Haliotis virginea]]'' are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than ''H. iris''.\n\nLike all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of ''paua'' does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] (MPI) are followed. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver, with a minimum shell length of {{convert|125|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. iris'' and {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. australis''. In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 ''paua'' or more than {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}} of ''paua'' meat at any one time. ''Paua'' can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear.\n\nAn extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat. This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest ''paua'' can be granted legally under [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The limit is strictly enforced by roving [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.  [[Poaching]] is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment.\n\n====South Africa====\nThe largest abalone in South Africa, ''[[Haliotis midae]]'', occurs along roughly two-thirds of the country's coastline. Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by [[Illegal fishing in Africa|illegal commercial harvesting]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plag\u00e1nyi|first=\u00c9va|last2=Butterworth|first2=Doug|last3=Burgener|first3=Markus|date=2011-01-01|title=Illegal and unreported fishing on abalone\u2014Quantifying the extent using a fully integrated assessment model|journal=Fisheries Research|volume=107|issue=1\u20133|pages=221\u2013232|doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.005}}</ref> In South Africa, all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.\n\nFor the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by [[Criminal organization|syndicates]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2007}}</ref>\nIn 2007, because of widespread [[poaching]] of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the [[CITES]] section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species. This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls. Export permits are still required, however.\nThe abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries. As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram. There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.\n\n==== Channel-Islands, Brittany and Normandy ====\nOrmers (''[[Green ormer|Haliotis tuberculata]]'') are considered a delicacy in the British [[Channel Islands]] as well as in adjacent areas of [[France]], and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals. This, and a recent lethal bacterial disease,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/island-life/history-heritage/ormers/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618131323/http://jerseyeveningpost.com/island-life/history-heritage/ormers/ |archive-date=18 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and \"ormering\" is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks. The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following. No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under {{convert|80|mm|in}} in shell length. Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater. Any breach of these laws is a criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to \u00a35,000 or six months in prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014b}}</ref> The demand for ormers is such that they led to the

''[[Haliotis australis]]'' and ''[[Haliotis virginea]]'' are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than ''H. iris''.\n\nLike all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of ''paua'' does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] (MPI) are followed. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver, with a minimum shell length of {{convert|125|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. iris'' and {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. australis''.
