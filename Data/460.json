Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted [[village cooperatives]] to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.\n\nPeasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.\n\n===Tunisia===\n\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.\n\n====Czechoslovakia====\nIn [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Sharon Werning Rivera, \"Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\" ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208.</ref>\n\n====France====\nIn [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the [[2002 French presidential election]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]].\n\n====Ireland====\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish [[landlordism]] in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The \"[[Land War]]\" of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers.\n\nPost-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.\n\n[[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.\n\n====Lithuania====\nIn Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]].\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined.\n\n====Romania====\nIn [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928\u20131930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996\u20132000.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929.

Crowley finds that:\n: Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, as well as more healthy, more important and more productive, than life in the towns and cities....The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior.<ref>F.K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1901 \u2013 1939'' (1973) pp 77-78.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Party of Australia]] (formerly called the Country Party), from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called \"[[countrymindedness]]\".  The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.<ref>Rae Wear, \"Countrymindedness Revisited,\" (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nThe [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called \"[[populism]].\" [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]].\n\nTo obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.<ref>James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346</ref><ref>Tom Brooking, \"'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&action=null online]</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "Main", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "List of agrarian parties"}]}, {"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archived copy"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2015-06-19"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2014-10-31"}]}, {"name": "cite news ", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0"}, {"name": "title", "value": "With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine"}, {"name": "newspaper", "value": "[[The New York Times]]"}]}, {"name": "webarchive", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf"}, {"name": "date", "value": "2011-07-23"}]}, {"name": "cite book ", "values": [{"name": "author", "value": "Leslie Lipson"}, {"name": "title", "value": "The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy"}, {"name": "url", "value": "https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ"}, {"name": "year", "value": "1948"}, {"name": "publisher", "value": "U. of Chicago Press"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "3,100,000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "acres"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ha"}]}, {"name": "convert", "values": [{"name": "1", "value": "1,300,000"}, {"name": "2", "value": "acres"}, {"name": "3", "value": "ha"}]}], "id": 3}, {"title": "Tunisia", "paragraphs": "\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n", "attributes": [{"name": "cite web", "values": [{"name": "url", "value": "http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf"}, {"name": "title", "value": "Archived copy"}, {"name": "accessdate", "value": "2015-06-19"}, {"name": "url-status", "value": "dead"}, {"name": "archiveurl", "value": "https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf"}, {"name": "archivedate", "value": "2014-10-31"}]}], "id": 4}, {"title": "Europe", "paragraphs": "\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives.
